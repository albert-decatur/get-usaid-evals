"Evaluates project to support efforts by the Association for Voluntary Sterilization (AVS) to provide sterilization and family planning (FP) services.  External final evaluation covers the period 1982-1985 and is based on document review, interviews with project personnel, and site visits to 7 countries. AVS has surpassed project targets (in, e.g., training, support of clinic-based services, maintenance of sterilization equipment), and has made considerable progress in voluntarism, medical surveillance, and management as well.  Program direction is consistent, staff are well qualified, financial and administrative practices are sound, and morale is high. AVS has initiated a movement to post a medical advisor in each project region to provide TA to subproject staff, an action which A.I.D. should encourage.  Such a system has already been approved in Bangladesh and would, if introduced in other areas, facilitate communications and improve medical reporting. AVS has taken great precautions to ensure strict voluntarism in all projects it supports; no evidence of coercion has been observed or reported in any AVS-supported activities.  Increased emphasis has been put on counseling, to ensure that prospective acceptors are fully informed of alternative FP measures and of the irreversibility of sterilization before undergoing sterilization.  Follow-up surveys of acceptor satisfaction have been conducted in five countries and initial results have been favorable. Tangentially, the closely allied World Federation of Health Agencies for the Advancement of Voluntary Surgical Contraception has played a positive role in advancing professional education, medical quality assurance, leadership, and policy development as well as information dissemination.  A.I.D. and the Federation need to work more closely together, however. Because AVS has successfully assisted private and public institutions in providing safe and affordable sterilization services, it is recommended that funding be continued for the next five years.  Other recommendations are also included.","Evaluation period: 1982-1985|Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-C-00-4063-00","","1/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Sterilization (birth control)","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS304.pdf","4,064 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Despite relatively constant levels of military aid, there is a stark contrast between Thailand's strategic importance to the United States and the dwindling levels of economic aid that it receives.  This report explores the following five major aspects of the overall U.S. aid program to Thailand in the context of the uneasy relationship between security and developmental concerns since the 1950's. (1) Security and economic development.  Historically, security considerations have been paramount in the provision of economic aid (e.g., a number of road-building projects were more notable for their security applications).  (2) Stabilization of Thai frontiers.  A major element in U.S. assistance has been bolstering Thai national unity by improving the GOT's presence in remote regions, particularly the northeast (through building roads and police stations, training security forces, etc.), to uncertain effect.  (3) Helping the rural poor.  A.I.D. programs, inasmuch as they have attempted to enhance the power of the GOT, have tended to benefit the bureaucratic elite more than the rural poor. (4)  Private sector support.  A.I.D. has increased its activities in support of the Thai private sector, but whether this has contributed to Thailand's rapid economic growth is uncertain.  At any rate, common distinctions between ""public"" and ""private"" sector entities tend not to apply under Thailand's ""patrimonial"" system, which encourages intimate ties between government and  industry officials. (5) Institution building, training, and technical assistance.  A.I.D. has worked to increase the administrative capacity of the Thai government, which has served to reinforce traditional bureaucratic values. Current U.S. strategy focuses on remediating specific sectoral problems, such as increasing rural employment and the value-added in exports.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Military assistance|Economic assistance","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS326.pdf","349 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates cooperative agreement with the East-West Population Institute (EWPI) to promote broader and more effective use of demographic data and population analysis in Asian and Pacific countries. Mid-term evaluation covers the period 9/83-8/85 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with EWPI staff. EWPI staff are highly qualified and competent, especially in demographic research, and have actively worked with census offices and registrars, particularly in East and Southeast Asia. Considerable quantitative progress has been made in five of the six project areas, i.e., in workshops and conferences, working groups, research, resource materials, and publications.  However, there is some semantic confusion regarding the sixth area, technical consultation, which is defined by EWPI broadly to include consultation and technical cooperation, but by A.I.D. more narrowly as technical assistance; in A.I.D.'s view, there is definitely a deficit in this area. A.I.D. is also concerned with the strategy EWPI has employed, which has been more academic than applied, implemented more at EWPI headquarters in Hawaii than in Asia, focused more on analysis of demographic trends than on program and policy analysis, and more concerned with East and Southeast Asia than with A.I.D.'s high priority countries in South Asia.  A.I.D. would like to see EWPI be more direct in its capacity building efforts, i.e., provide more onsite TA and training and increase dissemination of research findings to policymakers, planners, and program managers.  EWPI is willing to modify the project's workscope to better fit A.I.D. priorities. A.I.D.'s involvement in the project, particularly at Mission level, has been limited, but both A.I.D. and EWPI appear willing to increase their interaction through more frequent personal contacts and more focused reporting.  Project expenditures are on schedule, but reimbursement by A.I.D. has recently been slow. A modified program for the cooperative agreement, which would include more emphasis on policy-relevant research, capacity building, and information dissemination - is suggested.  Other issues needing to be addressed include a gap in project direction due to the extended leave of the the co-principal investigator and the lack of a line item for funding key EWPI personnel.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-C-00-4063-00","","1/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Demographic analysis|Population policy|Personnel development","Asia|Oceania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS394.pdf","1,637 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates project in Nepal to promote the institutional development of the National Commission on Population (NCP) and to support the development of a national population policy. External end of project evaluation covers the period 1979-7/85 and is based on document review and interviews with officials of the NCP, His Majesty's Government (HMG), and with other donor representatives. The project has been in decline since mid 1983, but before then made useful progress in a number of areas.  The most significant accomplishment was NCP's lead in the government-wide population planning process, which culminated in an ambitious, but feasible, National Population Strategy aimed at reducing Nepal's total fertility rate to 2.5 by the year 2000.  A number of other activities were undertaken, including vigorous pursuit of research projects (43 research studies and major reports were carried out) and dissemination of information about population through publications and seminars.  The NCP's capacity to manage the research process grew steadily and over time the studies themselves became less theoretical and more relevant. Participant training has been successful.  Thirty persons will have received training abroad; all who have completed their studies have returned to Nepal and all but one are using the knowledge they gained in their work. The project's inclusion of participants from private, nonprofit research organizations and from junior professional ranks of government is unusual in Nepal, reflecting useful managerial initiative by the NCP. Strong support at the highest levels of HMG was a critical component of the project's successes, especially in formulating a population strategy.  The support ceased, however, with a change in political leadership, and the current HMG leaders have tended to ignore the NCP. The downturn of project activities began in mid-1983 as a result, and at present both NCP institutional strength and implementation of population strategy have waned. The project teaches that while much can be accomplished in a relatively short time by focusing assistance on key development policy issues, policy accomplishments are fragile, dependent on continued active support from top political leaders. Proposals have been made to transfer the NCP's training and basic research functions to a new organization, which would take over operations research and policy-related research while assuming all public information functions.  These proposals would seriously weaken the NCP.  Nine recommendations provided instead address revitalization of the NCP and its political base.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-C-00-4063-00","","1/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Population programs|Population planning|Population policy","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS565.pdf","5,131 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates the performance of an RSSA team from the U.S. Census Bureau's Center for International Research (CIR) in a project to collect and analyze demographic data for A.I.D.'s Population Division (POP). External evaluation, funded under project 9363024, covers the period 1982-1985 and is based on site visits and interviews with organizations working with CIR. The CIR has fulfilled its major obligations under the RSSA, namely, to compile, assess, and disseminate demographic and related socioeconomic data on a world-wide basis.  CIR's international data base (IDB) is a reasonably up-to-date, competently evaluated data set which probably provides statistics superior to those produced by the UN Population Division and the World Bank.  The CIR staff has strong technical competence and the quality and quantity of work are high. Also, staff members have greatly contributed to demographic literature through independently conducted research. The CIR is weak, however, in certain areas with relevance to AID-supported projects.  (1) The IDB has limited information on contraceptive prevalence and detailed fertility rates.  (2) The CIR acknowledges that its publications are sporadic, limited, and unattractive and fail to adequately represent the richness of the IDB. (3) There is little communication between POP and CIR. All three problems are remediable.  The CIR is very receptive to the suggestion that it pursue and evaluate data on contraceptive prevalence as vigorously as it does traditional demographic variables.  To do so, the IDB would have to be upgraded and software provided which could generate a pre-selected listing or grouping of countries and cross-classification of variables. Greater use could also be made of the CIR staff to train LDC nationals in demographic techniques and analysis. Finally, the time is auspicious for improving communication between POP and CIR.  A.I.D. could direct to CIR its ad hoc requests for sophisticated demographic expertise, and CIR would be better positioned to do policy-relevant research if it had more direct and frequent communication with AID/W and field staff.  It is recommended that A.I.D. fund a follow-on project at the present or higher levels.

"Evaluates two subprojects (SP's) to provide secondary school scholarships to women in Bangladesh so as to increase their employment opportunities and family planning (FP) behavior. External evaluation, funded under project 9363024, covers the period through 11/85 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with host government, nongovernmental organization (NGO), and other-donor personnel. It appears that the SP's are having very beneficial effects - increasing female school enrollment, raising the age of marriage, lowering desired family size, and positively affecting FP knowledge, attitudes, and practices.  Effects on female employment (in the Western sense), on the other hand, seem minimal. Some 6,056 young women are currently receiving stipends covering approximately half of their schooling costs - 3,456 under the first SP, which is administered by the Bangladesh Association for Community Education (BACE), and 2,600 under the second, administered by Southern Gonounnayan Samity (SGS).  The Asia Foundation (TAF) has oversight responsibilities for both SP's. Both TAF and SGS have effectively fulfilled their implementation responsibilities, but BACE continues to have the administrative and management problems documented in earlier evaluations.  If substantial improvement is not seen within a year, USAID/B should seriously consider terminating BACE funding and reallocating the funds to a similar project through another NGO. Although there is great need to expand the scholarship program on a national basis, financial and managerial constraints make this impossible.  A more gradual expansion over the next 20 years, however, could play an important interim role in the Bangladeshi educational system until the government is ready to take over all secondary schools, and would significantly lower the population growth rate.  It is recommended that at least 50% of A.I.D. funding for female education/employment programs be directed to the program to allow immediate expansion from 2 to 15 upazillas. A variety of other female education/employment initiatives to decrease fertility are also suggested.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABE-772|Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-C-00-4063-00","","3/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Secondary education|Women in development|Scholarships|Determinants of fertility|Beneficiary count","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS855.pdf","2,231 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates core grant to Agricultural Cooperative Development International (ACDI) to help establish agricultural cooperatives and credit systems.  Outside evaluation covers the period through 12/85 and is based on document review, site visits in Guatemala, Honduras, and the Philippines, and interviews with Mission, host government, and co-op officials and with farmers. Although ACDI is capably staffed and has pursued grant objectives with vigor, only partial success has been achieved due to limited demand for ACDI assistance - which in turn reflects the low priority given to cooperative development by host governments and A.I.D. Missions (especially in the Asia Region).  ACDI has had the greatest success with cooperative management training, the least in creating self-sustaining, financially viable organizations.  Results have varied among countries and regions, however, and have been largely dependent on the availability of Mission funding, as matching grants have generally not been forthcoming.  It is unlikely that ACDI will become even partially self-sustaining in the near term, unless it greatly improves its ability to generate matching grants. In the Asia/Pacific Region, the effectiveness of ACDI's regional representative has been limited, not by his qualifications, but by minimal demand for his services, which since 8/84 have been utilized by only one Mission and that for a period of less than one month; no increase in demand is likely. ACDI's equally well-qualified Latin America/Caribbean representative, on the other hand, though mostly (75%) funded through a bilateral contract with USAID/Guatemala, has been employed by many co-ops and Missions, several of which have recommended extending his services when the USAID/G contract terminates in 1/86.  However, no cooperative-to-cooperative contacts between U.S. and LAC co-ops have been initiated during the representative's tenure; it seems that U.S. co-ops lack interest in such contacts. A core grant such as this one provides valuable resources to support Mission projects in institution building; without such resources, the success of many such projects would be in doubt. Nonetheless, continued central funding for independent ACDI activity is difficult to justify unless A.I.D. gives more priority to cooperative development and ACDI finds additional funding sources.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural cooperatives|Cooperative development organizations|Institution building|Technical assistance|Limited data plus","Latin America|Caribbean|Asia|Honduras|Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS878.pdf","1,400 KB","004644 - AmerInd, Inc.","","004490 - USAID.

"Agricultural credit unions and cooperatives can be agents of integrated rural development, according to this impact evaluation of a project to assist cooperatives and credit unions in Ecuador during the period 1962-76. A.I.D. assistance to the credit union movement can be claimed as an unequivocal success.  Ecuadorean credit unions have 2.5 million members and provide major impetus for rural development, especially in the agricultural sector.  A.I.D. assistance to agricultural cooperatives has had a less widespread, though still catalytic impact on rural development, an impact which is due mainly to the fact that co-op membership in Ecuador is associated with land acquisition and with the creation of new communities; in many cases, cooperatives were the first or main community organization, through which members expressed demands for health, education, and other services.  Ironically, the Improved Rural Life (IRL) program, a small project add-on specifically aimed at helping co-op members acquire multisectoral services, had little effect on integrated rural development.  The primary reason for this difference is that the cooperative approach, unlike the IRL, succeeded in rewarding community participation and initiative. However, of the five cooperative federations assisted by A.I.D. under the project, only the credit union federation attained financial viability.  Several lessons pertinent to cooperative development can be learned:  (1) financial viability is hard for agricultural cooperative federations to achieve, because in most cases there is no obvious service that they can provide more effectively than the private or governmental sectors; (2) credit programs for co-ops must be linked with skilled technical assistance; (3) technical agricultural skills must be conveyed to cooperative farmers at the outset; and (4) education in cooperative management is essential at all levels to alleviate problems like those facing Ecuadorean cooperatives today - infighting and lack of communication, corruption and poor financial management, lack of unified leadership, and the as yet unaddressed issue of how to replenish the leadership cadre in successful cooperatives, all of which are dominated by one to three leaders.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural cooperatives|Credit unions|Agricultural credit|Integrated rural development","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL062.pdf","1,950 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help LDC organizations analyze and disseminate population and family planning (FP) information. Mid-term external evaluation covers the period through 6/85 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with Westinghouse Health Systems (WHS), A.I.D., and LDC personnel. The small WHS project staff has performed well and targets are being met or exceeded in all areas save that of population reports:  13 countries, plus the Sahel Institute, have received TA visits (total of 33 trips); microcomputer systems have been installed in 7 countries, and related training and software supplied; 4 comprehensive population/FP data files have been developed; 76 requests for special tabulations and basic information have been filled; and 18 policy briefs have been prepared. The volume of requests for TA and microcomputers has been far greater than expected.  In response, WHS has been very resourceful in stretching funds as far as possible.  TA recipients and Missions have been uniformly pleased with results, and WHS staff are viewed as both competent and easy to work with. Adapted microcomputer systems have been expertly installed, carefully planned, and adequately tested.  Problems over responsibility for computer maintenance, not unusual in such projects, have been resolved in each instance.  However, the demographic analysis program manual produced by WHS needs to be simplified and there is a need for Spanish-language documentation and training materials (e.g., lesson plans).  Also, insufficient time has been given to follow-up training. While the data files prepared are useful for a variety of audiences, requests for data (especially requests requiring data analysis) take up considerable staff time, and there is a question as to whether requests from non-AID personnel should be discouraged.  Also, inadequate facilities and personnel shortages at the A.I.D. computer center constrain the efficient use of the files. Preparation and dissemination of population reports are far behind schedule and of those planned, only two - on natural FP and on microcomputer applications - are of importance to the project and should be completed.  Generally, WHS should focus instead on responding to TA requests.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-C-00-4063-00","","3/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Demographic analysis|Family planning|Information dissemination|Information storage and retrieval systems|Technical assistance|Computer technology","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAT004.pdf","3,908 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"The performance of project design approaches which maximize flexibility during implementation and thus allow for mid-course changes is compared with that of traditional, more specific designs.  An initial section summarizes the two perspectives, citing experience with irrigation projects to clarify how flexible designs differ from standard project designs.  The use of flexible design concepts by USAID/Phillipines in four core projects provides the basis for discussion in section two of common design characteristics and the Mission's experience with initial implementation.  Particular attention is given to the project management demands of these projects.  Also, a distinction is made between two types of flexible design - rolling design, which specifies a project's ends but not its means, and process design, which remains general in regard to both.  Advantages and disadvantages of flexible design are discussed and recommendations regarding its use provided.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Development project design|Development project management|Case studies|Irrigation|USAID","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAU631.pdf","103 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Evaluates biomethanation program at the AID-supported Centre de Developpement des Energies Renouvelables (CDER) in Morocco. Special external evaluation covers the period 1980-3/86 and is based on document review; visits to university laboratories and rural biogas plants; and interviews with CDER, Government of Morocco, Peace Corps, and university personnel. CDER has succeeded in a relatively short time in establishing a staffed organization in temporary office and laboratory facilities (while permanent facilities are being built), developing cooperative programs with other agencies and institutions, and commencing a varied program in renewable energy activities.  On the other hand, however, CDER needs a stronger analytical and economic justification for its current and planned biomethanation program; the choice of digester type and design has been based more on experience of other countries (specifically, the People's Republic of China) than on Moroccan needs; and CDER's role in biomethanation - whether as a catalyzing organization or a major actor - is unclear. It is recommended that CDER:  (1) immediately begin a series of studies to collect the data needed to justify a biomethanation program; (2) plan these studies in cooperation with universities and other higher education institutions in order to involve as many students as possible; (3) base the type and size of digester to be used on the results of the above studies; and, pending results of the studies, (4) experiment with designs better matched to current loading rates and gas requirements, less costly in the use of materials, and allowing digested sludge to be used as fertilizer; and (5) consider plans for the construction of 2-3 small demonstration units, in collaboration with other actors in the biomass program, in areas open to public examination, so that a broad audience of potential users will be reached.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","608-0159-S-00-6031-00","","3/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Renewable energy resources|Alternative energy technology|Energy research|Biomass digestion","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAT010.pdf","541 KB","","","008579 - USAID.

"Presents final report (1977-8/84) on a project to help the Government of Kenya (GOK) develop a network of secondary, minor, and farm access roads to provide isolated rural areas with access to public and private factors of production and social services. All project TA positions have been filled with qualified Kenyan staff, and the project's road construction component exceeded targets. Labor-intensive construction units built 1,532 kms (vs. a targeted 934) of rural access roads from existing tracks and right-of-ways; some 1,209 kms of these roads have been gravelled, and the remainder will be gravelled by the GOK.  The project's equipment-intensive road gravelling component was less successful, upgrading only 355 km (vs. a targeted 2,000) of secondary and minor roads, due to (1) a decision that full-length upgrading, rather than the planned spot improvements, was necessary to bring the roads to all-weather quality, and (2) work stoppages due to insufficient GOK operating funds.  Also, the original target of 30-35 kms per unit per month for the gravelling component was never met; an achievable target of 10-15 kms a month was subsequently established. Impact studies undertaken by the GOK have indicated a positive relationship between road improvement, traffic volume, and increased cash incomes. Lessons learned are:  (1) labor-intensive road construction methods can be successfully used to improve low-traffic rural roads; (2) careful scheduling of construction and gravelling activities is necessary to avoid large backlogs of ungravelled roads; (3) maintenance should begin as soon as roads are completed, and maintenance staff and equipment should be procured in advance of road completion (in this project, some roads did not receive adequate maintenance early on due to delays in recruiting staff and procuring vehicles); (4) spot improvements on earth roads were not successful, but spot improvement does provide sufficient quality upgrading on earth tracks or roads not originally built to engineered standards; and (5) during project design, the capability of the host implementing agency should be evaluated carefully in order to avoid implementation problems; e.g., in this project, chronic stoppages were initially experienced due to cash flow problems.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Access roads|Farm to market roads|Road construction","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAT047.pdf","74 KB","008565 - USAID.

"The importance of context in development management is the focus of this paper, in which the findings of six A.I.D. evaluation case studies of agricultural projects in sub-Saharan Africa are synthesized in light of other academic and field studies of the relative importance of development management and development policy. The author concludes that:  (1) management practices can constrain or expand policy effectiveness, just as policies can help or inhibit management; (2) the solution to Africa's economic crisis lies less with the importation of Western policy and management cures than with appropriate responses developed for the local context; and (3) project performance results from the interaction between management strategy and context.  Successful management strategies may have either clear, simple goals or multiple, complex ones, but they must be tailored to a project's objectives and local setting.  In particular, care must be taken to identify who stands to lose and who stands to gain from project success or failure and the risk level for each; when the stakeholders are many and the risk high, multiple and complex objectives may be necessary to deliver benefits to all affected parties.  Other key conclusions are:  (1) successful management utilizes informal practices and communication channels and benefits from flexible project design; and (2) rigorous financial controls are less important for project performance than is commonly supposed. Regarding the enhancement of indigenous management capabilities, the six projects reviewed showed that bad policies and inadequate organizational structures - not personnel deficiencies - are the main constraints.  Thus priority should be given to organization and management assistance, policy reform, and action-oriented training. The specific implications of these findings for project design, management, and evaluation as well as for future research are outlined, and it is noted that the conclusions presented here transcend agricultural projects, and are in fact especially relevant to policy reform and human resource development - both of which focus not on programs alone but on interactions between programs and their contexts.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-23-1097-00","","1/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Development administration|Agricultural development|Development project management|Management development","Kenya|Lesotho|Liberia|Niger|Senegal|Congo DR|Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL076.pdf","73 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"AID's experience with narcotics control activities has been recent, with most projects still in the implementation stage. Nevertheless, in concert with the State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics Matters and the UN Fund for Drug Abuse and Control, AID has played a significant role in U.S. efforts to control narcotics production and trade in several source countries.  This paper reviews AID's policy, field activities (summarizing those in Turkey, Pakistan, Thailand, Peru, and Bolivia), key issues in project implementation, and items of special interest in evaluating narcotics control projects. AID employs three major intervention strategies in development assistance for narcotics control:  (1) crop substitution, or, primarily, the identification and introduction of crops to replace narcotics; (2) negotiated assistance, providing development assistance to areas where local and government officials have agreed to control narcotics production; and (3) area development (believed to be most effective), to provide new income and employment opportunities for farmers adversely affected by a narcotics control project. Impediments to the control of narcotics crop cultivation through development have included:  host government inability or unwillingness to formulate long-term control programs and policies; the high profitability of narcotics crops; difficulty in reaching remote areas; faltering national economies making narcotics cultivation and trade attractive; local cultural acceptance of narcotics; and the presence of powerful trafficking organizations. It is recommended that AID:  (1) pursue multidimensional area development in narcotics-producing areas; (2) design these initiatives for the long term; (3) lend greater weight to sociocultural factors significant to narcotics trade and its eradication; (4) consider giving project management staff freedom to plan and act; (5) include in each project a separate unit to mobilize the population against narcotics cultivation and trafficking; (6) initiate and support public education in potential source nations; (7) establish linkages with local law enforcement agencies; and (8) exploit project evaluations for data collection.","Includes bibliography","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Narcotics|Illicit drug trade|Anticontraband enforcement|Development policy","Turkey|Peru|Bolivia|Pakistan|Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL054.pdf","879 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to sponsor applied contraceptive research. External evaluation covers the period 7/81-11/85 and is based on document review and interviews with project staff and researchers. The project is helping A.I.D. to meet its goal to develop better contraceptive products for LDC use.  Research subprojects are being conducted in several, high-potential areas such as: microencapsulated steroid injectables, reversible sterilization for men and women, new vaginal contraceptives, and ovulation indicators.  Specific products which appear most promising include:  90-day norethindine (NET), progesterone, and testosterone injectables; the ""SHUG"" device for reversible vasocclusion; and the plug and clip device for tubal occlusion. However, other research, conducted in less certain areas, lacks proper planning or is of questionable value.  Immunocontraception research lacks focus and cohesion (still, it is advisable to continue work in this high-risk, but also high-potential area). The potential use of anordrin is doubtful.  Percutaneous vasocclusion needs careful preclinical studies, but with the right technique could be expanded. The high performance rate needed to validate the use of iodine with the FEMCEPT nonsurgical sterilization method (blockage rates on one instillation should be over 90% for LDC applications) is difficult to attain.  There has been very little research overlap with other agencies. The project possesses the flexibility to respond to internal and external program needs.  However, more time must be spent in focusing research work by grantees and in forward planning.  This is especially important now because of the many research activities that require better technical monitoring and of the need to coordinate complex activities which have reached the product development stage. There appears to be a widening communication gap between A.I.D. and project staff.  To ameliorate this, A.I.D. should clearly communicate its priorities and concerns on paper, while the project should:  (1) hire 2 additional senior technical advisors and increase management oversight by the principal investigator; (2) give the Scientific Advisory Committee a greater role in planning and in research analysis; (3) document project priorities, plans, and budgets; and (4) establish an open, collegial relationship with other contraceptive research organizations, as has been done with the private sector.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-C-00-4063-00","","3/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Contraceptive research|Applied research","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAT063.pdf","1,951 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates OPG to Technoserve, Inc (TNS) to provide short-term business and long-term management assistance to Zairian private and development organizations and to establish a Zairian capacity to provide such services.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 11/84-2/86 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with personnel from USAID/Z, TNS, and 11 of 26 client organizations. TNS has offered valuable, appropriate, and elsewhere unavailable business assistance to 26 non-profit clients, half of which operate as cooperatives.  The BASIZ (Business Advisory Services in Zaire) program is on the whole ahead of schedule, in some instances considerably; more than twice the number of TA requests were received and investigated and service agreements concluded than were planned, overwhelmingly in agriculture.  (The 49 organizational contacts, however, were made through personal connections rather than a systematic approach to locate clients.) The bulk of services has been analyses of client problems; short-term assistance has focused on training. The Management Assistance Program (MAP) is largely on target, serving two USAID/Z agriculture projects, and TNS has recently introduced the Enterprise Facilitation Project (EFP), an elementary form of the MAP, for one cooperative. Lastly, Zairian staff development is ahead of plan on all counts, despite difficulties in finding qualified Zairian professionals; on-the-job and in-country training, individual study, and outside seminars have covered areas such as driving skills, computers, and accounting.  However, no trainer training and little management training have been provided. TNS/Z has graduated service fees by client type and ability to pay, but to date has collected fees totaling less than 2% of total program costs (vs. TNS' 1984 worldwide average of 11% and vs. TNS/Z's goal of 15% by 1990) and therefore relies on its U.S. headquarters for financial sustainability.  Clients have given TNS services generally high marks; while most clients stated that low or non-existent fees were a major reason for using TNS services, all expressed willingness to pay when their financial situation improves. However, as TNS disseminates globally-developed, standardized services, there is some concern over the degree to which assistance serves precise client needs; a second concern centers on speculation that TNS assumption of project management in the MAP creates dependency. (In addition, TNS appears to favor management development to the exclusion of clients' memberships). Lastly, TNS has failed to avoid projects undertaken for the personal benefit of leaders or by organizations whose members lack the sophistication to apply TNS solutions. Nine recomendations are provided.","Attached to PD-BBB-453","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Development organizations|Business support services|Private voluntary organizations|Beneficiary interviews","Congo DR","","","008626 - USAID.

"Management strategies used to implement six agricultural development projects in Africa and corresponding interventions for improving indigenous management capacity are herein assessed using a matrix which relates management actors (i.e., the project unit, program agency, or a unit whose management capacities are being upgraded) to five specific activities:  leadership, policy, organizational design, internal systems, and relations with the larger environment (resources and constraints). A total of 51 lessons learned are presented.  Recommended strategies for project managers are to use informal means of persuasion before formal action and to delegate management so as to provide room for leadership.  The manager should recognize tradeoffs between simple, clear project goals and more general and flexible ones and adapt goals to new information or local conditions.  To establish linkages with other governmental levels, the manager should set up a professional unit to coordinate supplies, delegate responsibilities to local managers (and provide them both logistical and informal support), and give other agency personnel a voice in planning and a stake in the results. Strategies are also suggested for personnel, financial, and information systems and for relating projects to their environment. Program agencies (i.e., in the projects examined, Ministries of Agriculture) should set up autonomous units to manage projects, establish broad and multiple goals to facilitate coordination, provide services to local units, adopt a planning/control system that decentralizes some planning functions without losing control, experiment with computerized monitoring and regular reports, approach planning as a series of steps, and channel data directly to decisionmakers. Finally, efforts to improve host institutions' capacities to design and manage development projects should analyze existing management strengths and weaknesses, anticipate how the project will affect these, design an appropriate management strategy (if enough information is available to do so), encourage managers to learn and adapt (allowing a long timeframe), and encourage the institutions to plan for long-term project sustainability.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Development project management|Management development|Development strategies|Management operations|Management methods|Agricultural development","Africa|Kenya|Lesotho|Liberia|Niger|Senegal|Congo DR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL071.pdf","121 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Evaluates Combating Childhood Communicable Diseases (CCCD) subproject in Liberia.  Mid-term external evaluation covers the period 7/83-4/86 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MHSW), USAID/L, Peace Corps, UNICEF, and WHO staff. Although much momentum has been gained during the last 6 months, the project has encountered several severe problems; implementation has been slow and uneven.  Immunization activities - which predate the project and are still, to a degree, independent of it structurally - have shown the best results. More than 300,000 vaccinations were provided during a special campaign week in 1/86.  The two other main activities -  oral rehydration therapy (ORT) and chloroquine dosing of children and pregnant women - have not yet been formally initiated.  The most serious deficiency is the GOL's inability to provide budget support due to a severe economic crisis following political and economic upheavals in 1984-85.  The GOL has also failed to implement cost recovery measures required in the project agreement and has found it necessary to institute hiring freezes and staff reductions which have resulted in inadequate numbers of personnel to manage CCCD activities; moreover, salaries are being cut and not paid on time, and the EPI has not been provided with new funds for 1985-86. Other problems have included shortages of vehicles for outreach and supervision; vaccine waste due to inadequate cold chain management and equipment; deficiencies in health education, training, and statistics; and internal inconsistencies, i.e., the field is forging ahead with ORT, malaria, and cost recovery while official guidelines are still being developed by the central bureaucracy. Continued A.I.D. support is, however, recommended for several reasons:  (1) MHSW understands the need for, and has prioritized, low-cost preventive health care, supporting CCCD to the best of its limited ability; (2) there is ample other-donor support; and (3) CCCD is developing skills and procedures which are fundamental to Liberia's proposed national primary health care (PHC) program. The most urgent needs are to:  revise the project agreement to reflect realities as regards financing and scheduling (including a 1-year extension); provide needed commodities such as refrigerators and 4-wheel drive vehicles; revise and formalize the donor contribution plan; realign available MH&SW staff for better management and supervision; formalize and disseminate a national policy on malaria; and implement registration, service and drug fees for financing of CCCD and PHC activities.","Work order no. 14","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-4062-00","","4/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|Child health care|Communicable diseases|Immunizations|Diarrhea|Oral rehydration therapy|Malaria","Liberia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAT173.pdf","16,739 KB","001275 - Westinghouse Health Systems, Inc.|002615 - John Snow Public Health Group, Inc.|000553 - Harvard University.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the Government of Zambia's (GRZ) agricultural planning and policy development capabilities. External, mid-point evaluation covers the period 9/80-3/84 and is based on document review and interviews with project and other-donor personnel. Despite a number of implementation and management problems (most notably a 2-year start-up delay due to poor US-GRZ relations), the project has begun to have an impact on agricultural policies and policymaking in Zambia.  The GRZ has instituted some significant policy changes in response to recommendations based on project studies and follow-up activities.  In instances when a policy was not changed (often for non-economic reasons), the recommendations have contributed to active policy dialogue. Long-term activities have contributed to institutional development. The participant training record is outstanding: ten of ten participants have returned to fill positions in which they have the potential to affect agricultural policy.  The capacities of local agencies have been upgraded through, e.g., enhancement of the data processing center at the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and the computer center at the Ministry of Agriculture Planning Division (MAWD/PD), development of a library in MAWD, and important work in management training and information dissemination.  An unanticipated project benefit has been the coordination of efforts among Zambian agencies, which has led to such first-time activities as a joint MAWD/CSO crop forecasting survey. Other project areas, however, have been less successful.  Some work carried out at Iowa State University, such as complex econometric model building, has not been sufficiently integrated into the Zambian context. Relations between GRZ and expatriate staff are strained for many reasons, including a heavy counterpart workload, lack of formal counterpart arrangements, and some expatriates' indifference to improving relations.  High recurrent costs for some of the institutions supported by the project is another serious problem; however, policy reforms initiated under the project have the potential to generate savings. Recommendations are made for solving management, communications, and institution-building issues during the remainder of Phase I (a 2-year extension has been approved).  Suggestions are also made for a Phase II project.  The main conclusion is that - since policy analyses and studies were perhaps relied on too much during Phase I (and were less collaborative than envisioned), and since the pace of policy reform is likely to slow somewhat - Phase II should focus on management systems and procedures, training, and institutional coordination.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural planning|Agricultural policy|Institution building","Zambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAT246.pdf","10,388 KB","008627 - USAID.

"Evaluates project in the Philippines to increase contraceptive prevalence and contraceptive use effectiveness among married couples of reproductive age.  External evaluation covers the period 8/80-1/86 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with personnel from USAID/P, the Government of the Philippines (GOP), nongovernmental agencies (NGO's), and other knowledgeable personnel. Project achievements - though reaching only about half the unrealistic targets set in the project design - are remarkable, and include an estimated annual increase of about 1% in prevalence of program methods and steady declines in the total fertility rate. Unfortunately, these accomplishments have been almost totally offset by social factors, e.g., declines in marriage age and duration of breastfeeding, and an unfavorable age structure. The project's outreach system is currently threatened by three proposed changes, each apparently motivated by cost and organizational considerations:  (1) transfering outreach costs to local governments (which would likely eliminate outreach altogether in poorer areas); (2) a cost recovery scheme whereby users of condoms and pills must pay for supplies (cost recovery should be regarded as a long-term objective); and (3) integrating population activities with health and nutrition (which would inevitably decrease the amount of time fieldworkers could devote to family planning promotion). Project administration under the Philippine Commission on Population (POPCOM), while generally competent, is encumbered by that agency's dual responsibilities.  POPCOM is responsible both for implementing project activities and for regulating and coordinating population activities in general; thus, it is often in competition with the NGO's it regulates. A related problem is that POPCOM has too much control over population research, which can lead to a misuse of POPCOM staff, bias against certain types of research, and conflicts of interest. A number of recommendations are made.  Key among these is the need to give higher priority to increasing the demand for contraception (given the fact the desired family size in the Philippines remains at four children).  This can be most effectively accomplished by highlighting the socioeconomic advantages of a lower population growth rate to GOP and local leaders. A.I.D and other donor agencies should be receptive to GOP proposals for a successor program.  In the future, A.I.D. should play a more directive (i.e., less intrusive) role.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-C-00-4063-00","","5/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Family planning promotion programs","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAT284.pdf","2,816 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates project (10/83-10/85) to build, rehabilitate, and expand potable water and sanitation systems and irrigation facilities in Bolivia in response to the 1983 drought.  Final external evaluation is based on visits to 16 affected communities and interviews with involved personnel and with beneficiaries. The project was launched primarily as an attempt to provide water to communities, and only secondarily as a long-term health intervention. Although CARE will not meet the project target for irrigation systems, and has not constructed any sanitary systems, it has been very successful in implementing potable water systems.  All told, CARE has undertaken 109 water projects (vs. a targeted 80) and 17 irrigation systems (vs. 30).  Work has been completed in 84% of the communities and should be 100% finished by the end of 11/85.  CARE's construction progress is particularly remarkable given the lack of full counterpart support and the economic crisis in Bolivia. Still, a high price has been paid for pushing the resources of CARE and its counterpart, the Departmental Development Corporations, to complete the projects on time.  Consistent and significant problems were identified in the areas of:  project conception (coverage and level of service); design and construction; training (including health and community management); and operations and maintenance practices.  These problems diminish the potential benefits to the communities and affect the medium to long-term survival of the water systems. Highest priority should be given to correcting and rehabilitating deficiencies in systems constructed under the project.

During Phase I, numerous implementation problems were experienced due to such factors as the GOM's inability to provide funding, poor contractor performance, poor site selection, and inadequate infrastructure (i.e., administration, facilities, supplies, and personnel).  The major lesson of Phase I was that a PHC program which focuses on training village health workers (VHW's) without strengthening the health infrastructure is inadequate. Phase II, designed to incorporate lessons from Phase I and to utilize remaining funds, accomplished most of its objectives. Facility renovation and construction were completed at the cercle and arrondissement levels; simple, durable, and repairable equipment was installed; administrative improvements were introduced; training and retraining of VHW's and traditional birth attendants were continued; and PHC services were strengthened throughout Koro.  The greater availability of health facilities in particular increased local confidence in the health system.  On the negative side, several problems were encountered in obtaining supplies from UNICEF. An unplanned activity was the use of $110,000 for emergency meningitis and measles vaccinations in response to drought-related refugee problems in Timbuktu and Gao Regions. Two important factors in the success of Phase II were its focus on upgrading health infrastructure and its transfer of increased responsibility for planning and management to Malian staff. There is a good possibility that the Phase II model can be replicated elsewhere in Mali, given donor support, TA, and, most important, the development of a community financing scheme.  A survey conducted in 2/85 indicated that people in Koro Cercle are willing to pay for health services and medications, and in fact, currently spend significant amounts on useless and/or dangerous treatments. This and other donor projects have proven that VHW's, though useful in certain roles, cannot meet a majority of a population's health care needs.  Their training is extremely expensive and attrition can be as high as 90% only one year after training.  A solid infrastructure, however, can reinforce VHW effectiveness and credibility. Other lessons are:  (1) an agent should be hired to procure all medical supplies to avoid delays; (2) construction should be closely monitored to discourage dishonesty, wastefulness, or carelessness.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Rural areas|Paramedical education|Community health workers|Limited data","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAT317.pdf","451 KB","008575 - USAID.

"Evaluates subproject activity to provide U.S. Master's degree training in nonformal education to mid-career professionals from the Lesotho Distance Teaching Center (LDTC) through an innovative program. External final evaluation covers the period 9/82-5/84 and is based on document review; interviews with AID/W, USAID/L, and University of Massachusetts' Center for International Education (CIE) staff; and interviews/questionnaires with former participants. The split-semester program, in which participants underwent two 4-month periods of U.S. training with an 8-month interim of independent study and normal work in Lesotho, was designed to respond to LDTC insistence on graduate education for senior staff without causing lengthy absences of these personnel.  The model showed its viability and potential for meeting participant training needs with minimum disruption to local institutional functions.  The eight participants received their M.Ed degrees and had the opportunity to apply their studies directly to their interests/work roles in the field.  Their short absences had a less negative impact on the LDTC than would have a traditional U.S. training program of 18-24 months.  While not intrinsic to the model, all eight attended the same center (CIE) which may have reinforced group cohesion and morale and helped them to apply their training. However, the program fell short of expectations and potential. Participants questioned whether their courses could have been more relevant to the specifics of their work and country.  Also, although four of the seven interviewed did not feel that their absences caused major problems for their colleagues, in fact the excessive workload did cause problems in this area and previous evaluators felt that absences for training slowed down LDTC progress considerably. While model replication is possible in numerous variations and should be considered a highly viable and cost-effective alternative to traditional graduate training programs, its relevance could be improved by:  more accurately matching training courses to participant needs; integrating independent study research with the needs of the beneficiary institution; and utilizing participants to train institution staff.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","DPE-1054-C-00-1034-00","","4/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Nonformal education|Educational facilities|Participant program administration|Masters degrees|Beneficiary interviews","Lesotho","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAT345.pdf","1,131 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"Evaluates two projects to provide U.S. graduate training in management and agricultural sciences as well as graduate and undergraduate training in engineering to Tunisian students. External evaluation covers the period through 1/86 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project and other involved personnel and beneficiaries. Both projects are outstanding successes.  More than 90% of the students complete their degree programs, many with a high level of academic excellence, especially at the undergraduate level. This may be due to the fact that the competition to become a participant is rigorous and the participants are among the best in the country. English-language training (ELT) for B.S. level participants is clearly adequate, as shown by their success in the U.S.  Particularly helpful has been the follow-up program of intensive English which all participants are required to attend when they arrive in the U.S. Efforts to foster academic linkages between Tunisia and the U.S. are still in the exploratory stages.  Initial activities such as short-term visitations, faculty exchange sabbaticals, and collaborative research projects have been useful, but follow-ups are needed to develop sustained linkages. It is recommended that:  (1) The present model of a 4-5 week intensive ELT program in Tunisia followed by a similar program in the U.S. be continued in lieu of conducting all ELT activities in Tunisia. (2) USAID/T should continue to fund the ELT program in Tunisia.  (3) Current efforts to develop person-to-person linkages be continued but broadened to include seminars and lectures by known authorities as well as summer teaching in the U.S. by Tunisian professors.  The development of school-to-school linkages should be fostered by focusing on those U.S. universities that have shown an interest in A.I.D. programming in Tunisia.  Insitutional linkages should be based on targets drafted by Tunisian councils of engineering and agricultural deans, and negotiated by Tunisian rather than contractor personnel.  To ensure that the linkages are sustained, outside sources of funding should be sought. (4) As highly capable, U.S.-trained graduates are sought not only in Tunisia, but internationally, the Government of Tunisia should rationalize the salary scales for scientific researchers and faculty members so that they are comparable.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","NEB-0150-C-00-5200-00","","1/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Graduate education|Engineering education|Science education|Management education|Undergraduate education|Participants|Agricultural education|Beneficiary interviews","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAT351.pdf","19,680 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"Evaluates project to field test schemes for financing the provision, by the Philippine Ministry of Health (MOH), of primary health care (PHC) services and to implement related research, training, and public education activities.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1983-11/85 and is based on document review, interviews with key personnel, and a site visit. Progress has been very slow:  only 1 of 8 planned special studies (SS) has been carried out, and only 3 of 21-31 planned financing schemes (FS) have been approved.  The delay in completing the SS's has delayed projected improvements in program design and policy for training PHC volunteers and supervisors and in village drug supply and herbal drug processing technology.  Only education activities and commodity procurement have been accomplished under the service delivery component, and these were mostly modifications of previous efforts. The key problems have been structural and systemic in nature, compounded by design flaws.  The absence of full-time project and component managers has been especially troublesome.  In the case of SS's, the review process is needlessly long and has failed to ensure the adequacy and appropriateness of outputs.  As for FS's, neither the project plan nor project management provided clear guidelines as to what schemes are desirable and worth supporting. Masked by these delays are potential problems regarding project funding.  The funds released to date have been much lower than programmed, and the procedures adopted for the 90-day cash advance/liquidation method are expected to create cash flow problems if project efficiency improves.  However, due to the devaluation of the peso, substantial excess peso funds are likely to be available. Key recommendations are to:  (1) centralize project management in the Office of the Minister of Health, reinforce it with full-time consultancy support, and upgrade staff support in the Secretariat at the MOH and the Philippine Council for Health R&D; (2) streamline systems and procedures for SS's and FS's; (3) review the availability of peso funding, as well as USAID/P and Government of the Philippines (GOP) fund release procedures; and (4) replan activities in order to provide more focused directions and guidelines - especially in regard to FS's - taking into account the prevailing socioeconomic situation, changing health priorities, and GOP financial constraints. Lessons learned are:  (1) well-defined systems and procedures are needed for projects that are, like this one, innovative and pioneering in nature; and (2) spreading responsibility for key activities to committees and ad hoc bodies seems to detract from efficiency.","Evaluation period: 13 Nov 1985-30 Jan 1986","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Health finance|Health research|Operations research|Alternative health delivery services|Project change","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAT415.pdf","33,354 KB","001704 - Economic Development Foundation","","008592 - USAID.

"The impacts of 2 irrigated resettlement projects in Sri Lanka which were managed by a private firm, the Ceylon Tobacco Company, Ltd. (CTC), are herein examined. Farmers in both projects look back to CTC days as a time of excellent agricultural advice and input delivery, but in other ways the projects differed widely.  In the first project, the Mahiyangana Colonization Scheme, CTC served as sole donor and manager from 1966 to 1980.  While CTC's generosity to the 59 project families transformed their lives, it also created strong physical and psychological dependency.  The result was an enormous economic and social impact on a small number of people, but not a model settlement. CTC played a lesser role in the second project, Mahaweli System H, Block 9, which at full size served 2,122 families.  In 1979, CTC took over management of agricultural inputs, extension, and marketing through an informal understanding with the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka (MASL); the latter remained responsible for water management and nonagricultural functions.  A lack of clearly defined spheres of responsibility led to misunderstandings and competition between CTC and MASL.  Also, CTC was never able to recover operating costs, even after negotiating a fee from MASL.  In 1983 both parties agreed to end the arrangement. Lessons learned are:  (1) Giving a private entity partial responsibility within a government system is a difficult task at best and must be supported by good planning documents rather than informal understandings.  (2) Great endowment breeds great dependency.  A settlement project can become self-reliant, if it sets specific limits on support (avoiding unusual and very expensive inputs), requires settlers to contribute labor and - once harvests are being marketed - money, is sparing in direct staff attention, encourages but does not direct or dominate farmer and water user organizations, and promotes a business relationship with farmers by trying to place agricultural inputs/services in private hands.  (3) Donors and agents do best what they know well.  A firm like CTC that knows one commercial crop is likely to do well in another but should not be expected to manage community development.","Preliminary ed.: PN-AAU-643","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural land settlement|Arid zone|Rural development|Colonization programs|Private sector","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL077.pdf","167 KB","000156 - USAID.

"A 20-year, AID-supported Onchocerciasis Control Program (OCP) initiated in 1974 by WHO, the World Bank, FAO, and UNDP, and currently covering portions of seven affected West African nations, is evaluated. Program results have been impressive.  In 90% of the program area, onchocerciasis transmission has been interrupted, resulting in marked decreases in the incidence of blindness, disability, and debility; some 27,000 cases of blindness have been prevented in Burkina Faso alone over the past decade.  The program's economic benefits are potentially large: an estimated 15 million ha of tillable land have been opened up in formerly endemic regions.  Additional investment is required, however, to exploit the liberated areas.  Further, although the reserves of the parasite have been reduced, the movement of people from infected into freed areas could spark a resurgence. Program experience has shown that such a program would not have achieved its level of success without the long-term financial commitment of donors at the outset.  Other lessons learned are that:  (1) complex disease control programs may require time for experimentation before they can become fully operational; (2) vertical disease control projects may play a useful role in helping to reinvigorate primary health care delivery programs; (3) undertaking development assistance programs within a multilateral framework and implementing them through established international structures can greatly facilitate success; (4) vigorous, sustained research efforts are crucial for the program's ultimate success; (5) aggregate economic and social welfare benefits are difficult to calculate precisely; (6) international support is imperative at early stages for regional disease control efforts; (7) initial high-technology control methods must be gradually replaced by low-technology methods and local capacity building; (8) highly specialized project components should be contracted out; and (9) socioeconomic development in freed lands depends on initiatives from outside the OCP organization.","French ed.: PN-AAX-202","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Onchocerciasis|Disease prevention and control","West Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL078.pdf","210 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Prompted by the disappointing record of its livestock and range management projects in Sub-Saharan Africa, A.I.D. beginning in 1979 sponsored a series of studies by the University of Wisconsin Land Tenure Center on pastoral development projects in East, West, and Southern Africa.  Those studies are herein summarized. Conventional donor policy for livestock projects in the 1960's and early 1970's is examined first.  Generally, this strategy focused on improving livestock quality and range conditions and increasing market ""offtake,"" and largely ignored the broad social, economic, and ecological environment of the pastoralists. More recent approaches have recognized the importance of these broader issues, but this alone has not guaranteed success for African pastoral systems are in a transitional stage and herders often respond in unexpected ways to incentives offered by new markets and projects. Regional differences in Africa's changing pastoral systems are next examined.  The experience of A.I.D. and World Bank projects in East Africa (Somalia, Kenya, and Tanzania) and West Africa (Mauritania, Senegal, Niger, Cameroon, and Mali) are reviewed, followed by a discussion of the evolution and outcomes to date of Botswana's Tribal Grazing Land Policy.  A variety of land tenure issues are identified and analyzed in these regional studies. The tendency of host governments and donors to overemphasize the institutional upgrading of range control and marketing agencies is noted. Concluding that some form of communal tenure will be the rule for the foreseeable future, the authors outline a tenure system that will allow small and medium producers continued participation in commercial livestock production:  (1) large, commercial producers may need exclusive rights to extensive grazing areas; (2) small and medium producers, because of their inability to capitalize private range investments, will need some kind of modified communal tenure (development thereof will often be difficult, requiring close attention during project design); and (3) small, itinerant producers present special problems best dealt with through land use zoning and promotion of mixed farming or, in some cases, off-farm employment.","Earlier version: PD-AAP-900","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Land tenure|Livestock|Agricultural policy|Range management|Communal land|Grazing land","Africa south of Sahara|Botswana|Kenya|Somalia|Mauritania|Cameroon|Niger|Senegal|East Africa|West Africa|Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL072.pdf","473 KB","001289 - University of Wisconsin at Madison.

"The effectiveness of twelve AID-assisted contraceptive social marketing (CSM) programs which were active in 1984 is reviewed in this report and characteristics affecting CSM performance are discussed. CSM sales in 1984 provided nearly 5 million couple-years of protection (CYP's) in the 12 countries and, by optimistic estimate, averted some 890,000 births (or about 2% of live births).  Four of the programs were quite successful, providing coverage to 7-15% of eligible couples.  CSM's share of the contraceptive users' market ranged from 20-50% in the more successful countries, but was considerably lower elsewhere.  The programs have been most effective in reaching urban/semiurban populations among the lower, though not the poorest, income groups; special outreach efforts can increase rural coverage, but at higher costs.  Studies suggest that CSM is more cost-effective than clinic- or community-based contraceptive distribution methods, with net operating costs for mature programs ranging from $0-$4 per CYP.  It may be unrealistic, however, to expect the programs to achieve both widespread contraceptive coverage and economic self-sufficiency, since only Colombia has succeeded in this.  Several other countries have generated enough revenue to cover all operating (though not commodity) costs. A number of elements appear to influence CSM success.  Key among these is the use of commercial-sector marketing channels, promotional techniques (e.g., mass media advertising, giveaways), market research techniques, and management models.  Most CSM programs are operated within the private sector.  Those managed totally within government structures tend to be the least successful, while management by semiautonomous agencies, which allows a host government to maintain oversight of CSM activities, has been very successful in Nepal, Bangladesh, and Egypt.  Of external factors affecting CSM, the most crucial is host-government support - most CSM programs that have failed did so because of political and/or regulatory factors.","Project title: Social marketing for change (SOMARC)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Social marketing|Commercial retail sale of contraceptives|Contraceptive prevalence","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL073.pdf","187 KB","000191 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report (8/80-3/85) on A.I.D.'s part in a multi-donor effort to reduce maternal and infant/child morbidity and mortality by expanding the Government of Burma's primary health care (PHC) program. The project (which provided less than 7% of total program contributions) was successful in:  procuring commodities (medical supplies, hospital equipment, training and health information materials), although the commodities arrived later than expected; providing appropriate TA; providing pre- and in-service training of volunteer health workers (community health workers, auxiliary midwives, traditional birth attendants); training 10 participants (all returned to Burma); and providing health worker coverage of the 147 target townships (although coverage by auxiliary midwives was only 75% of target). Although seven studies were completed, data were often suspect and analyses incomplete.  Thus, while the project did expand the PHC program, it cannot be shown that it helped reduce maternal and infant/child morbidity and mortality.  In a second key area, supervision, especially of mid-level health workers, proved, due to its infrequency and inadequacy, to be the weakest link in the project. While a follow-on project will address this problem by providing supervision training, it is imperative that decentralized monitoring, information, and evaluation systems be developed.  Also, increased emphasis should be put on the preventive aspects of health care.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Maternal child health care|Paramedical education|Health care administration|Limited data","Burma","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAT574.pdf","111 KB","008521 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report (8/82-9/85) on an OPG to World Education, Inc. (WEI) to support self-sustaining development as part of a multi-donor Integrated Rural Development Program (IRDP) in Maseno South Diocese of Western Kenya. Despite some notable achievements and the efforts of WEI and the Maseno South Diocese to implement recommendations of an 8/84 evaluation, the A.I.D. project (USAID/K was not advised in detail about what was accomplished in the project through the activities of other donors) was only a partial success.  Positively, the project developed a series of local-language educational materials on food production, water, and income generation; established 150 community development groups (10 over target); and trained 11 development assistants (4 over target).  The latter have worked effectively with the community groups, helping them to carry out successful income generation projects. However, the training of the assistants was delayed until the final year, the assistants have complained to USAID/K that they were not being used to capacity, and there is no evidence that the Diocese took responsibility for paying the assistants' salaries at project end.  Further, no loans were made from the revolving fund during the project (although the loan program is now being reorganized), and there is need to implement the system to evaluate IRDP and to tighten IRDP's management system. The project failed to achieve a key purpose - to demonstrate that the Episcopal Church in Kenya is an effective instrument for administering loan funds.  A major problem was poor management. The bishop, while well-intentioned, made many unilateral decisions and rarely consulted with others; as a result, project management was ineffective at the community level.  In addition, WEI did not have a local project manager in place (originally USAID/K did not think it necessary, and later the bishop opposed it); periodic visits from WEI's Boston headquarters proved insufficient.  There was also high turnover among senior and middle management personnel. A.I.D. should insist at the design stage on in-country project management of projects such as this.  This would ensure the presence of what this project lacked - the spending of project funds in a timely manner, the preparation and forwarding to the Mission and the PVO's home office of meaningful and accurate reports, and a rapid and effective solution to emerging problems.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Integrated rural development|Community development|Income generation","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAT660.pdf","85 KB","008565 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report (1980-5/86) on project to improve the capabilities of Thailand's Office of Agricultural Economics (OAE) in the areas of policy planning, project and budget review, and coordination and monitoring. The project helped to introduce new data collection and analysis, project management, and commodity analysis methods into economic research in agriculture.  Training is considered the most effective and important project area, benefiting over 1,000 persons.  Three participants (vs. five planned) are completing U.S. Ph.D. training, and the PACD has been extended to 6/30/87 for this activity (costing, notably, an average of $20,000 per year, outrageous for land grant universities).  In addition, 22 OAE staff received M.S. training, and 6 completed USDA technical short courses.  The project supported in-country training in the use of computers, a large number of fora for agricultural policy formulation, and attendance at international meetings. The agricultural statistics component was the most significant among the technical areas.  A system of area sampling frames (ASF) was installed in all 73 provinces, and by 10/85 in use by all OAE zone offices.  Thailand will be the first country outside the United States to begin using this advanced system, which incorporates satellite data into the ASF methodology.  Aerial photographs to complete coverage of the system's 2,000 sampling units should be ordered in 1986 when work on ASF is complete. ASF surveys were conducted for 54 provinces (the rest will be surveyed in 10/86 and after), and a 10/84 ASF rice survey of 15 provinces produced smaller sampling errors than did the previous list frame methodology.  The immediate post-project period of data collection from ASF will be critical. While accomplishments were impressive, they did not meet expectations, especially as related to policy formulation.  The project's strong policy orientation was not always vigorously pursued by the consultants and not encouraged by OAE management. A major disappointment regarding TA from Iowa State University was the recruitment of most project staff from other universities, the USDA, or USDA/AID retirees, resulting in reduced cooperation and esprit de corps with the Thai government. Lessons learned are to:  (1) avoid overselling projects in the design phase; (2) match consultants with the primary objectives to be pursued; (3) avoid unduly restrictive or ambitious terms of reference for team members, but make the contractor accountable for individual and overall performance; and (4) develop better reporting mechanisms so that reports are substantive and indicative of project performance.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural economics|Data collection|Agricultural surveys|Statistical data|Institution building|Agricultural planning|Policy making|Beneficiary count","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAT662.pdf","208 KB","008613 - USAID.

"A.I.D.'s approach to resolving recurrent project implementation problems often involves ""hard"" management changes concerned with design issues, such as locus of authority and responsibilities. This paper identifies ""soft"" management changes - those that focus on people and A.I.D.'s organizational culture - that might resolve these problems. The job performance of 25 foreign service officers with a reputation for management excellence was examined to identify those work characteristics (including quantity and quality of work; versatility; consistency; attitude; operational orientation; technical, analytic, and interpersonal skills; ability to reverse a bad situation; and soundness of judgment) which contributed to management effectiveness.  The study suggests that in rewarding excellence A.I.D. shift its emphasis from design, planning, and general administration to management activities, and that it correct its practice in promoting people of removing those with implementation skills from involvement in project management. A.I.D. should also place greater emphasis on project manageability in project design and evaluation, and confer greater recognition, visibiity, and rewards to expertise in project management.","Cover date: Feb 1986","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Development project implementation|Management aspects|Occupational qualifications|Professionals|Problem solving|Personnel management","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAV283.pdf","46 KB","003433 - USAID.

"A computer-based study of 277 mostly agricultural projects in Africa was conducted using project documentation in A.I.D.'s Development Information System.  The following project characteristics were examined:  (1) the level of organizational direction; (2) development management enhancement interventions; (3) enhancement/training components; (4) level of success; and (5) development management problems.  Key findings were: projects in Africa are still being directed from the national rather than rural level; local administrative support directly influences project success; technical assistance should be viewed as a means of increasing indigenous management capacity; formal schooling remains the primary form of training, although more management training would be beneficial; contextual, especially socioeconomic, factors were considered most important in explaining project success; and data in A.I.D.'s information system were often inconclusive as to what constitutes project success. The study's statistical findings are presented in 32 tables.

"The first step in an effort to develop an impact evaluation program for A.I.D. participant training (PT) activities, this study reviews 206 evaluations and related documents on PT over a 30-year period and from all A.I.D. geographic areas.  The study showed relatively limited PT activity during the 1970's (due in part to A.I.D.'s preoccupation with Vietnam and to the Congressional mandate to reach the ""poorest of the poor""), increasing PT activity in Africa and the Near East, and, with three notable exceptions, that the evaluation of PT has focused on operational issues rather than on PT's long-term effectiveness.  The 141 specific recommendations contained in the documentation were classified into 12 categories representing the program's major features - orientation; A.I.D. management; training design, strategy, and location; re-entry and follow-up; support services at training site; participant selection and placement; English-language training; complementary programs; and research and evaluation.

"Summarizes attached final external evaluation (XD-AAT-738-A) of a project to develop a network of agricultural research stations and experimental farms in Sumatra, Indonesia, to conduct agroclimatically appropriate food crop research.  The evaluation covered the period 1977-1/86 and was based on document review, visits to 7 research stations, and interviews with project personnel. Except for the development of experimental farms, planned activities were completed.  The Sukarami Research Institute for Food Crops (SARIF) - which was established in 1980 and assumed project responsibility from the Central Research Institute for Food Crops (CRIFC) - is on the way to becoming an effective agricultural research institute.  Its physical facilities are adequate, and with the return of the 40 personnel who are studying for advanced degrees, it will have a well-rounded staff, although a special effort will be needed to add personnel in agricultural economics and plant pathology.  On the negative side, the support unit which maintains the infrastructure and equipment for the research program continues to be SARIF's weakest element, and Government of Indonesia funds are inadequate to support both this unit and the research programs being planned for the six experimental stations directly under SARIF. TA provided to SARIF by IADS/Winrock has been successful and has contributed significantly to SARIF's development.  Continuing TA over the next 5 years in selected areas is necessary to consolidate the advances already made.  A proposed international research and training center for upland rice at Sitiung would severely strain the administrative capability of SARIF, which is still consolidating its program. The evaluation, which provided USAID/I with excellent guidelines for the 7-year project extension, recommended, inter alia, that SARIF add a Research Director and that it group related functions.  It also noted an urgent need to complete the experimental farm by the end of 1986 and to train support staff and to provide for this training in the project extension. Lessons learned are that:  (1) the training of support services staff should be given attention comparable to the training of scientists; and (2) adequate operating funds are absolutely essential for the success of any research institute.","Attached to PD-AAT-738|Loan no. 497-T-048","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Applied research|Food crops|Research organizations|Research facilities|Personnel development|Institution building|Limited data","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAT738A.pdf","1,503 KB","008558 - USAID.

"The impacts of two community-based integrated rural development projects in Burkina Faso's (formerly Upper Volta) Seguenega and Dori Departments are examined.  The projects were implemented, respectively, by Africare and Save The Children Federation (SCF). Both PVO's worked with village groups, helping them to organize and carry out self-help development activities.  Africare integrated its personnel with those of a provincial office to form a project unit which worked independently of both USAID/BF and the central government. Africare followed A.I.D. programming practices and by project end had achieved most planned outputs relating to organization of village groups, agriculture, health care, road-building, and literacy. Provision of initial funding for credit and well digging were key ingredients in the project's success. The Dori project began as a pilot activity; when A.I.D. decided not to fund a continuation (due to SCF's failure to meet programming requirements), SCF continued the project on its own, with a somewhat trimmer focus.  Although villagers in Dori, unlike those in Seguenega, lacked a tradition of group action, SCF succeeded (to a lesser extent than Africare), in sensitizing villagers to self-help activities, enhancing the local government's development capacity, and increasing local technical knowledge. The project's physical accomplishments are harder to assess because specific targets were not set. Experience shows that integrated rural development is a management-intensive activity.  Lessons learned include:  (1) expect a slow start-up and plan at least 8-10 years of inputs; (2) select an area with some tradition of community action; (3) choose activities that do not conflict with local customs and start with activities that villagers have already found profitable; (4) select a capable PVO and ensure that sufficient government resources will be provided, then leave responsibility for implementation with the local government and PVO; (5) integrate horizontally to achieve greater impact from mutually reinforcing activities, vertically to achieve sustainability; and (6) for financial sustainability, include credit rollover arrangements, build up the village's financial resources, and develop management skills.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Community development|Integrated rural development|Community self help|Beneficiary interviews","Burkina Faso","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL080.pdf","232 KB","000156 - USAID.

"In order to define and assess the project mechanisms through which A.I.D. provides participant training, a descriptive analysis of 107 AID-supported projects was conducted; findings are provided in this paper.  Three categories of projects (training only, multi-input projects with a training element, and centrally-funded projects) are defined, and within these, nine training modes (e.g., scholarships, university support, or U.S.-focused) are identified.  Evaluative summaries of the training modes are presented, with particular attention given to their respective strengths and weaknesses, followed by findings on 10 general issues of interest to USAID personnel responsible for participant training:  English-language ability, candidate availability, training utilization, attrition, women's participation, selection, participant placement, location of training, program extensions and successive degrees, and degree equivalency.  Two recommendations are given for improving the evaluation of participant training, and thus gaining evidence of the benefits from investment in training programs.","Earlier, comprehensive ed.: PN-ABI-719","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Participants|Participant program administration|Limited data plus","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAV430.pdf","1,019 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Guidelines for planning baseline and follow-up surveys to evaluate the socioeconomic impact of rural road projects are presented.  Four steps in planning the surveys are discussed: (1) identifying the project's most likely and/or important socioeconomic impacts (both direct and derived, the latter of which emerge after some time and may be better addressed through later impact evaluations); (2) specifying data requirements to measure these impacts; (3) selecting an appropriate study approach, in most cases based principally on funds available for evaluation (three general approaches - minimum, low cost, and high cost - are compared in a table); and (4) writing a scope of work based on the decisions made concerning the impacts to be evaluated, data requirements, and study approach.  A concluding section cautions that, where baseline data are inadequate or unusable or where host country support for data collection has waned, it is prudent to evaluate the usefulness of a follow-up survey before wasting valuable energy and resources.

"Presents external final evaluation of a 1979-86 project to establish an institutional capability in the Somali Water Development Agency (WDA) to plan and carry out ground and surface water development projects in rural areas.  No methodology is indicated. Results were mixed in this project, in which USAID/S and WDA perceptions of what was needed seem to have diverged considerably.  The Project Paper focused on upgrading WDA's professional capabilities (although 130 WDA staff members were trained, few improvements were made in WDA's institutional capacity) and on acquiring new equipment for providing water to two integrated agricultural development projects. WDA probably wanted a program of equipment rehabilitation, standardization, maintenance, and material support.  WDA preferences were accepted in one key area, however - the acceptance of 8"" casing and screen for all wells and the later selection of a highly sophisticated drilling rig ill suited to 8"" casing.  This mismatch, which was noted both by the contractors and by two evaluation teams, was a major factor in the unreasonably high cost of the wells.  A program proposed by one of the contractors to rehabilitate wells using private contractors would have been far less costly. On the positive side, benefits to the 100,000 people in the communities where wells were completed were real and included increases in water quality and in access to water; freeing of time (especially women's) for more productive work; reduced livestock losses; stabilization of agro-pastoral and sedentary populations, resulting in increased food production; and increased government ability to provide social services.  Recent changes in the two top positions at WDA make it possible to be even more optimistic about the project's continuing benefits. Nonetheless, several areas of concern remain.  The ability of WDA's regional offices to maintain and repair the wells is marginal at best. The project did not address this issue. Particularly worrisome is the increase in village populations resulting from the practice of building wells with large production capabilities.  Well failure could result in severe dislocation.  Also, the fact that no one seems to know what becomes of villagers' water fees is having a very corrosive effect on WDA-villager relationships.  Other troublesome issues are whether WDA is able to maintain project-funded equipment and vehicles and whether it recognizes the need to collect socioeconomic, geohydrological, and equipment data systematically. Recommendations are provided for future groundwater projects in general and for follow-on work in the present project in particular.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Water resources|Groundwater|Drilled wells|Institution building|Government departments|Equipment|Costs|Livestock|Water supply structure maintenance|Equipment maintenance|Data collection|Population density|User fees|Technical training|Rural areas|Project sustainability|Beneficiary count","Somalia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAT911.pdf","5,622 KB","001135 - Tippetts-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton","","008604 - USAID.

"Presents final external evaluation of project to construct a family health center (FHC) and expand family planning (FP) services in Togo. Evaluation covers the period 10/83-12/85 and is based on document review and visits to 7 clinics. The FHC was completed by 7/82 (not 1/80, as planned) and equipped by 7/83.  Family Planning International Assistance (FPIA) has developed curricula for physicians, midwives, nurses, and social workers and trained 121 Ministry of Health (MOH) personnel in these categories; another 85 persons will be trained before the FPIA grant expires in 11/86, still far below target.  Course content and methods seem appropriate, although facilitators need training to improve their use of interactive teaching methods and broaden their understanding of FP. There is a general lack of audiovisual aids and support materials, and the library is little used by the facilitators due to a paucity of French materials and ""how-to"" materials. The MOH has designated 11 facilities (4 in Lome, the remainder up-country) as FP centers; there have been 1,992 contraceptive acceptors at these centers.  The Association Togolaise pour le Bien-Entre Familial (ATBEF), which also offers FP services at its private clinic, provides contraceptives to the FP facilities and to other MOH centers.  Thus, FP services are available - if not through the project - in all 21 MOH districts.  ATBEF statistics show that about 2% of Togolese women of child-bearing age use modern methods.  (The project design projected 10% prevalence within 5 years of FHC's full operation.)  As demand for FP services is expected to increase, regular inservice training for health workers is recommended. Medical supervision at FP facilities is adequate, but no supply management system exists; reliance on ATBEF has led to periodic stockouts of contraceptives, especially of spermicides, the preferred method.  (IUD's and condoms are also used, but the pill is used by very few and diaphragms not at all.) The project has not provided sex education materials to schools or engaged in FP promotion, the latter due to a lack of trained personnel (since contraceptive use in Togo requires the husband's permission, male promoters are especially needed). The project needs a plan to guarantee FP delivery in existing and future centers; included should be a system for collecting statistics (which currently depends on irregular vists by project staff) and for effective use of administrative staff.  The project manager and the rest of the staff would benefit from management training.  Also, FPIA has not transferred funds in a timely manner or provided sufficient technical and managerial assistance.  It may be necessary to explore alternative sources of assistance.","Attached to PD-AAT-930","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Family health care|Health facilities|Family planning clinics|Family planning services|Medical education|Limited data plus","Togo","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAT930A.pdf","2,850 KB","008614 - USAID.

"Managerial and organizational problems seriously undermine the implementation of development programs and projects in all developing countries, but particularly so in Africa.  This paper reviews and analyzes management experience in six A.I.D. agricultural and rural development projects in Africa.  Section 1 examines the scope and seriousness of development management problems faced by public and private organizations in implementing projects, and describes procedures for evaluating experience in Africa.  Section 2 presents a conceptual framework for evaluating development management; the framework identifies four factors which affect management - policy, design, contextual factors, and internal management (the latter including organizational structure, administrative procedures and practices, resource inputs management, and human resources management).  The framework is then used, in Sections 3-5, to order findings from evaluations of the six African projects.  The lessons learned from the projects and their implications for enhancing development management are summarized in Section 6.  A major lesson learned is that projects are affected by numerous factors which vary from country to country; therefore a practical strategy for project managers is to determine how their projects differ from others and decide which management strategies that worked effectively in another country or project may be appropriate for their projects.

"Presents final evaluation (5/83-5/86) of a two-part Housing Guaranty (HG) project to help the Government of El Salvador (GOES) upgrade shelter in marginal communities; evaluation is based in part on interviews. Flawed assumptions and inadequate institutional analysis in the Project Paper (co-authored by the evaluator) led to unrealistic targets which were in fact not met.  The HG built and financed shelter products for only 6,023 low-income people (25% below target), disbursement took 6 years and not 18 months as planned, and sites and services projects replaced the planned home improvements.  Still, the HG met two of its three institutional goals - it redirected resources to the poor and expanded low-cost housing services in secondary cities.  Interest rates, however, were not rationalized.  The parastatal Fondo Social Para La Vivienda (FSV), which lends to the poor at 4-6%, was allowed to enter the HG in 4/86 to speed disbursement of remaining funds, even though its rates undercut those of other institutions (and even though the GOES originally borrowed HG funds at 14%). Overall, interest rates have ranged from 4-6% to 12%. The project's main problem was the technical inability of its implementing agencies.  The Urban Housing Institute (IVU) takes 2-3 years to design and implement reasonable housing projects and is unable to prepare the budgets, work plans, etc., required by A.I.D. (a coordinating unit had to be formed within IVU to do its HG work). Totally dependent on the GOES for funds, IVU is disorganized, wholly lacking in management stability, rife with corruption.  It remained in the HG only because it is the one housing institution with an interest rate (12%) approaching commercial levels.  CASA, a savings and loan association and another major implementor, borrowed HG funds for two projects. In one, CASA could marshal eligible mortgages for only two-thirds of the funds it had borrowed (other buyers apparently obtained loans from FSV).  The other project was not completed due to guerilla activity, the proximity of illegal communities offering cheaper land, and unexpectedly high sewerage costs. Disbursement was also delayed by the lengthy GOES budgetary process and the frequency with which the GOES went into arrears, automatically freezing the transfer of HG funds. The HG program should continue in El Salvador - if only to remind the GOES of the cost associated with foreign aid.  It is recommended, however, that Economic Support Funds be used to provide the advances needed by implementing agencies in this institutionally unstable country; this would also help lower interest rates.  Also recommended is the formation of project units (to be managed by expatriate advisors) in each implementing agency.","Attached to PD-AAU-023","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Housing investment guaranty|Low cost housing|Government departments|Housing finance|Housing administration|Interest rates|Urban areas|Limited data","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAU023A.pdf","1,175 KB","004176 - United States League of Savings Institutions","","008540 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to support agricultural development in Haiti. Midterm evaluation covers the period 7/83-5/86 and is based on review of existing data and on site visits. The project, which for political reasons has been made independent of its original home in the Faculty of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine, has a bright future if needed mid-course corrections are made. Achievements include designing (and testing at the departmental level) an agricultural information system based on a national agricultural statistics survey (NASS) and establishing a potentially valuable comprehensive resource inventory and evaluation system (CRIES), although CRIES is so new and complex that a systematic campaign is needed to mobilize its potential for future users.  More importantly, farming systems research and extension (FSR&E), despite two major successes, has focused exclusively on on-farm, agronomic testing and has lacked input from project socioeconomists (who were placed in a separate unit).  As a result, the project has not fully characterized farming systems within zones nor identified farmer problems and constraints.  Further, extension efforts have not yet studied rural institutions and their effect on technology adoption. The NASS, an ambitious effort, lacks the expertise needed to assure quality data.  Initial efforts have suffered from serious technical flaws.  The questionnaire is written in the wrong language (French), is overcrowded, at times conceptually unclear, and demands excessive interviewer training.  Pretests have been inadequate, and data verification is nowhere attempted.  No indepth, topical surveys - needed to verify the range of responses and as an aid in data interpretation - are planned. Until these defects are remedied, work on the NASS should be halted; the project is in a privileged position to carry out smaller surveys with more direct bearing on FSR&E. Four major lessons were learned.  (1) FSR is effective only when interdisciplinary.  The project's attempt to complement on-farm agronomic testing with a separate, city-based socioeconomic survey was fundamentally flawed and largely failed.  (2) The choice of four different zones in two geographically distant regions made it very difficult to establish interdisciplinary local FSR teams.  (3) Lack of a full-time administrator can distract the TA team leader from primary tasks.  (4) The project has let quantitative work dominate most of its socioeconomic analysis, to the neglect of the more comprehensive analysis needed for FSR&E.  This resulted from the unwise attempt to build two entirely different tasks - data collection and FSR&E - into one project.  Such an attempt should not be repeated. For USAID/H's response to the evaluation, see the abstract of PD-AAU-024.","Attached to PD-AAU-024","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural development|Agricultural production|CRIES|Farming systems research|Agricultural extension|Agricultural surveys|Project change","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAU024A.pdf","10,118 KB","000490 - University of Florida.

"Evaluates project co-sponsored with the French Aid and Cooperation Fund (FAC) to combat childhood communicable diseases in the Congo via an Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) and oral rehydration therapy (ORT) and malaria control programs. External evaluation covers the period 5/84-4/86 and is based on document review, meetings with key personnel, and site visits. Project achievements include:  (1) the availability of ORT and vaccinations in almost all of the fixed maternal/child health centers in Brazzaville, Pointe-Noire, and Loubomo; (2) an increase in the percentage of children under 1 receiving all vaccinations and a subsequent reduction in the number of pertussis and polio cases; and (3) collection of baseline data for use in project development.  Project personnel are competent and enthusiastic.  On the negative side are the slow start of the malaria control program (which will probably prove the project's most recalcitrant aspect) and of health education efforts; the sometime inadequacy of vaccination techniques (using the same needle for many children); the need to improve quality control in procuring and distributing medical supplies; and a serious delay in implementing in-country training due to the unavailability of short-term TA, financial restrictions, and the lack of a training coordinator. Major problems are two.  The first, severely threatening project sustainability, is the economic crisis which makes it doubtful that Government of the Congo (GOC) will be able to make any 1986 contribution to the project, much less assume full fiscal responsibility by 5/88. From the start, GOC contributions have been lower than called for, and in response both FAC and A.I.D. have reduced their funding.  A.I.D., in fact, has frozen its funds as of 1/86.  A project extension and self-financing through user fees are key recommendations.  In any event, project achievements to date warrant continued support from the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MHSA), despite the drastic GOC cutbacks in its operating budget. The second major problem is the lack of a coordinated management structure.  For example, MHSA's National Primary Health Care Program, created in 1985, has operated in separation from the Direction of Preventive Medicine, the MHSA office overseeing the project.  Greater central-level supervision of regional and district personnel is also needed.  These problems (magnified by the lack of national EPI, ORT, and malaria policies) are exemplified in less than successful attempts to vaccinate children in Pointe Noire and Loumobo against measles.

"Presents final Mission report on a 1978-85 project to increase the ability of the University College of Swaziland's (UCOS) Department of Extra-Mural Studies (DEMS) to provide mid-level training. The project fell far short of its grandiose aims.  Inservice diploma courses in adult education and management were discontinued due, respectively, to low enrollment and staffing problems, while the provision of academic tutorial assistance to UCOS extension courses in business and education has been halted by a lack of demand which has forced DEMS to shift its focus from mature students to school leavers who probably should be taking trade and technical courses instead.  The objective to have UCOS student volunteers promote development by teaching academically certified adult education courses in rural areas was ill-conceived.  It was unlikely that students could provide such training or that, as first generation students in a university based on the British academic system, they would be willing to return to their roots in order to effect beneficial change there. The Project Paper never even addressed the inappropriateness of mounting sophisticated programs for rural people.  Finally, while a student hostel, classrooms, and block of offices were built as planned, the facilities are being used for UCOS rather than DEMS purposes, as there was little demand from DEMS for their use (as noted as early as the 6/80 PES). Perhaps DEMS' greatest accomplishment was its preparation, in compliance with a candid assessment by the National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration, of a Five-Year Plan focused on providing management training to small, rural enterprises rather than, as in the past, to larger private sector firms and parastatals.  USAID/S has already received positive feedback on this shift in DEMS' program emphasis. The project suffered from several design and implementation flaws. Originally designed to serve Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland, the project was developed at a time when the triad of universities in these three countries was beginning to dissolve. Further, DEMS was headed by a non-Swazi, although the nature of its work almost demands Swazi leadership.  Only one U.S. institution (the University of Massachusetts) responded to the 4/79 RFP and its performance was below par almost from the start. Also, a new Work Plan should have been devised after the 6/82 PES; U.S. Masters programs for the three participants were inadequately planned; and the lack of U.S. technical advisors (despite the contract with a U.S. institution) directly affected the USAID/S-DEMS relationship and the degree of commitment USAID/S was able to extract from the advisors.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Educational development|Educational extension programs|Universities and colleges|Teacher education|Adult education|Management training|Rural development","Swaziland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBC954.pdf","205 KB","008609 - USAID.

"Evaluates CARE project to improve nutrition among preschoolers in the Congo by providing nutrition and health education training, materials, and commodities, and by conducting research and evaluation.  Special evaluation covers the year 1985 (the first of the project's 3 years and the year to which A.I.D. funding was limited) and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project and Government of Congo (GOC) personnel. The training and materials development components are ahead of schedule and have expanded into new areas.  The project has established a broad base of well-trained health workers, training 315 animateurs in malnutrition and 415 health agents in the use of growth charts.  It has also produced teaching manuals and curricula, posters, flipcharts, radio programs, songs, and an updated growth chart; ordered maternal/child health clinic supplies; and, due to the inadequacy of the supervisors chosen during Phase I (1980-83), begun training the supervisors of the animateurs. and nutritional status surveys have not been performed, but a scientifically rigorous study by an outside research team is planned for 1986.  It will be used for long-term assessment and a as a model for evaluation. Despite much collaboration with GOC institutions, the project remains a free-standing organization with no significant sustaining support expect through the CARE project staff.  It is seeking to integrate its nutritional messages and programs into the curricula of schools for health workers and eventually into the existing health infrastructure. This integration is essential for the long-term sustainability of the project, which as it is is much too costly and lacks adequate top-level GOC support. Three lessons were learned.  (1) To be accepted, health messages must be specifically targeted, clear, limited in number, and delivered through several media.  They must also be discussed and debated with the target audience so that underlying misconceptions and resistance may be aired.  Educational materials must be extensively field-tested and revised.  (2) Supervisors can be effective only if they have access to their employees (animateurs), have authority over them, and are trained in the work that the employees perform.  (3) Training programs requiring significant travel by either trainers or trainees are not cost-effective.  A structure is needed to enable local supervisors to train animateurs at their place of work. There should be minimal travel and supervision by central staff.","Attached to PD-BBD-224","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Child nutrition|Nutrition education|Paramedical education|Educational materials","Congo PR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDBBD224A.pdf","2,250 KB","008626 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to institutionalize the Centre National de Coordination de la Formation (CENACOF) as a development training center in Zaire.  Mid-term threshold evaluation covers the period through 5/86 and is based on a thorough document review and interviews with concerned personnel. The project is about a year behind in realizing outputs planned in the 8/85 revision, which extended the project from 4 to 7 years.  The Executive Management Committee (EMC) has been established, but is not operating effectively.  CENACOF has developed a core of 5 qualified trainers and has a growing reputation as a training institute, but needs more trainers who will also participate in research, evaluation, and consultancies, as well as an increased Zairian cadre of subject matter specialists. CENACOF's future legal status is still in doubt, and should be settled as soon as possible. The program to train 250 Government of Zaire (GOZ) trainers and 950 development managers is increasingly effective and should be completed by the end of the project.  However, there is no evidence that the training of trainers is having a multiplier effect, that CENACOF has helped GOZ technical departments or other development organizations develop their own training services, or that the 3-week seminar for Training of Trainers in Management provides sufficient training.  The question of the marketing of CENACOF services urgently requires attention.  Also, CENACOF still needs to coordinate Zairian training programs and to develop a systematic training plan for its own staff. Construction of a training center, which was to have begun in 7/85 and which will be financed through counterpart funds (limited to $1 million equivalent), has been delayed by USAID/Z's doubts about CENACOF's management and organizational ability. (CENACOF-USAID/Z relations have in general been strained.)  No progress has been made on the planned development data base. Experiential methods used in the U.S. Department of Agriculture/CENACOF seminars have been well received and in the long term can significantly improve development project management.  However, since this improvement depends on the organizational climate to which the trainee returns, CENACOF should give more attention to organizational training and development both in structuring its training program and in carrying out needs assessments and research. The availability of GOZ financial support (out of P.L. 480 counterpart funds) will be crucial during the next few years as CENACOF endeavors to build its client base and increase user fees.","Attached to PD-BBD-110","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Training centers|Institution building|Teacher training|Management training|Development administration","Congo DR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDBBD110A.pdf","2,587 KB","006434 - Devres, Inc.","","008626 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report on a Phase I (1/80-9/85) of a project to develop a Liberian agricultural research (AR) system capable of conducting adaptive and applied research on food and cash crops, cooperating with extension service and other agencies in developing food production technology, and establishing linkages with regional and international AR institutions. Despite a late start due to the 1980 coup (which led to two project extensions) and associated difficulties in recruiting the Louisiana State University (LSU) TA team, the project succeeded in transforming the moribund Central Agricultural Experiment Station into a semi-autonomous Central AR Institute (CARI) conducting research in crop, animal, and soil science.  LSU provided roughly the planned level of TA (mostly long-term) and 70% of planned participant training was provided; shortfall in the latter was due to the unavailability of qualified candidates for long-term training and lack of Government of Liberia travel funds for short-term trainees, although the level of counterpart funding exceeded that anticipated.  Training included M.Sc. and Ph.D. training for 11 CARI staff, 7 of whom will complete their studies under Phase II.  The project also equipped CARI laboratories and a field service unit, greatly expanded the research library, developed CARI administrative systems, and helped CARI develop working relationships with AR institutes. On the negative side, the project remains very weak in getting research results to the field.  While CARI staff participated as resource people for extensionist training programs, the planned formal training program and extension publication series did not materialize. The extension advisor was not replaced after the original extensionist's tour expired, counterparts were in overseas training during most of the project, and a draft extension plan was not implemented due to a change of the Minister of Agriculture. Important progress has been made in many project areas, although the conditions expected for end-of-project are more applicable to the full 15-year project than to this initial 5-year phase. Efforts during Phase II (the first year of which overlapped with the last year of Phase I) will focus on continued recruitment and training of high quality research scientists, focusing on rice, cassava, and legume research.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Research centers|Agricultural research|Agricultural extension|Applied research|Cash crops|Food crops|Personnel development|Research equipment|Participants","Liberia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBD173.pdf","286 KB","008570 - USAID.

"Presents external final evaluation of a 1980-88 project to upgrade the Honduran health care system.  The evaluation, which was conducted early to ensure continuity with a proposed follow-on project, is based on document review, discussions with project and other concerned personnel, and site visits. Honduran health status has improved over the life of the project, as evidenced by a decline in morbidity from immuno-preventable diseases and also, probably, in malaria incidence.  The Ministry of Health (MOH) has substantially expanded coverage and improved services in its priority programs, which are consistent with the international child survival strategy. The project has achieved its primary and still appropriate target of improving MOH administrative support and management systems, by, inter alia, establishing a cold chain maintenance system and - through creation of a special MOH commission which resulted in the project's chief cost-saving effort - a system to procure and deliver medical supplies.  The MOH is paying greater attention, mainly at the central level, to management operations and has begun to develop information systems for several of them. Efforts to train MOH personnel and to upgrade the MOH supply system have improved health care at the regional, health center, and - through the training of community health workers by project-trained personnel - community levels and have also improved area-to-health center supervision.  Project-supported promotional campaigns have increased awareness of health services and appropriate treatment. The project's wide-ranging and complex nature has given it wide latitude in choosing targets of opportunity and in continuing to work in the face of obstacles.  This very latitude, however, has resulted in a failure to follow through on some basic elements, e.g., developing an adequate storage capacity and basic information systems, and ensuring supervisory follow-up between levels of service and management.  A lag in cost recovery also seems due in part to the project's complexity. Management-oriented projects such as this require a high level of administrative oversight in order to ensure that the workload does not exceed managerial capacity. Assuming a gradual decline in A.I.D. funding, the project's financial sustainability is questionable.  The high level of official commitment to project goals and objectives seems to be offset by recent financial commitments to physicians (via the Estatuto Medico) and by rising hospital costs.  Finally, major construction is not within the present capacity of the MOH - barely 5% of A.I.D. funds allotted for construction were spent.","Work order no. 81|Companion project evaluation summary: PD-AAX-075","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-4064-00","","8/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Health delivery|Health care administration|Logistics|Institution building|National level|Government departments|Project sustainability","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU066.pdf","5,070 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","008555 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase access to markets by farmers in Zaire's central Bandundu region by upgrading the road and river transportation network.  Initial evaluation, which precedes the arrival of the TA team, covers the period 6/84-2/86 is based on site visits and discussions with personnel from USAID/Z, the Office des Routes, and other recipient organizations. Implementation has begun in a timely fashion, despite a delay in establishing the Project Management and Monitoring Unit (PMMU). USAID/Z has arranged for the procurement of commodities and short-term TA and has begun to work on a number of project components, particularly water transport.  Good office space has been located and renovated for the PMMU.  The project has shown that design should be an on-going activity in projects such as this, given its experimental nature and the changing governmental and private sector environment.  Also, special provisions such as short-term TA and equipment must be built into the project in order to develop a capacity in host country research institutions to participate in monitoring and evaluation. On the negative side, liaison between USAID/Z staff responsible for projects in the Bandundu area (for instance, with the complementary Area Food and Market Development project - 6600102) could be strengthened. Lessons learned are that:  (1) the use of Mission implementation is a sure way of maintaining design momentum, especially where the Mission must rely on outside services, but should be resisted as first priority in the period before contractor arrival must be given to obtaining TA and commodities; and (2) the time necessary to field the TA team could be reduced in some cases if, as suggested in A.I.D. Handbook 3, the design team drafted a PIO/T and the project officer were involved in preparing the PP and PIO/T. Recommendations for project management and USAID/Z and/or PMMU follow-up are reflected in action decisions (see abstract for PD-AAT-424); recommendations offered for PMMU guidance - once it is established - can be found in the body of the report.","Attached to PD-AAT-424","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Development project implementation|Regional development|Transportation infrastructure|Water transportation|Farm to market roads|Limited data plus","Congo DR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAT424A.pdf","2,662 KB","008626 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the Government of El Salvador (GOES) restore the flow of pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, and equipment through its health care network and to strengthen the management and supply systems required to support the commodity flow.  External evaluation covers the period 1983-2/86 and is based on extensive interviews with USAID/ES and GOES personnel. The project is getting back on track despite early implementation problems.  A hurried project design, poor procurement planning, inadequate staffing, and serious communication breakdowns resulted in damaging project delays.  During 1985, however, USAID/ES made impressive efforts to compensate for past inadequacies.  As a result, a total of $12 million of U.S. pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, and equipment have now been delivered to El Salvador. Areas of concern remain, however.  The project's procurement strategy and supply distribution systems are uncertain and will require close monitoring by USAID/ES over the remaining months of the project. USAID/ES project staff needs reinforcement to accomplish this task.  It is recommended that a special committee be formed drawing on all offices within USAID/ES.  With help from the AID/ROCAP commodity specialist, the committee should devise a final procurement strategy for the $15.5 million commodity pipeline and accelerate action on such deferred components as the management information systems and the drug quality lab.  Also, USAID/ES should consider hosting a weekend retreat in 6/86 to improve communications among Ministry of Health officials, the Executive Management Group, the TA team, and the new A.I.D. project manager. Some important lessons have been learned.  (1) A.I.D. should plan carefully its ""changing-of-the-guard"" at overseas Missions.  Had there been a less abrupt transition of senior management in the summer of 1984, critically needed pharmaceuticals might have arrived several months earlier.  (2) Better technical review is needed during project design.  Had procurement issues been more carefully examined, project staff would not have spent much of the first year working out a procurement plan.  (3) Congress should be made aware in a timely fashion of major changes in projects in which it has signaled special interest. A.I.D.'s failure in this regard created a climate of mistrust which led eventually to a Congressional hold on project disbursements.  The hold, which soon outlived its usefulness, slowed commodity deliveries.","Cover date: May 1986","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5927-C-00-3083-00","","9/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Procurement|Health care administration|Supply management|Pharmaceuticals|Medical equipment|Limited data plus","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU098.pdf","715 KB","000750 - Management Sciences for Health (MSH)","","000186 - USAID.

"An emergency food aid program of A.I.D. and other donors helped the Government of Mali (GOM) combat the 1984-85 drought, the worst on record in that food-deficit, drought-prone country. This evaluation, based on document review and interviews, provides findings and recommendations in key areas of the program, to which A.I.D. allocated 95 MT's of emergency food (worth $46 million), about half of the program total. Poor timing reduced program impact and cost-effectiveness. A 6-month delay in the arrival of emergency food at port - a problem compounded by lack of contingency planning - led to shortfalls in the emergency food available in the period (March-June) before the rains and again early in the July-August rainy season. USAID/M devised an effective food distribution strategy, which consisted of:  using the well-established mechanisms of the Mali Grain Marketing Board (OPAM) to distribute food supplies in urban areas (where they were augmented by monetization of Title II foodgrain); using indigenous private voluntary organizations to manage free distribution in rural areas; and promoting close donor cooperation with the GOM. This strategy overcame the serious deficiencies of prior programs in distributing food to isolated rural communities and worked to succor some 2 million people.  Distribution was well targeted, rations were appropriate and sufficient, and losses and misuse of food were small. However, an inadequate needs assessment led both the GOM and donors to underestimate the need for emergency food in rural areas by at least 50%.  Also, while donor coordination was strong at the national level (despite strained GOM and USAID/M resources), local-level planning was largely ad hoc and uncoordinated.  Even so, the program was decisive in averting massive rural famine and exodus.  USAID/M also helped establish an effective system of cholera control and treatment and financed important studies to assess Mali's overall drought situation and its 1985-86 agricultural situation. The report, which includes general recommendations to relate emergency food programs in Mali more closely to national food strategies, including rehabilitation and development, includes 8 tables, 5 figures, and several detailed annexes.","Cover title: Evaluation of the African emergency food assistance|program, 1984-1985 : Mali|Later ed.: PN-AAL-092","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-05-4162-00","","","","Emergency food distribution|Drought|Famine|Disaster preparedness|Urban areas|Rural areas|Beneficiary count","","","","006434 - Devres, Inc.","","002672 - USAID.

"A.I.D. and other donors mounted a massive emergency effort to feed the 1.5 million Chadians affected by the 1984-85 drought. Despite its shortcomings, the program was a success, according to this evaluation. Based on secondary sources review and interviews and observations in Washington, D.C. and in the field, the evaluation presents detailed findings, conclusions, and recommendations in five key areas. The management strategy of using the World Food Programme (WFP) and private voluntary organizations (PVO's), supported by a network of action committees under the Government of Chad (GOC), as the main implementing agencies proved very successful.  Fuller and earlier delegation by AID/W to USAID/C of contracting responsibility would have helped avoid delays. Due to a lack of early warning, emergency preparedness, and contingency plans, available amounts of emergency food were insufficient in late 1984 and early 1985, diluting program effectiveness. Chad's weak transportation and logistical systems - compounded by political problems - proved major obstacles. Still, the program saved many lives, especially among the 46% of the needy who received food in targeted programs of the WFP and PVO's rather than through general distribution.  Resettlement programs successfully limited the creation of spontaneous camps; some of those resettled were taught productive agricultural techniques. The GOC depended heavily on donors and PVO's to define the health and nutritional impacts of the famine; PVO's in particular did an excellent job of identifying geographical areas for emergency food distribution. However, lack of infrastructure greatly inhibited health efforts. Vitamin A deficiency was neither assessed nor treated, nor was oral rehydration therapy used extensively. The 1985-86 transition from emergency relief to development, spearheaded by prompt GOC action and strong PVO and donor support and facilitated by mechanisms such as Food for Work and resettlement, has gotten off to a fast start.  The transition needs, however, to account for persons still at risk and to develop a strategy in case the drought recurs in 1986. Included are 10 general recommendations, 22 tables, 8 figures, and several detailed appendices.","Cover title: Evaluation of the African emergency food assistance|program, 1984-85 : Chad|Related document: PN-AAL-091","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-05-4162-00","","","","Emergency food distribution|Drought|Famine early warning systems|Development program implementation|Disaster relief|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","","","","006434 - Devres, Inc.","","002672 - USAID.

"Four types of data commonly needed to monitor and evaluate A.I.D. policy reform (PR) programs - data on host country compliance with disbursement conditions, on the performance of public sector institutions, on the program's economic and political context, and on the private sector's response to PR - are discussed.  Also identified are three features of PR programs which delimit their information requirements:  (1) basic information needs for monitoring implementation are defined in disbursement conditions; (2) information requirements increase as restrictions on the use of funds become more specific; and (3) the difficulty in demonstrating the macroeconomic and sectoral effects of PR's, which frequently precludes this as an evaluation strategy, may lessen information needs.  Several recommendations concerning staffing and funding for the information component are made. The report, directed to A.I.D. and host country program staff and to specialists with limited experience in the information requirements of PR programs, cites programs in Niger and Mali to exemplify both the types of data needed and the methods used to collect them.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Development program planning|Development program evaluation|Policy reform|Government policy|Management information systems","Mali|Niger","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAV806.pdf","54 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Evaluates project component to help the Barbados Institute of Management and Productivity (BIMAP) provide training and TA to private enterprises in Eastern Caribbean states.  Midterm evaluation covers the period 6/83-10/85 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with trainees, businesspersons, and project personnel. Although BIMAP has provided valuable, practical consulting services to 42 businesses in the region and created many new relationships with governments, businesses, Chambers of Commerce, and other local organizations, several important constraints remain. While BIMAP staff are skilled and knowledgeable, problems in scheduling and resource allocation have resulted in poor follow-up.  And, as many clients and liaison groups have only murky ideas about the project's benefits, limits, and policies, there have been instances of client dissatisfaction, unreasonable demands, and tense relations. Introducing the program into the various countries has consumed far more time and resources than had been anticipated.  Conflicts of interest and lack of incentives have prevented the formal coordinating bodies described in the PP (e.g., advisory committees) from providing effective dialogue and support. Moreover, there is a good deal of confusion in the field about the several TA programs available from A.I.D. and other donors, which are often seen as competitive or duplicative.  This creates a difficult entry situation for BIMAP, a problem which is compounded by the programs' differentiated fee structures, which often bear little (or no) relationship to the value of service provided.  If the project is to meet its full potential, it must have significant in-country support, which in turn requires the creation of mutually beneficial relationships with local organizations, through, e.g., provision of fees or training to the cooperating organization, as well as a stake in program growth; BIMAP has been reluctant to integrate its activities with those of other organizations. Stronger management support from RDO/C could help BIMAP broaden its strength - one-on-one TA - into a comprehensive regional program. Implementation in general has been made more difficult by the lack of a fully collaborative relationship between BIMAP and RDO/C. Lessons learned are:  (1) steps must be taken to ensure that a fully collaborative relationship occurs among the network of people and groups whose support is assumed in the project design; (2) sufficient time, resources, and other support must be allocated to create an infrastructure of coordination and support even at the expense of more visible short-term results; and (3) clear operating agreements are essential for the communication and understanding vital to successful implementation.","Attached to PD-AAU-344","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Management training|Business support services|Private enterprises|Consultants|Regional development|Beneficiary interviews","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAU344A.pdf","1,228 KB","004945 - Barbados Institute of Management and Productivity","","001757 - USAID.

"Evaluates P.L. 480 Title III Food for Development Program in Senegal. Joint AID/GOS evaluation covers the period 6/84-12/85 and is based in part on interviews with subproject (SP) personnel. Since the previous evaluation in 6/84, financial resources have been sufficient to permit SP's to be funded in a timely manner. Delays in providing justifications for some SP's, as well as in the review of these justifications by the Secretariat, have sometimes disrupted SP timetables, but nonetheless it appears that virtually all SP objectives will be met by the end of 1986 as planned.  Two exceptions are the hydrogeological study and SODEVA seed warehouse SP's, which will terminate in 1987.  Also, additional fourth tranche deposits to the special account of CFA 938 million are needed as soon as possible to permit full SP funding for 1986. Several actions have been taken to improve program management in response to earlier recommendations.  The Management Committee has held more frequent meetings, distributed its minutes to SP directors, and made more visits to SP's (although still more visits are recommended). Also, per diem allowances have been adjusted and steps have been taken to improve SP accounting procedures and internal controls. It is recommended that the Permanent Secretary of the Management Committee:  (1) assign personnel precise work schedules to ensure that SP justifications are reviewed quickly; and (2) ensure that Management Committee decisions are understood and put into practice by Secretariat staff.  It is also recommended that the Management Committee review at each meeting amounts disbursed to SP's, as well as any problems with justifications that may exist and then follow-up those problems immediately to ensure the proper flow of SP funds. Included in the evaluation are reports on the 15 SP's, which include, inter alia, activities in dune stabilization, charcoal production, agricultural policy, village woodlots, income generation associated with maternal/child health centers, vocational training, food technology, cookstoves, and state nurseries.","Evaluation period: Jun 1984-Dec 1985","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title III|Rice|Local currency|Balance of payments","Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU364.pdf","5,654 KB","000086 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to integrate crop and livestock enterprises in The Gambia, improve rural well-being, and assist the Government of The Gambia (GOTG) in natural resource planning.  Final evaluation covers the period 5/81-3/86 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel and farmers. The project experienced numerous delays in getting started, and operations were further delayed for several months following an attempted coup in 7/81.  However, 1984 and 1985 were more productive years, following a midterm redesign which deleted most activities in land use planning as well as a component to deliver carts on credit to farmers. The project initiated and pursued research - numerous varietal and feeding trials; and baseline, cattle herd, marketing, and farm management surveys, including a range inventory on 485,845 ha - but its overall strengths and worth rest with its wide-ranging extension efforts.  Accomplishments included: distributing 9 prototype cultivators for farm trials, extending deferred range/crop residue feeding programs in 4 villages, expanding maize production to over 17,000 ha, and working with 20 women's societies on intercropping demonstrations.  Lacking before-and-after data, it is assumed that extension activities have led to lasting accomplishments, and recommended that the maize production package be extended beyond progressive, well-to-do farmers to the majority in the maize growing region. In terms of rural acceptance of specific measures, it is recommended that a number of project elements are sustainable and worthy of continued efforts, inter alia: maize/fertilizer trials; varietal research on maize, forage grasses, legumes, and woody forage species; seed multiplication; forage legume trials and maize/legume intercropping trials; promotion of fertilizers, cultivators, shellers, and grinders - if complemented by farm credit and modifications to the cultivator; extension of the livestock feeding program, combined with a major thrust on herd management and culling and with the establishment of a GOTG rangeland unit.  Also recommended are: following the rural price/cost relationship through a socioeconomic unit, and establshing a farm credit/supply system for poor farmers; research on treating and using manure fertilizer; and cooperation among the range ecologist, forage agronomist, and animal nutritionist on an integrated development package.","Work order no. 14|Companion project evaluation summary: PD-BBE-211","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AFR-0510-I-00-4007-00","","3/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Mixed farming|Agricultural research|Agricultural extension|Beneficiary interviews","Gambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU367.pdf","21,527 KB","001035 - South-East Consortium for International Development (SECID)","","008545 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve the educational system in Cape Verde by constructing schools and by training teachers and educators. Contracted final evaluation covers the period through May 1986 and is based on discussions and informal interviews with key project and Verdean personnel, teacher questionnaires, site visits, and document review. The project not only complied with the terms of the grant agreement, but its positive, unanticipated benefits far surpassed the objectives therein stipulated.  The project built 102 classrooms, versus the target of 100 (building one third as many primary education facilities in 7 years as were built during 500 years of colonial rule), and trained 350 educators, 75% over the number planned.  With few exceptions, school construction is nearly complete (details awaiting completion include sand filling and cobblestoning of some playgrounds and turning on electric power in the few schools so equipped).  Although construction costs were generally higher than the budgeted amount, the project was completed within the terms of the grant agreement, thanks to the devaluation of the local currency and the rise of the dollar; without the favorable exchange rate it is doubtful whether even 75% of completion objectives would have been achieved. The project-funded schools have served not only as primary classrooms but as rural community centers, accomodating housing literacy classes, civic and party meetings, youth and women's organization meetings, and, in one community, even religious services.  A triple shift program in many of the classrooms and the community uses which they serve increase their functional use by 100-200%. The project achieved benefits in terms of process as well as product. It was completed some 5 years after the scheduled completion date due to the many internal constraints faced by Cape Verde during its first decade of independence.  However, extending the project from 2 to 7 years provided employment to the rural population during a critical drought period during which other employment was scarce.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Educational development|Primary schools|Primary education|Beneficiary interviews","Cape Verde","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU403.pdf","8,368 KB","008525 - USAID.

"Evaluates three private sector health projects in Haiti:  the Social-Medical Complex of Cite Simone (CMSCS) and two umbrella-type projects implemented by the Association des Oeuvres Privees de Sante (AOPS).  External evaluation covers the period through 4/86 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project and mission personnel. AOPS I & II and CMSCS have been successful on both programmatic and project levels.  On the programmatic level, the projects have helped to restructure attitudes towards health care delivery in Haiti; they have provided experimental feedback to the public sector, produced structural changes in AOPS grantee institutions, and elevated consciousness about provider accountability.  AOPS, in particular, because of the flexibility with which it has funded and implemented subprojects (SP's), continually rolling over lessons learned into successive SP's, has in effect acted as a large operations research (OR) program.  On the negative side, costs are an issue both for sustainability and replicability (especially with reference to project/SP size and adaptability to the public sector).  While CMSCS has increased its revenue base through patient, prescription, and school fees, no distinct method of reducing AOPS' major expense of providing a doctor as technical leader and SP manager has been found. On the project level, achievements have been excellent.  AOPS is well ahead of schedule:  25 SP's are active, with most functioning fairly well.  Some 352,300 (vs. 500,000 targeted) children and pregnant women have been vaccinated.  While family planning promotion is proceeding less smoothly (due partly to ideological resistance in individual institutions and partly to inadequate health worker training at all levels), contraceptive prevalence rates in four SP areas are above the national average. Progress, though less significant, has also been made in child health care areas such as growth monitoring and nutrition education; little has been done regarding oral rehydration therapy (ORT). CMSCS has achieved its targeted coverage and is improving the number and quality of its preventive and curative services.  For example, the number of prenatal visits at CMSCS has risen to 5 (vs. a WHO norm of 3) and, unlike AOPS, CMSCS has been very successful with ORT.  CMSCS is making appropriate adjustments to accommodate its greatly increased size and comprehensiveness. While there is no OR strategy as such, a research and evaluation unit has been set up and variety of OR activities have been undertaken.","Companion project evaluation summary: PD-AAU-656","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5927-C-00-3083-00","","4/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Private health care|Community health care|Maternal child health care|Primary health care","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU405.pdf","7,197 KB","000750 - Management Sciences for Health (MSH)","","000186 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report (9/82-9/86) on a project to introduce farming systems research (FSR) into the program of the Tanzania Agricultural Research Organization (TARO). Due to funding limitations, TA from the Consortium for International Development (CID) was reduced in 9/85 and project support of food crop research was eliminated.  This and other factors (e.g., inadequate counterpart staffing) reduced project progress. The project has a mixed record.  (1) Of 10 researchers sent for U.S. Ph.D. and M.Sc. training, 1 has completed training and returned; the FAO will finance the remaining training costs of the other 9.  More positively, excellent workshops, seminars, and on-the-job training for TARO FSR staff, commodity researchers, and extensionists has created a small, competent group which will be a valuable resource in future FSR development.  Commodity researchers in particular have become convinced of the value of FSR.  (2) CID efforts to improve TARO research management were nullified by the dismissal of the TARO Director and other top staff shortly before project termination.  Efforts to establish and strengthen ties to other agricultural organizations, both domestic and international proved more successful.  (3) TARO has partially completed targeted land development at Ilonga Research Station.  However, funds for this effort are depleted and no provision has been made to secure additional funds.  Contracted construction of 19 other facilities at Ilonga (laboratories, workshops, storage facilities, and administration buildings), while delayed, should be completed by the end of CY86. The project did introduce the FSR approach, but on too limited a scale and for too short a time to significantly improve the research program - the use of FSR as a technology development and extension strategy was tested in 2 rather than 3 agro-ecological zones, and instead of 18,000 farmers in 15 districts using new technology, some 500 farmers in 3 districts are using at least one technology package.  As for the future, it is uncertain as to how long the Government will provide recurrent cost support for TARO's FSR Unit, and while TARO's human resource base seems fairly strong, there is no assurance that the U.S. participants will work with TARO upon return (all are expected to do so, although perhaps not specifically with the FSR Unit). Also, only a small fraction of TARO's staff are agricultural economists and none are social scientists.  In sum, while TARO will most likely continue to sustain a national food crop/adaptive research program, institutionalization of the FSR approach remains in doubt.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","10/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Farming systems research|Food crops|Research organizations|Institution building|Research management|Management development|Personnel development|Research facilities|Beneficiary count|Limited data","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU448.pdf","532 KB","008612 - USAID.

"Presents final evaluation - based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel - of the PVO component of A.I.D.'s reconstruction program in Southern Italy following the 11/80 earthquake. Catholic Relief Services, Save the Children Federation, and the Salvation Army World Service Office have used A.I.D. matching and umbrella grants to assist nearly 60 local organizations and hundreds of families - about 85,000 direct beneficiaries - in the earthquake zone. Through subprojects (SP's) which have met A.I.D. criteria and Congressional intent, PVO's have rebuilt or constructed new facilities in education, health, housing, welfare services, industry, and livestock-related areas - providing not only immediate relief but helping establish health care facilities in areas previously not reached.  By 12/31/86 all approved construction, reconstruction, and renovation will be completed. The cooperative, participatory environment fostered by AID/Naples was a main contributor to success.  AID/N's ""arms length"" management of the program generally avoided increased demands on its staff, while its consultative role has been valued by the PVO's and has provided effective backstopping.  For their part, PVO's have successfully managed private monies as well as grant funds and have solved all operational problems. Specific findings and recommendations are as follows.  (1) PVOs' tendency to focus on areas where they have ties enhances the chances of SP success but also reduces broader benefits.  PVO's are able to help develop innovative models for national education and health programs and work with defferent government levels. (2) The PVO consortium IDEA (Italian Disaster Earthquake Assistance) was highly effective in lobbying Congress for funds and generally effective in managing the budget allocation process, but lacked sufficient technical expertise in approving SP's other than for construction.  A.I.D. should retain SP approval authority.  (3) The matching grant program generally slowed programming and did not effectively elicit private donations. The 1982 decision to move to OPG's was sound; in the future A.I.D. should consider OPG's and/or fixed amount reimbursement to fund PVO's.  (4) The dollar's fluctuation forced A.I.D. and PVO's to seek areas to cut costs. A.I.D. should protect future programs from large currency fluctuations. (5) PVOs' failure to satisfy technical and administrative staffing needs early on impaired project soundness and necessitated corrective investment.  Measures are also needed to avoid the information gaps that affected monitoring and implementation. (6) A.I.D. and PVO's should see that support mobilized among defined U.S. constituencies in foreign aid - here, catalyzed by attention on the earthquake - can be sustained.","Appended: Part II, appendices to final evaluation report of the PVO|component","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Earthquakes|Disaster reconstruction|Private voluntary organizations|Beneficiary count","Italy","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU455.pdf","6,391 KB","","","008561 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen Ecuador's capacity to manage forest resources.  Midterm evaluation covers the period 9/82-5/86 and is based on document review, subproject (SP) site visits, and interviews with National Forestry Division (DINAF) and Mission officials. The project has made some progress in productive forestry, but little in the areas of protective forestry or institution building.  Regarding productive forestry, 1,770 of a targeted 10,000 ha have been planted in the mountains and the humid tropics. Equipment has been provided for a sawmill and a botanical study is in progress.  In the area of protective forestry, progress toward delimiting and protecting large areas of natural forest has been made only in the Pichincha area. Mapping equipment has been purchased for use in other areas, but field demonstrations of protective techniques have not been carried out. In the area of institution building, project training and TA have made solid contributions to the technical skills of various forestry sector institutions, but little has been done to meet the project's central institutional objective, that of strengthening DINAF's capacity to support these various institutions.  In fact, neither DINAF nor the TA team are committed to this objective (which emerged only during the latter stages of project design) and neither have the experience needed to carry it out.  This institutional shortfall is also due partly to lack of continuity in leadership (DINAF has changed directors approximately twice each year) and to DINAF's failure to assign qualified personnel to the project (this latter may be ascribed partially to a government austerity program). Although the project's problems consist predominantly of management lapses, various technical and sociological areas have been neglected as well, including:  management of natural vegetation; pest, disease, and fire control; tree species testing and market studies; and involvement of small landholders and of indigenous persons in the Amazon region.  As of 6/86, only 24% of project funds had been spent - a reflection of DINAF's inability and reluctance to take on subprojects. The project's problems can be solved by fine-tuning; strategic decisions must be made regarding DINAF's role and the project's management structure.  Among the possible courses of action are: (1) creating a DINAF system for coordinating and managing its own and other organizations' forestry activities; (2) focusing TA on DINAF's traditional forestry extension system; (3) changing the status of DINAF to a semiautonomous institution; or (4) extending the PACD without increasing funding (this alternative should be pursued only if real progress is made in the next year).","Attached to PD-AAU-460","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0000-I-08-4104-00","","9/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Forestry","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAU460A.pdf","8,139 KB","001600 - Associates in Rural Development, Inc.

"Evaluates demonstration projects by Helen Keller International, Inc. (HKI) in Fiji, Western Samoa, and Papua New Guinea to upgrade community-based educational and rehabilitative services to blind persons.  External evaluation covers the period through 3/86 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with HKI and cooperating agency personnel and with beneficiaries. The Fiji project, which served as a pilot for the others, was an unmitigated success.  Working with the Fiji Society for the Blind (FSB), HKI succeeded in upgrading educational programs for blind children (in particular, developing integrated education as an alternative to segregated programs) and in initiating outreach services to blind adults in rural areas.  The project was expanded into a national program for primary eye health care and services to blind and low-vision preschool children, which is restoring or saving the vision of hundreds each year. Further, the project contributed, most notably at the community level, to heightened awareness of the capabilities of blind persons and blindness prevention strategies.  FSB and the Government of Fiji's (GOF) Ministry of Health and Social Welfare provide a sound infrastructure on which program continuation can be based as well as capable personnel. However, some problems did emerge, related to:  fitting certain programs into the GOF's overall education and social welfare structures; staff security; and the need to continue to support communication between key individuals who now have limited contact with HKI. Initial assistance to the Western Samoa Association for the Blind (WSAB) has been very useful, though provided less regularly than in Fiji due to the island's low population and WSAB's uncertain support.  The program still lacks a sound structural base; however, HKI has put in place a viable framework - given continued outside support - for services to blind persons.  The program's survival despite less than ideal circumstances shows that it was carefully planned, developed with attention to local needs and restrictions, and well-staffed by local personnel. The Papua New Guinea project has faced many challenges.  Some approaches to training local field workers and structuring the service organizations have been more successful than others, but it is too early to be able to predict long-term impact or any needed changes.  HKI has been especially successful in strengthening the National Board for the Disabled's leadership role which, in turn, has increased awareness of the national and provincial governments of the need for quality, appropriate services for disabled persons. Finally, HKI has successfully brought together other international and regional resources which have contributed to programs in these and other countries in the region.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0269-G-SS-5024-00","","3/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Blindness|Rehabilitative medicine|Education|Community services|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Fiji|Western Samoa|Papua New Guinea","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU484.pdf","9,615 KB","000566 - Helen Keller Worldwide.

"Evaluates Matching Grant to Project Concern International (PCI) project to develop a model rural primary health care (PHC) system employing trained community health workers (CHW's) in the Toledo District of Belize.  External evaluation covers the period 1/83-9/86 and is based on site visits and interviews with Ministry of Health (MOH) officials and beneficiaries. The project has met some of its targets, but many problems remain. On the positive side, PCI has:  (1) shown that CHW's can increase rural access to some basic health services and effectively help nurses in outreach and mobile health clinics; (2) modified its training during the course of the project to make it more relevant, and produced a manual which clarifies the roles/relationships of health workers; (3) developed a functioning cross-sectoral District Health Team; (4) developed some coordination with related community programs; (5) established village health committees (VHC's), although not all are functional; (6) tried to ensure that a Belizean will take over project administration, and that PHC is given more political and financial support at the national level; and (7) completed one health survey to identify actual health problems, with others planned or underway. The major obstacle to creating a self-reliant PHC system is lack of host government commitment.  Although the MOH has a stated policy of priority for PHC and has developed a National PHC Committee, its support to the project has been inadequate. Prospects for sustainability are dim as the supervisory structure for CHW's depends largely on foreign advisors and it is unlikely the MOH will be able to supply enough nurses as supervisors. Rural nurses' posts are unfilled throughout the country and turnover is high. Most VHC's seem weak, ineffective, or uninterested; apparently MOH/PCI community development and follow-up have been insufficient.  As a result, there is only sporadic village support for the CHW's and villagers are generally unwilling to pay for CHW services.  Also, the project's training plan was too ambitious and has been scaled back - of the 50-60 CHW's originally to be trained, only one group of 15 has been trained (and only 9 have remained in the field), and another group of 15 will complete training in 1986.  Other difficulties include:  (1) an inadequate and inconsistent information system for reporting CHW activities - baseline and benchmark surveys are needed; and (2) inadequate logistic, supply, and referral systems. The project demonstrates the inevitable cultural, economic, and political barriers that slow the development of new PHC systems - even in a politically stable and relatively homogenous nation such as Belize.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Community health care|Health policy|Private voluntary organizations|Beneficiary interviews","Belize","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU509.pdf","1,727 KB","000750 - Management Sciences for Health (MSH)","","000088 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to provide agricultural sector support in Madagascar through TA, training, and a commodity import program (CIP). Formative evaluation covers the period 5/85-9/86 and is based on document review and interviews with project personnel. The project is progressing despite an understandably slow start-up - this is the first bilateral project to be implemented in Madagascar in over 15 years.  Initial delays in the CIP were overcome, and effective, rapid disbursement procedures have been set up.  The tractors and road equipment spare parts procured under the CIP have gone mostly to private users (i.e., farmers, contractors, quarry operators), with most of the latter being used for the construction and maintenance of secondary roads. The training and TA component, on the other hand, has been hampered by its diffuse nature (over 21 activities within 6 ministries were to be implemented) and by USAID staff limitations (only one person available to work in these areas).  A little more than half of the budget for this component has been disbursed.  The most important activities have been: (1) agricultural policy activities (e.g, document inventory, policy analysis and informal dialogue, and a high-level seminar) conducted through S&T's Agriculture Policy and Analysis Project (APAP); and (2) training in economic and financial analysis and project appraisal conducted by USDA.  Activities related to land tenure, and in support of skills development for labor-intensive road maintenance, have been delayed, but are seen as potentially very important to both policy decisions and production increases. Only limited progress has been made in activities involving linkages with international agricultural research centers. As the project moves into implementing its first amendment, training and TA have become more focused on policy dialogue and parastatal divestiture studies.  The diversity of activities in the original design, while perhaps important for setting up relationships with Malagasy institutions and examining possible targets for future aid, is recognized as no longer appropriate. Parastatal activities have begun well (a scope of work, to be implemented in collaboration with a World Bank project, has been defined), and a second APAP activity is planned. Madagascar has provided funds as needed for data analysis and publication, in-country training, and logistic support: effective financial management methods have been established. However, the lack of a regular USAID project manager has resulted in lack of cohesion in project management and financial tracking. The second amendment should continue the CIP, policy dialogue, and parastatal divestiture efforts and initiate activities to privatize some services to farmers.","Attached to PD-AAU-520","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural development|Agricultural policy|Agricultural planning|Limited data plus","Madagascar","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAU520A.pdf","1,555 KB","008572 - USAID.

Final, external evaluation covers the period 9/81-6/86 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel. INE has made great strides in establishing itself as a viable institution.  It has developed substantial technical competence in: energy policy studies; NCE demonstrations; alternative energy technologies (e.g., small hydro, solar, geothermal, biogas); industrial energy conservation; and national energy planning.  In several cases, INE has been influential in decisionmaking.  INE is also increasing its information dissemination and technical outreach activities.  For example, INE has been designated as the national center of a new regional energy information exchange network being organized by the Latin American Energy Association (OLADE), and it has successfully worked with private firms in adapting NCE technology to selected markets, emphasizing local manufacture wherever possible. The project's development impact includes consumer benefits from several NCE demonstration projects; training and experience gained by INE staff; benefits to other organizations, both public and private, that worked with INE; and general benefits to the nation from INE's strengthened analytical energy planning capabilities.  However, greater project impact was limited by several factors.  (1) The project was overly ambitious, expecting INE to become the dominant entity in national energy planning despite the size and financial resources of competing agencies. (2) The negative attitude towards INE developed by USAID/E during early implementation problems persists despite INE's favorable record since the mid-term evaluation.  However, it is understood that the Mission was under pressure to deobligate funds and has experienced several staffing problems.  (3) INE experienced its own problems stemming from inexperience, personnel turnover (including the Executive Director), and changes in program planning and definition. Several lessons can be learned about institution building projects: (1) work plans/schedules should be kept flexible, and encouragement should be given consistently to the recipient institution; (2) institutions gain credibility over time, through the quality of their work; this cannot be conferred by edict; (3) progress cannot be judged by spending patterns; (4) delays can be avoided if the new institution uses accounting procedures which are consistent with those of donor agencies and is properly informed of the impact of A.I.D. procurement regulations on project activities.","Attached to PD-AAU-549|Loan no. 518-W-039|Later ed.: PD-AAW-972","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Energy planning|Alternative energy technology|Energy policy|Institution building","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAU549A.pdf","2,348 KB","003604 - Union Carbide Corp.","","004103 - Ecuador.

"Evaluates project implemented by CARE to build and maintain community potable water systems in Haiti.  USAID/E team rapid assessment covers the period 6/84-4/86 and is based on site visits and interviews with personnel from USAID/H, CARE, and the National Potable Water Service (SNEP). Construction activities fell behind schedule from start-up and have continued in that vein.  Only the system at Rosier is completed. Construction is 3 months behind at Port-a-Piment and 2 months behind at St. Georges, Arniquet, and Maniche.  Work will begin on 4 other systems between 4/86 and 8/86.  A number of factors are responsible.  Initial problems included unrealistic project design expectations, staffing problems at CARE, the late disbursement of the second - and major - tranche of project funds, and a poor working between SNEP and CARE. During the project's second year, implementation was further impeded by heavy rains, fuel shortages, and, most seriously, growing civil unrest culminating in the overthrow of the Duvalier regime.  Due to the civil disturbances, field travel was restricted and the project office had to close from time to time. There have also been difficulties in promoting strong community participation.  Most of the participating villagers are either the poor who are providing wage labor or the town ""notables"" and project animators who motivate, plan, and organize system construction. Voluntary labor is provided rather readily in places where the work phase is short or where there is a history of community self-help, but where the opposite is true, as in Port-a-Piment, voluntary work has been especially problematic. Problems have also stemmed from differing perceptions of Food for Work (FFW) rations, which are used to compensate residents who have already donated voluntary labor.  CARE believes the rations enourage people who are working to develop their community, whereas villagers see them as a wage which, at one-third the minimum daily rate, is insufficient.  Further complicating the community participation issue have been the protests and demonstrations attendant upon Duvalier's overthrow.  CARE will have to spend considerable time to regain the confidence of community members and may have to change its ration policy. CARE has already taken several positive steps to improve program productivity.  Food distribution (although not the ration size) has been made more equitable, schedules have been adjusted to allow workers more time with their families, and CARE staff is now working simultaneously at six project sites in order to increase coverage.","Attached to PD-AAU-567","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Water supply structures|Potable water|Construction sites|Community self help|Community participation|Private voluntary organizations","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAU567A.pdf","998 KB","008554 - USAID.

"Evaluates the P.L. 480 local currency program in the Dominican Republic and the projects funded thereby.  External evaluation covers the period through 8/86 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel. The program, which includes over 100 projects (underway or planned) and a total value of programmed resources approaching $RD 554 million, is impressive for its variety and extensiveness; it has played a decisive role in the national economy.  Yet, despite the program's overall success and its competent coordinating staff, notable weaknesses exist in financial management (slow disbursement, poor documentation of expenditures, weak overall controls) and in systems for reporting to A.I.D.  At the individual project level, the weakest areas are accounting, reporting, and monitoring and evaluation.  Of the 69 projects specifically evaluated herein, only 3 have the capacity to measure their results. Regarding the impacts of the 69 projects, the following generalizations can be made:  (1) Channeling of credit through commercial banks with a central control by the Investment Fund for Economic Development (FIDE) is achieving significant success. Private banks have proven willing to risk capital in order to provide timely service to their clients.  Also, strategies have been found for providing credit to marginal producers, which had been a concern. (2) Some 380,000 days of work have been generated since 1984 through rural infrastructure and irrigation projects for nonskilled, temporary laborers.  Also, industrial free zone projects have provided an interesting employment generation model; these projects vary widely in unit costs, however. (3) PVO projects have been quite successful in comparison to those of other sectors and are superior in complying with financial controls as well.  Only credit projects have a better compliance record.  PVO's provide a solid institutional base for expanding the P.L. 480 resources channeled to them. (4) While it appears from the project perspective that export promotion has been successful, this is not reflected in national-level data. The 69 projects evaluated fall into the following categories: credit, savings mobilization, and agricultural insurance (10 projects); road infrastructure (10); irrigation infrastructure (6); electric infrastructure (15); other infrastructure (5); PVO activities (10); extension investigation and agricultural studies (8); and free zones and export promotion (5).  Summaries of the projects are provided in a companion volume (PD-AAU-551).","V. 2: PD-AAU-551","Special Evaluation","Documents","517-0000-C-00-6031-00","","8/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace|Counterpart fund|Local currency|Development projects","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU550.pdf","2,701 KB","001046 - Rural Development Services","","008537 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project by Project Concern International (PCI) to help the Government of The Gambia (GOTG) design and test a replicable, low-cost, self-financing primary health care (PHC) system. External evaluation covers period 1979-85 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel and beneficiaries. The project has made major contributions to improving basic health services throughout The Gambia.  PCI's approach to the development of a PHC system has proven appropriate to the Gambian political and economic environment and is apparently adaptable to other African countries. Although PCI's direct involvement in the GOTG bureacracy may delay some achievements, it maximizes the possibility that the PHC system will be replicable and sustainable.  The system which PCI has helped to create relies on volunteer village health workers (VHW's) who are chosen by their village, feel a sense of duty towards it, and are proud of their status; although many complain of the lack of village support and want to be paid, very few drop out. PCI's strategy of focusing on training has been sound.  The VHW's trained under the project are not only increasing the availability of health services in rural areas but, it is likely, will also be effective in improving overall health standards. Further, the GOTG has accepted full responsibility for the training system established under the project, and is committed to strengthening and sustaining it.  A GOTG counterpart, trained under the project, has taken over administration of the training program. PCI field staff, backed up by a well-organized support system at their U.S. headquarters, appear to have been competent and effective. Unfortunately, the project demonstrates what appears to be a common problem in PVO-sponsored PHC programs:  insufficient time and insufficient funding to ensure (1) that the PHC system is fully developed, with strong community participation and full community financing; and (2) that its effectiveness and impact have been measured and documented.  In this case USAID/G terminated the PCI project early as part of a phase-out of all health sector assistance.  The Gambian PHC system is one of Africa's best models (particularly in the support, supervision, and financing of health workers), but it needs, and merits, much fine tuning.  USAID/G support should have been continued.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5927-C-00-3083-00","","5/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Pilot projects|Community health care|Rural areas|Paramedical education|Beneficiary interviews","Gambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU584.pdf","1,619 KB","000750 - Management Sciences for Health (MSH)","","000186 - USAID.

"Evaluates P.L. 480 Title II programs implemented in Burkina Faso by Cathwel (the local name for Catholic Relief Services). Evaluation covers the period through 7/86 and was conducted by USAID/BF, Cathwel, and Government of Burkina Faso (GOBF) personnel based on document review, site visits, and interviews with program personnel. For the past 20 years, Cathwel has conducted three food aid programs. (1) A Food and Nutrition Program operates at 162 sites, reaches about 75,000 children and their mothers, and includes growth surveillance, health and nutrition education, food rations, and associated development activities.  (2) A School Feeding Program serves a noon meal to some 240,000 students at 1,338 rural schools (75% of Burkina's primary schools); a development-oriented ""education-production"" program operates at 23 of the schools.  (3) A much smaller Food for Work (FFW) program includes 101 development projects, most of them run by village groups and involving construction or water development.  FFW was reorganized in 1985 to increase cooperation with the GOBF in choosing projects. Three factors have recently combined to encourage changes in the Cathwel program.  (1) The GOBF has become increasingly critical of food aid, which it fears may increase dependency and discourage development activities that are not supported by food aid; food distribution in health facilities is particularly opposed by provincial and national health officials.  However, these positions contrast with positive village-level attitudes. (2) Changes in P.L. 480 and Title II regulations allow new, developmental uses of food.  Multi-year programs, monetization, and new commodity sources encourage innovative, development-oriented activities.  (3) Cathwel itself is looking for approaches that emphasize development rather than relief while expanding the management role of local people. A gradual shift from three separate program areas to a single village-level integrated FFW program is recommended.  Such a program would allow villagers to address a number of development needs, including health and education.  Villages which choose not to participate could be phased out over a 5-year period, with food-surplus regions being given priority for phase out.  Cathwel should collaborate closely with the GOBF in planning and executing these changes, which should:  (1) increase flexibility in the use of food aid for an integrated spectrum of development activities; (2) respond positively to local government criticisms of the program by linking it directly to Burkina's development goals; and (3) streamline Cathwel operations and thus facilitate management.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title II|Private voluntary organizations|Maternal child feeding programs|School feeding programs|Food for Work|Beneficiary count","Burkina Faso","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU585.pdf","1,952 KB","008520 - USAID.

"Evaluates a Health, Nutrition, and Family Planning Program implemented in Bangladesh by Save the Children Federation (SCF) under an A.I.D. Matching Grant.  External evaluation covers the period through 1/86 and is based on site visits, including a visit to SCF's U.S. headquarters, and interviews with project personnel. SCF's community-based integrated rural development (CBIRD) approach is well designed, well organized, and apparently effective in promoting the health of women and children.  The project provides low-cost, door-to-door primary health care (PHC) and has also improved health by upgrading related economic, social, and environmental conditions through activities in agriculture, income generation, literacy, road building, and fish culture.  SCF has made certain that the project encourages participation by all members of the community - including those not usually involved in the decisionmaking process, especially women and poor families.  Project management is excellent. Bangladeshi staff are competent and dedicated; SCF has provided strong TA and financial support; and monitoring and evaluation are advanced over many similar PVO programs, functioning not only to record impact but also to inform villagers and leaders. Average infant and child mortality rates, average birth rates, and average population growth rates for the four SCF impact areas are decreasing, and are lower than in Bangladesh overall.  Infant and child mortality rates dropped perceptibly (by 25% and 13%, respectively) during the first year, even before SCF had completed health training and staff support in all areas, and despite the lack of government immunization programs in three areas.  Such a major change in so short a time must result in part from exogenous factors, however.  Moreover, when disaggregated the data show mixed results in differenct impact areas. Despite its successes, the project displays some weaknesses. Data collection and processing need to streamlined.  The Dhaka office badly needs an expanded health information system and more staff to analyze and use the large volume of health data being collected by field staff. Also, little progress has been made toward developing self-sustaining, self-financing programs that do not depend on external support. Although this is an SCF goal, there are no schedules or target dates for promoting phase-over to local control.  Finally, local cost recovery has not been achieved despite SCF's use of a variety of income generation and local revenue schemes.  SCF cannot consider its Bangladesh project fully successful until at least one village can manage self-sustaining PHC and until infant and children mortality can be controlled over several years.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5927-C-00-3083-00","","1/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Integrated rural development|Community participation|Private voluntary organizations","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU587.pdf","2,345 KB","000750 - Management Sciences for Health (MSH)","","000186 - USAID.

"Appropriate Technology International (ATI), a private, nonprofit development assistance organization, was created through a 1976 Congressional mandate to experiment with and develop new approaches to technology development and transfer.  This evaluation study, based on field visits to ATI projects, analyzes ATI's success to date. ATI's unique role in economic development assistance - to link appropriate technology and small-scale enterprise development within an experimental learning framework - is inherently risky. Thus, it is not expected that each ATI project will be successful.  Still, ATI has met all quantifiable performance indicators under its current cooperative agreement with A.I.D., and its overall capacity to plan and implement projects has grown steadily (though not without accompanying weaknesses).  The direction, quality, and impact of its technology development activities have also in general improved, although ATI's concentrated attention on the replication of hard technologies has diminished other important aspects of its mission, particularly the development and transfer of innovative soft technology.  Projects under the cooperative agreement have not yet matured enough to provide many benefits to the poor. With regard to project planning, ATI has significantly improved its technical and commercial appraisals, although further refinement and more consistent application are needed for the latter.  More careful attention to market analysis and the assessment of implementing organizations' capabilities is also needed. ATI's field management allows for a responsive, flexible working style, which, however, has the disadvantage of weakening ATI's ability to learn from its experience; lessons learned have not been systematically identified and disseminated.  Monitoring and evaluation systems should be revised and integrated with planning and field supervision. Some aspects of the A.I.D. system and in particular its oversight role impede attainment of ATI objectives; also, better communications with Missions are needed.  Finally, although A.I.D. financial support is declining, ATI has not yet succeeded in finding other funding sources.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Appropriate technology|Technology transfer|Development organizations|Private voluntary organizations","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL084.pdf","208 KB","006434 - Devres, Inc.","","001373 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen Jamaican PVO's by (according to the second project amendment) developing a United Way fundraising system. Mid-term, external evaluation covers the period 7/83-6/86 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project and PVO personnel. Progress in achieving the project purpose, as amended, was evinced when United Way of Jamaica (UWJ) was incorporated in 1/85 into the Council of Voluntary Social Services (CVSS), a PVO umbrella organization, and introduced the United Way model of fundraising.  It should be noted, however, that UWJ initially adopted United Way of America's ""Full-Service"" organizational model, which does not stress the development of fundraising as the single or primary organizational function but makes it one program component among many others.  Other United Way models, more appropriate for a United Way in its initial stages, are available and they should be identified and used. Activities during the 17 months since UWJ's founding have included planning, staffing the administrative headquarters in Kingston and regional offices in May Pen and Montego Bay, establishing financial systems for CVSS and CVSS/UWJ, and training board members and staff in the theory and operations of the United Way.  Another significant activity has been the creation of a highly professional and tightly managed process for allocating project funds of $2 million plus the equivalent in local currency to local PVO projects.  The allocation process includes a built in system of PVO program and fiscal accountability.  An additional need is for UWJ to establish a program monitoring system which affords a key role to CVSS in monitoring the provision of assistance and services to PVO's. There is convincing evidence that UWJ will be able to raise at least 1.5 million Jamaican dollars for the 1986-87 year.  Strong local support has been established, particularly in the private for-profit sector. The United Way concept of fundraising and distributing funds to human service organizations has captured the imagination and support of leaders in the Jamaican business and professional community.  UWJ has mobilized a strong cadre of volunteers from these communities - its first pilot campaign (1985/86) received pledges of more than 1 million Jamaican dollars from the corporate community, about 10% of which were in in-kind contributions.  In addition, the Government of Jamaica has shown its support through financial contributions.  UWJ also benefits from its link to the historically powerful CVSS.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Financial resources|Private sector|Beneficiary interviews","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU669.pdf","2,441 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"Provides final Mission report on a project to establish an agricultural production model that could be replicated by small hillside farmers throughout Jamaica's watersheds.  The report covers activities through the amended PACD of 9/30/84. Due to the costly technologies and the complex management structure which it employed, the project failed not only to establish a replicable agricultural production model, but also to provide sustainable benefits in its target area.  There was a definite increase in agricultural production in the target area while the project was in existence, but is doubtful whether this increase can be sustained.  Soil erosion was only temporarily slowed; most farmers did not maintain the soil conservation treatments, and the technology was far too costly to be replicated. Also, while a great deal of training was provided, the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) was able to employ only a fraction of the trained staff after the PACD. Data from a comprehensive farm and household survey undertaken between 6/82 and 6/83 were compiled and digitized and provided to the MOA's Data Bank and Evaluation Division which had received a grant under Project 5320061 to undertake a thorough analysis of the data.  This activity was not completed as of 9/86. The project - which included activities in forestation, engineering, farmer organization, agricultural credit, water supply, electrification, road construction, and housing - shows the futility of trying to address too many objectives.  It also teaches us to avoid project designs that: unrealistically attempt to reach 100% of the farmers or lands within a geographic area; depend on large-scale subsidies to induce participation; or employ soil conservation structures that farmers cannot afford. Finally, strict management controls are needed to prevent the intrusion of political patronage actions.

"Evaluates program, implemented under a family planning project in Bangladesh, to increase the use of the intrauterine device (IUD) by women of child bearing age by reimbursing clients and providers for reasonable costs of transportation and exceptional method-related services.  External evaluation covered the period 10/84-9/85 and was based on a study of 67 government clinics under 67 upazilas, 8 non-governmental organizations under 8 upazilas, and a stratified sample survey of 3,000 IUD acceptors. The study estimated the total number of IUD's inserted during the reporting period to be 394,272.  This figure is 7.5% lower than the insertion figure (423,841) reported in the management information system of the Population Control Directorate (PCD), the implementing agency. The percentage of IUD acceptors receiving a follow-up visit, the percentage reported having a reinsertion, and the percentage reporting receipt of transportation costs were estimated at 80.7, 2.0, and 82.2 respectively.  The cumulative probability of continued IUD use was found to be 84.1% at the end of 3 months, 76.2% at the end of 6 months, and 67.3% at the end of 12 months. A comparison of some important estimates reported in the previous two and the present evaluation study is provided.

"Provides final Mission report (5/82-9/85) on a project to develop the institutional capability of the Small Business Association of Jamaica (SBAJ) to provide TA, information, marketing, administrative, advocacy, and other services to the small business sector. The project had limited success in expanding the SBAJ's capacity. While the SBAJ increased its membership from 500 to approximately 1,500 members, this fell far short of its expectation of 5,000 members; about 20% of members are outside of Kingston, vs. a targeted 30%.  SBAJ staff was increased to five professionals and four support personnel, vs. respective targets of three and eight. SBAJ targets for bulk buying, administrative services, and TA (the latter through International Executive Service Corps seminars and workshops) were achieved while A.I.D. funds were available, but SBAJ has not been able to sustain these services. Nor did the organization make much progress in its attempt to set up information and data base programs, although a good deal of effort was put into these activities. The planned directories, pamphlet, and data base were not produced; monthly bulletins were issued for a time, but have been discontinued. On the positive side, the project strengthened SBAJ's advocacy role on behalf of its members, increasing the number of flea markets to one a week and providing a good library. Lessons which may be learned from the project include the following. (1) Realistic goals and benchmarks should be established at the outset, along with interim checkpoints to allow opportunities for mid-course correction.  (2) Continued funding could be made dependent on the grantee achieving the interim goals or obtaining a waiver under special circumstances. (3) Support for institution building must be dependent on the institution's plans and actual achievements during the life of the project, aimed at sustaining its activities after grant funds are exhausted.

"Evaluates project to strengthen Peruvian capacities to develop small hydroelectric power plants (SHPP's).  External evaluation covers the period 11/80-11/86 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel and beneficiaries. Despite delays due in part to the restructuring of ELECTROPERU and the Regional Electric Companies (REC's), the project has: (1) completed construction of 3 of the 10 planned SHPP's and associated distribution networks; (2) supported development of a national private industry to manufacture equipment for SHPP's; (3) trained ELECTROPERU staff to design, evaluate, and implement SHPP subprojects (SP's); (4) implanted in ELECTROPERU a methodology for economic evaluation of SP's, and thus ensured that the SP's will have adequate economic benefits; and (5) encouraged rural people to work with ELECTROPERU in furthering rural electrification.  In all, the project has significantly helped raised the rural standard of living and thereby has achieved its primary purpose. Several problems require immediate attention, however.  (1) Training to promote productive uses of electricity has not occurred.  A consultant should be hired to help ELECTROPERU's new Electricity Promotion Service in this regard.  (2) ELECTROPERU has not used the TA designed to train REC personnel in SHPP operation and maintainance.  The project should, inter alia, use ELECTROLIMA's technical schools to provide this training and employ grant funds to provide training and equipment assistance to the schools.  (2) The efficiency of onsite construction inspectors suffers greatly from a lack of radios and vehicles; these should be provided.  (3) The slow procedures used to resolve contractor claims has delayed the construction of several SP's; some will not be completed by the project's 5/19/87 end. Extraordinary measures are needed to resolve claims (e.g., contract more personnel for the Project Office, permit payments for additional work to be approved without recourse to ELECTROPERU's senior management) and hasten construction (possibly use force account construction to supplement the work of contractors who are furthest behind).  (4) The transfer of the Electrification Project Units (EPU's) to the REC's could delay SP supervision and approval/disbursement of payments to contractors. EPU personnel and procedures for supervising the SP's and for handling project funds should remain unchanged for the remainder of the project. (5) ELECTROPERU has not handled A.I.D. funds expeditiously. Final accounting for completed SP's, and payment of pending invoices and related recordkeeping should be expedited. The report also identifies and recommends solutions for 11 long-term problems.","Spanish ed.: PD-AAU-454|Companion project evaluation summary: PD-AAV-514","Special Evaluation","Documents","527-0226-C-00-6775-00","","11/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Electrification|Rural areas|Hydroelectric power plants|Small scale energy systems|Public services|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU723.pdf","2,156 KB","000743 - Arthur D.

"Provided herein is a detailed examination of the U.S. Food Assistance program in Chad, Mali, and the Sudan during 1984-85. The program helped 6 million people in Sudan, 2 million in Mali, and over a million in Chad cope with the worst food crisis of written record.  The program succeeded by identifying food distribution channels - especially PVO's and the private sector (coordination with other donors helped in Mali and Chad only) - and by utilizing all distribution modes, including specialized feeding programs (which allowed targeted beneficiaries to be reached regularly), monetization (a key component in all 3 countries), and general distribution (effective when well-monitored).  Also, the traditional coping mechanisms (e.g., sharing, use of famine foods) of the affected populations served greatly to extend the distribution of emergency foods. Program effectiveness was enhanced by the use of socioeconomic and nutrition/health data to target needy persons and areas for supplemental feeding.  This was especially evident in Chad; lack of supplemental feeding in Sudan and Mali reduced the impact on those most at risk, especially children.  Packaging of resources (e.g., providing technical assistance, money, seeds, transport as well as food) also increased effectiveness, particularly for certain distribution modes such as resettlement in Chad. Although the 3 USAID's performed well, given limited staff resources, program management suffered in that it was attempted within normal development channels, and mostly by persons with little or no emergency food aid experience.  There was a striking lack of preparedness - although the drought was already in its third year - on the part of USAID's, donors, and host governments; needs assessments were far off the mark, due to lack of accurate data.  Also, monitoring was introduced late and focused more on adherence to procedures than on impact assessment. Development programs in the three countries were not being aimed at raising inadequate income levels - the root of both underdevelopment and food emergencies.  Nor, except for resettlement efforts in Chad and minor Food for Work projects in Mali, did the program address the income problem. Included is a detailed strategy, based on lessons learned during the program, for achieving U.S. emergency food assistance objectives.","Earlier ed.: PN-AAW-223|In: US response to the African famine, 1984-1986, v. 1","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Emergency food distribution|Food aid programs|Famine|Drought|Disaster preparedness","Mali|Chad|Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL082.pdf","238 KB","006434 - Devres, Inc.","","002672 - USAID.

"While the efforts of U.S. and international donors saved many African lives during the 1984-86 drought and related famine, coordinated disaster relief (DR) needs improvement.  This paper reviews the policy formation and management of the U.S. food response and suggests methods for improving DR for future emergencies. An opening section presents a history of past and present DR efforts and the prospects for implementing successful future programs in the face of an increasingly difficult world economic, environmental, and political situation.  Given that disasters often occur across national borders or in ""unfriendly"" countries, the political aspect of DR (including management issues and the level and mode of emergency famine assistance) weighs heavily. In response to this, the report recommends that an international task force, composed of African and donor representatives, be created under the aegis of the World Bank.  Plans are presented for gaining the necessary legislative and economic (including supplemental funding) support for DR.  Methods for utilizing and/or upgrading existing early warning systems (EWS's) to better anticipate emergency situations are given and recommendations are presented for:  integrating national EWS's; defining the role of host governments; using EWS's in development programs; and evaluating EWS projects.  Because the U.S will probably play a key role in future DR programs (as it has done in the past), attention is given to which management structure the U.S. should adopt.  Recommendations are also given for managing assistance to refugees and coordinating the inputs of other agencies. A thorough review and detailed recommendations for implementing DR programs is given including logistics and transportation, and the coordination of donor activities.  Much of the implementation of past DR programs has been dependent on PVO's which, because they are in the field, play a large role in disbursing relief goods.  Recommendations are given for maintaining good relations with the public and Congress, both of which provide important DR support.  Because emergency relief is, by nature, short-term, methods are given for turning DR into recovery and eventually development efforts; ways of doing so and the roles of donors and host governments comprise the subjects of the final chapter.","In: US response to the African famine, 1984-1986, v. 2","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Disaster relief|Famine early warning systems","Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL083.pdf","196 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","003433 - USAID.

"Evaluates OPG to Pan American Development Foundation (PADF) to implement an integrated rural development project in Honduras' Bay Islands (Roatan, Guanaja, and Utila).  External final evaluation covers the period 1/83-5/86 (prior to the project's 5/31/86 end) and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project staff and beneficiaries. The project's implementation arrangements reflected its complexity. PADF implemented the project with help from VITA, the local Asociacion Pro-Desarrollo de las Islas de la Bahia (APRODIB), and the National Water and Sanitation Service (SANAA). During the project's initial emphasis on the water supply (WS) component, PADF left management in the hands of the onsite project director seconded from VITA.  PADF involvement later increased under the auspices of the new APRODIB Executive Director. The project achieved most WS objectives (although sustainability of some of the systems is uncertain), all of its small business development (SDB) objectives, and many of the objectives relating to the institutional development (ID) of APRODIB, although in the latter case much remains to be accomplished.  The health and sanitation education component never had verifiable objectives, and its impact is unknown. APRODIB, originally the development committee for Roatan, where most of the project's activities have taken place, has ambitious plans to expand the SBD program and to expand existing WS systems in two of the larger towns.  With these plans in mind, the following recommendations are made. (l) WS:  Hire an engineer skilled in planning, building, operating, and maintaining rural and small-town water and sewage disposal systems; obtain agreement on contracting from the Municipality of Roatan.  (2) SBD:  Separate the loan program from all other operations; adopt the financial and decisionmaking structure of a financial institution; and add a formal training and TA component, even though operating costs may increase.  (3) ID:  Restructure APRODIB into 4 cost-centers (development finance, water and sanitation, administration, and other projects); change membership to sponsorship; and submit revised proposals for external funding. Two general lessons learned are that:  (1) integrated rural development projects may be more difficult to staff, equip, and implement on an island than elsewhere; and (2) two organizations working as partners need to have a clear understanding of each other's strengths and weaknesses, as well as the difference between institutional development and the implementation of field (productive) projects. Detailed analyses of, and lessons learned from, each of the four components are included.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Integrated regional development|Water supply structures|Sanitation engineering|Small scale enterprises|Private sector|Institution building|Private voluntary organizations|Beneficiary interviews","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU780.pdf","3,200 KB","000933 - Yale University.

"Evaluates A.I.D.'s participant training program in Haiti. External evaluation covers the period 1972-11/86 and is based on 200 questionnaire responses from and 62 interviews with returned participants (from a universe of 288 of the 395 participants trained) and interviews with Haitian and USAID/H officials. Most A.I.D. participants are sponsored by government ministries, typically for short-term (ST) U.S. training in health, management, and agriculture.  The smaller percentage of centrally funded training includes standard programs in management and health and regional scholarship programs.  Most participants are male, but the number of females has increased in recent years. Intra-USAID/H communication regarding training opportunities is weak and coordination with other donor programs poor.  Problems have been encountered in finding qualified candidates. Participants have generally not been involved in the selection process or in planning their programs - long-term (LT) and private sector participants have been more so.  Most participants have been well informed of administrative details, but less well briefed on technical matters and on the culture of the country of training (less than half of U.S. trainees and a single third-country trainee received orientation upon arrival).  Still, the majority received adequate administrative support and experienced no serious problems, although a number of housing problems were reported, especially by females, and several trainees stated that they would have benefited from better English skills. Most participants are highly satisfied with the quality, relevance, and level of their training.  Satisfaction varies according to field, with management trainees reporting the greatest and engineering trainees the least.  In addition to the benefit of specialized knowlege, participants reported significant changes in their professional attitude; supervisors have noted their increased discipline and motivation. Most LT and a surprising number of ST participants had no job upon their return.  Nevertheless, most are in a training-related job, and despite poor working conditions and limited administrative support, almost half claim to be successfully introducing new ideas and changes in their jobs.  Many have received advancements and increased responsibility due to training (women reported proportionately fewer such increases than did males); LT training appears to have had a greater impact on promotion than has ST. Establishment of professional and social contacts has been a program benefit; many participants are corresponding with their training institution or a professional contact made during the program.  Almost all welcomed the idea of an alumni association.","Prefaced by evaluation summary|Title supplied by cataloguer|Attached to PD-AAU-789","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Participant program administration|Participants|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAU789A.pdf","4,894 KB","008554 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Commodity Import Program (CIP) component of a project to help the Government of Mozambique (GPRM) revitalize private sector food production.  External evaluation covers the period through 11/86 and is based on document review and interviews conducted during field visits. CIP foreign exchange has enabled the GPRM to purchase critically needed agricultural inputs and equipment (seeds, fertilizers, farm machines, hand tools, ox-drawn equipment, trucks, spare parts, fuel) for distribution to private commercial, family, and cooperative farms in Maputo Province (especially in the Green Zones) and the Chokwe and Xai Xai districts in Gaza Province. The CIP continues to be private farmers' major supplier of inputs, has helped increase both food production (vegetable production alone has increased 38%) and food supply in its target areas, and has given novice farmers the opportunity to demonstrate their ability to produce.  The CIP has also provided zinc sheets and raw materials for the manufacture of tires, hoses, irrigation pipes, and rubber boots to select private firms. Commodity procurement, shipment, and distribution were performed easily and on time, and the allocation system generally operated effectively, ensuring the availability of inputs to targeted groups as needed.  The use of private traders to distribute commodities has increased slightly. The A.I.D. Affairs Office in Maputo (AAO/M) has managed the project well, although increased secretarial support would lighten the administrative burdens on its Commodity Management Office and allow monitors more time in the field to collect data. Periodic visits by a farming specialist could help AAO/M make technical changes in the commodity mix, where appropriate. On the policy side, GPRM price liberalization initiatives made prices rise greatly at first, but as vegetables produced with CIP inputs came to market, prices began to approach true market value.  Prices are now higher than under price control, but the quantities of vegetables are also greater.  The GPRM's successful use of a surcharge to obtain approximately market value for CIP-financed farm equipment and trucks has led to surcharge application on other valuable goods not CIP-financed.  Finally, the GPRM continues to transfer resources (e.g., state-owned land) to the private sector. Overall, the project is achieving its objectives and has had the unexpected effect of influencing other donors to reexamine their state-farm oriented agricultural programs.  The demand for CIP commodities in target areas is great enough for at least the next 2-3 years to absorb the current $10 million funding level and even increased levels.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Commodity import programs|Private sector|Agricultural productivity|Food production|Agricultural inputs|Agricultural equipment|Food prices|Market economy","Mozambique","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU848.pdf","2,309 KB","008580 - USAID.

"Evaluates participant training component of a project to upgrade Pakistan's agricultural research capabilities.  Final evaluation covers the period 4/74-6/85 and is based on document review, a survey of returned participants and supervisors, and interviews participants and involved personnel. The training component met most objectives despite interruptions which included a project redesign in 1977 to emphasize in-country training and political violence in 1979 resulting in USAID/P staff reductions.  A total of 197 participants were sent abroad for advanced degrees or short-term nondegree training in agricultural research specialties.  The vast majority have returned to Pakistan and are employed in their sponsoring institutions; in fact, only 3% are known to have left government service. Several returned participants have made outstanding contributions in agricultural education, research, or extension, e.g., the development and release of improved grain varieties, the introduction of new varieties of apple trees in Swat, and the design of an M.Sc. curriculum in fisheries at the University of Punjab.  Many of the participants have voluntarily trained colleagues and/or communicated their expertise through seminars, publications, etc. Despite these achievements, there have also been a few problem areas. (1) Five participants did not perform up to expectations, possibly because they were ill-prepared for advanced degree work. Their training programs were altered (e.g., changed to a less demanding field, or from Ph.D. to M.Sc.).  (2) Only four women were trained, none in long-term degree programs.  (3) Although the two major training institutions - the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) - were highly rated by participants, there was an indication that recent CIMMYT training is not up to previous standards, perhaps due to a change of training officers. (4) Recordkeeping was incomplete due to a change of contractors for CIMMYT and IRRI in 1982 and to poor record exchange among contractors, USAID/P, and the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council (PARC).  USAID/P was not informed of the nominations of more than 92 short-term participants trained under the project. It is recommended that:  (1) the Pakistani government examine its personnel policy system vis-a-vis professional incentives (opportunities for career advancement, fair determination of job assignments, and a reward system); (2) a national agricultural research publication be developed to increase information exchange among returned participants and others; and (3) USAID/P receive proper recognition for its contribution to the training program, which has not been the case in the past.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Participants|Agricultural education|Participant program administration|Agricultural research|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU841.pdf","1,046 KB","008588 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to promote rural electrification (RE) in Pakistan. Midterm external evaluation covers a period through 6/86; is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel; and focuses on TA provided by PTAT, a consortium of U.S. and Pakistani engineering firms, to the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA). Progress on major planning documents has been unsatisfactory. The Institutional Improvement Plan (IIP), intended to serve as a blueprint for the evolution of WAPDA Distribution's evolution to self-sufficiency, reorganizes WAPDA along the lines of American ELectric Power but lacks an institutional analysis of WAPDA.  The GOP's delay in assigning WAPDA counterparts has also slowed WAPDA institutional development.  Likewise, a Technical Master Plan (TMP) for WAPDA RE efforts, while mobilizing outside funding, has not succeeded in translating aggregate expenditure levels into discrete projects.  The TMP also fails to take into account GOP demands that 90% of rural villages be electrified by 1990.  As a result, both plans lack GOP approval, and meaningful work in these areas cannot begin.  On the bright side, a superior though still summary IIP was recently developed by senior PTAT management, and a third planning document, a Comprehensive Power Distribution Training Plan, is an excellent tool for WAPDA manpower planning and has been approved by both WAPDA and USAID/P. PTAT has introduced many new techniques to improve WAPDA finance, management, procurement, customer service, and computer utilization, but except for management services these tasks are performed by PTAT for WAPDA, and the skills are not transferred to WAPDA personnel. Similarly, the installation of energy loss reduction (ELR) equipment has been hampered by unreliable data about the WAPDA system and has been primarily designed by PTAT engineers, with little participation by WAPDA. On the positive side, except for the Sister Utility Program all training activities are ahead of schedule, and the inauguration of phase 1 of the Guddu Gas Turbine Power Plant in 4/86 provided a badly needed increase of baseline power in Pakistan's national electrical grid. Major problems requiring immediate attention are:  (1) WAPDA's institutional problems (lack of institutional autonomy, overstaffing, overly centralized decisionmaking, profile problems stemming from allegations of illegal gratuities); (2) use of PTAT consultants as adjunct WAPDA and USAID/P staff; (3) lack of adequate involvement by WAPDA staff; (4) need to allocate more PTAT staff time to WAPDA institutional reform; and (5) absence of monitoring and baseline data collection needed to measure project progress.  Nine recommendations address these issues.","Companion project evaluation summary: PD-CAU-578","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Electrification|Rural development|Institution building|Energy planning|Electric power distribution|Project change","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU842.pdf","5,820 KB","001600 - Associates in Rural Development, Inc.

"Evaluates project to combat childhood communicable diseases in Lesotho.  Midterm external evaluation covers the period 6/84-6/86 and is based on site visits, interviews with project personnel and health workers, and document review. The project is basically well run and making good progress towards its goals.  Although the integration of project activities with primary health care activities of the Ministry of Health makes it difficult for evaluators to focus directly on the project, this decentralization of management is a positive step. The management skills (planning, budgeting, reporting, etc.) of upper level Basuto health managers need improvement, however. Findings for specific project components include:  (1) Lesotho's health information system, one of the best in sub-Saharan Africa, is nevertheless experiencing delays in data entry and processing which could undermine progress; also, data provided by health workers are not always complete and reliable, and there is a need to further educate professionals at all levels as to the uses of health information as a management tool.  (2) The Expanded Program of Immunizations (EPI) is well integrated into the National Child Health program.  Staff are well trained and vaccine stocks, sterilization techniques, and cold chain procedures are generally good.  Plans to increase full immunization coverage from the already high 65% to 85% are challenging, but feasible, given additional health education in urban areas.  A notable increase in measles during 1985 indicates the need for more training of nurses in recognizing and handling disease outbreaks.  (3) The diarrheal disease component has established oral rehydration therapy (ORT) units at several hospitals; targets for reducing in-hospital dehydration mortality will be surpassed.  ORT packets are also being distributed by the hospitals, clinics, and in some areas, traditional and village health workers. The success of health education efforts to increase ORT use will depend on development and promulgation of a national ORT policy.  (4) Although the project has focused more on training than on health education, an impressive start has been made on the latter, especially in preparing and distributing materials and in initiating radio broadcasts on EPI and ORT.  An intensive 2-year health education program (which includes mass media efforts and training of trainers) will begin in Fall 1986. It appears the project may be financially sustainable if revenues are increased by charging for health registration, selling ORT packets commercially, and charging small fees for well baby or sick baby visits. These steps are recommended, as is a 1-year project extension to allow fuller project integration into the primary health system.","Work order no. 15|Attachments: XD-JAE-607-A through XD-JAE-607-F|Document includes: PD-AAT-173, PD-AAU-029, PD-AAU-030, PD-AAU-035,|PD-JAE-034|Project title: Africa child survival initiative-Combatting|childhood communicable diseases (ACSI-CCCD)","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-4062-00","","9/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Child health care|Immunizations|Oral rehydration therapy|Measles|Diarrhea|Disease prevention and control","Lesotho","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDJAE607.pdf","29,292 KB","004864 - Westinghouse Public Applied Systems","","001554 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Combating Childhood Communicable Diseases (CCCD) project in Malawi.  Midterm evaluation covers the period 1984-10/86 and is based on review of project documents and survey data, visits to service facilities and other health institutions, and discussions with project related personnel. While it is impossible to demonstrate if the project has lowered morbidity or mortality among children under five or even (due to the lack of of time-phased plans) to determine progress in improving CCCD coverage, many improvements can be seen in the Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) and malaria/diarrheal disease control services. Great progress has been made in controlling diarrhea through oral rehydration therapy, now used in all hospitals and taught on an outpatient basis in all Ministry of Health (MOH) units.  Mothers are encouraged to use the treatment at home, and a formula for preparing a sugar-salt solution is explained to mothers in clinics.  The National Malaria Control Committee was reactivated in 1984 to develop malaria policy; numerous studies have been conducted on the resistance of P. falciparum to chloroquine and on problems of prophylaxis.  EPI services have been integrated into the MOH health care network.  National 5-year plans (1985-89) for EPI diarrheal disease, and malaria have been published. On the negative side, a shortage of personnel has limited MOH capability to implement CCCD services and forced it to make some individuals responsible for both training and supervision - not always successfully.  Permanent training facilities are being built in each national region.  Integrated MOH health information systems are being developed; reporting and sample surveys are conducted, and surveillance systems have been established.  A major mass media effort is being conducted through A.I.D.'s HealthCom project, although CCCD media efforts may be integrated into - and perhaps submerged in - a proposed centralization of all government media activities.  Creation of a health education civil service cadre has been proposed.  MOH operations research activities have been extensive and excellent, emphasizing basic areas (e.g., knowledge-attitudes practices, malaria treatment for special populations). Severe weaknesses in supply management, cold chain, and bacterial sterilization exist, but progress is expected in rationalizing the three supply services now used.  Financing problems have included MOH failure to submit budget plans, and USAID and MOH failure to pursue cost recovery and provide adequate accounting. As for project sustainability, prospects for the MOH to pay for maintaining CCCD services in the longer run are not promising. Recommendations include a 1-year project extension until 3/31/89.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-4062-00","","10/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Child health care|Disease prevention and control|Communicable diseases|Diarrhea|Malaria|Immunizations","Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU868.pdf","5,881 KB","004864 - Westinghouse Public Applied Systems","","008573 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to promote community-managed tree plantations in Madhya Pradesh, India, by establishing a Social Forestry Directorate (SFD) as an extension unit within the Forestry Department (FD). Second mid-term evaluation covers the period 11/83-12/85 and is based on site visits and interviews with project personnel and villagers. The project's basic premise is flawed. Panchayat (village) leaders are motivated by the existing political economy to seek short-term goals, whereas the project's aim - self-sustaining, local management of timber plantations - is a long-term prospect. Also, tremendous pressures are exerted on panchayat leaders by villagers who own cattle and want the proposed project areas for grazing land. It is very unlikely that the villages will ever manage the plantations totally on their own. Present institutional arrangements are a further constraint. The FD, from which all top SFD managers have been drawn, is not an extension-oriented agency. Moreover, the top SFD position has served as a revolving door for FD officials on the verge of retirement, while many of the lower-level personnel transferred from the FD to the SFD have limited qualifications for their jobs and little interest in them. SFD morale is low and a sense of direction is wanting. At present, SFD's extension services are strongest for private nurseries and, in a few cases, private farm and agroforestry activities. As currently managed, none of the plantations visited will become financially self-sustaining, although major changes in the attitudes and behaviors of the SFD and the Panchayats could improve the situation. Much work needs to be done by SFD to engage village authorities in the management of woodlots. To the extent that villagers are currently so engaged, it is through SFD's nursery and seedling distibution programs. Finally, the availability of quality land for social forestry represents a serious project constraint, due to competing claims for the land from other government offices, villagers, etc. It is recommended that SFD not establish many more plantations until it has (1) assured that sufficient land is available and (2) demonstrated panchayats' capacity for managing the plantations on a self-sustaining basis. Otherwise, alternative approaches to forestry in Madhya Pradesh may have to be examined. SFD itself should undergo a period of program reconceptualization, restructuring, and consolidation, making radical personnel and organizational changes as needed. Recommendations for specific problem areas are also given.","1st mid-term evaluation: PD-AAY-191","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Forestry|Reforestation|Agroforestry|Community participation|Beneficiary interviews","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU898.pdf","12,609 KB","008557 - USAID.

"Evaluates the impact of a project (8/79-10/84) to develop and apply nonconventional renewable energy technologies in rural Thailand.  Ex post evaluation is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project and other involved personnel and with beneficiaries. Most of the project's 14 components achieved their objectives, with existing or potential benefits that more than justify the project's costs.  Four components have already substantially benefited the welfare and economy of rural Thailand.  (1) Four microhydroelectricity installations were completed in isolated areas; villagers participated in constructing the micro-hydro plants and formed co-ops to run them, gaining considerable technical and managerial skills in the process.  As a result of this component, the Royal Thai Government (RTG) has increased its micro-hydro investments and a domestic industry to manufacture the necessary equipment has arisen.  (2) Woodburning and charcoal cooking stoves far more energy-efficient than the traditional model were developed, and several thousand have been sold.  The improved design has been adopted by traditional stove manufacturers, a new company has been formed to manufacture improved stoves, and village groups (most owned and operated by women) have been created to fabricate and sell the stoves.  (3) Over a million trees were planted in village woodlots in 7 provinces.  Spin-off impacts include more private plantations and amenity plantings and a new appreciation of the environmental value of trees. (4) The four Regional Energy Centers created under the project have been doing an excellent job of disseminating information on project technologies; workshops and training sessions have been held on improved cooking stoves and charcoal kilns and on planting and caring for seedlings in village and private woodlots. Five other components may have significant potential impacts on the rural and national economies:  the National Energy Information Center was successfully established; project support for the Energy Master Plan helped in developing economic models which have already been used in national planning; valuable data on fuel use and needs were collected in village surveys; more efficient charcoal production techniques were developed and improved kilns are being constructed by private producers; and useful solar and wind resource assessments were conducted. Even those components (water-lifting, biomethanation, solar thermal processes, biomass gasification and rice husk pyrolysis) which failed to meet their objectives provided valuable lessons for the future.  A series of recommendations are made to the RTG regarding future activities under each component.","Work order no. 7|Companion evaluation summary: PD-AAW-382","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0000-I-00-4105-00","","12/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Renewable energy resources|Alternative energy technology|Energy research|Rural areas","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU900.pdf","7,359 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates project to incorporate farming systems research (FSR) into the programs of Botswana's Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). External, mid-term evaluation covers the period 7/84-6/86. A broad FSR approach to identifying production constraints and to designing trials to test and demonstrate appropriate technology has been implemented.  Two teams of Batswana and expatriate FSR technicians are working in the Mahalapye and Francistown regions and have performed well.  Although field work has been complicated by low and unreliable rainfall, a large number of surveys and trials have been completed.  The teams should now focus on choosing key variables and defining a replicable FSR methodology. Training has been an important and successful component.  B.S. or M.S. training is being provided to 15 Batswana, several of whom have already returned to duties in the project or elsewhere in the MOA. Since programmed A.I.D. training funds having been exhausted, other funds, especially those committed by the Government of Botswana (GOB), should be sought vigorously to train as many research, extension, and planning specialists as possible. USAID/B support has been adequate and some procedures have improved much since the last review.  However, reimbursement procedures need to be streamlined and USAID/B should agree to fund participation in professional seminars and workshops.  The GOB has generally contributed as agreed (indicating its support of the project), but better housing and other benefits for Batswana FSR staff are critically needed to retain these competent and well-trained people in the project area. While FSR cannot easily be institutionalized at this time, its potential integration into ongoing research and extension programs has been advanced.  An important lesson is that national decisionmakers, and regional and district agricultural officers, must have a good understanding of how FSR can enhance the effectiveness of a research and extension system if they are to accept it. The evaluation team concurs with the recent project extension to 9/89 and hopes that the present contractor, Mid-America International Agricultural Consortium, will be able to continue through that period. For USAID/B action decisions, see the abstract of PD-AAU-907. The project has taught the need to:  (1) complement on-station with on-farm research in order to increase the currently low level of technology adoption; (2) have contingency plans when developing technology packages for countries with difficult soil/rainfall conditions; (3) inform MOA personnel of the FSR approach and include them in FSR activities; (4) adopt a team approach to research/extension and work with social scientists and commodity research specialists in FSR; and (5) improve research-extension linkages.","Attached to PD-AAU-907","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural extension|Institution building|Farming systems research|Agricultural education","Botswana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAU907A.pdf","2,560 KB","008516 - USAID.

"Evaluates project component implemented by the Overseas Education Fund (OEF) to promote community reforestation and fuelwood production near refugee areas in Somalia and to strengthen the Somali National Range Agency (NRA) and the Somali Women's Democratic Organization (SWDO). External final evaluation covers the period 12/84-12/86 and is based on site visits and interviews with personnel of, inter alia, SWDO, OEF, USAID/S, NRA, and other cooperating PVO's. In terms of employment provided and beneficiaries reached, the project more than achieved its targets. In only 2 years, OEF and its NRA and SWDO counterparts created a service-oriented extension/community education organization which operates at both refugee camps and villages in and near Hargeisa, and is managed mainly by local staff, many of whom are women. Project-trained male and female extension staff are actively promoting a range of forestry, conservation, and horticultural activities (beyond targets), and a local capacity to instruct additional staff is in place. The project's emphasis on helping refugees and villagers set up their own enterprises (e.g., fruit tree nurseries) has led several groups to develop small businesses on their own. Also, an encouraging number of unsolicited requests for advice, seedlings, and assistance (e.g., in establishing live fences or nurseries) were addressed. However, efforts to establish woodlots for fuelwood production were not successful because the NRA, unable to resolve traditional land use rights in the project area, could not provide OEF with good-quality land as agreed. Some 60-70 ha of woodlots were planted, but growing conditions are poor and survival rates are expected to be under 60%. As a result, two of the project woodlots are now being used as model natural resource rehabilitation sites, with encouraging first results. In all, some 270,000 seedlings were produced - about 50% of the unrealistic target, which was based on technically inaccurate spacing criteria for plantings in arid areas. About 80,000 of the seedlings were used for amenity plantings around compounds and in public places and these are doing well. Construction is far behind schedule due to, inter alia, delays in receiving funds and lack of cooperation from Somali offices, but more discouraging, in OEF's view, has been the lack of collaboration from NRA and USAID/S. The remoteness of the project area and the fact that OEF, alone among cooperating PVO's, does not have permanent in-country staff or a local headquarters in Mogadishu appear to have put OEF at a disadvantage. In sum, OEF has made impressive progress in a relatively short time and in a difficult situation. A continuation - with funding from other donors besides A.I.D. - is merited.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Reforestation|Firewood|Agricultural extension","Somalia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU896.pdf","2,696 KB","004297 - OEF International","","008604 - USAID.

"Evaluates commodity import component of a project to help rehabilitate Madagascar's agricultural sector.  End-use evaluation covers the period 4/85-11/86 and is based on a survey of direct and indirect beneficiaries and on interviews with Government of Madagascar (GOM) and donor officials. The project-provided infusion of foreign exchange and commodities in the Malagasy economy has successfully supported reforms instituted under the GOM's Public Investment Program (PIP). As a result of PIP reforms, farmers are more confident in the future of agriculture and are seeking means to increase crop production. The timely availability of U.S. tractors imported under the project provides such a means.  All the Ford tractors already in-country are being used for agricultural production. In nearly every case, purchase of the tractors enabled farmers to work land which had lain fallow in previous years.  Employment has increased among the families of those well-off enough to buy a tractor, and new jobs have been created for others as well. Importation of Caterpillar spare parts has allowed important work, mainly in the private sector, to continue in road construction (41% of the value of spare parts) and in industrial agriculture and food production (26%), sectors especially targeted by the Project Paper (although the latter sector was dominated by parastatals). Beneficiaries of the commodity import program, apart from the GOM and the U.S. Government, include local private sector importers, U.S. manufacturers, participating farmers, parastatals, international and local private enterprises, and poor rural farmers and rural communities. These latter have benefited from increased employment, coupled with better access for their products through road construction and other civil engineering projects.  In the future, small self-help projects, using funds generated from the sale of commodities, could further help improve production and the quality of life in rural areas, and thus could help stem urban migration, which is occurring at an alarming rate. Adherence solely to short-term, bottom-line logic can lead to decisions that are economically sound but socially disastrous. In the short to medium term, it is likely that foreign exchange constraints will continue, and that further commodity import assistance specifically targeted to the agricultural sector could provide a sound base for economic recovery in Madagascar and further support the PIP.

"Evaluates project implemented by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Soil Conservation Service (SCS) to develop a soil taxonomy (ST) system to aid in the transfer of agrotechnology. External evaluation covers the period 10/79-10/86 and is based on a survey of participating Missions and institutions, document review, and interviews with project personnel. The project has succeeded in developing an ST which has become, de facto, the international soil classification system and in engendering wide awareness of the ST's potential uses.  The support given to International Soil Classification Committees (ICOM's) in their work of revising and expanding the ST to adequately cover tropical and subtropical soils has been especially significant.  Training forums, another important activity, have been well-received and included a high proportion of cost sharing. The project has also produced several important byproducts, including the provision of soil classification data for the World Benchmark Soil Project (WBSP) -  a misnomer for a soil-crop yield data base - through which SCS's National Soil Survey Laboratory (NSSL) collects and analyzes soil samples.  As a result, the project now has one of the most comprehensive collections of representative world soils which are, in turn, used by the International Benchmark Soils Network for Agrotechnology Transfer (IBSNAT).  However, despite the overall high quality of NSSL work, the soil-crop yield data base needs further development - it contains very limited crop yield data and virtually no climatic data; it is not very user friendly; and it lacks spatial data. This should be the major priority for Phase III of the project, which will begin in FY88 and focus on the use of ST in soil management. The TA provided by SCS has been generally of high quality, timely, and well-targeted.  The project has developed an impressive number of ties to international institutions, and International Agricultural Research Councils (IARC's) are increasingly using SCS services despite their general commodity orientation.  A.I.D. Missions also have expressed general satisfaction.  However, there are several areas of concern.  Most notable is the less than expected level of demand for TA and its ad hoc nature. Other problematic areas include coordination with other soil and water activities, and timely and effective involvement in the planning and implementation stages of related bilateral country projects. In sum, the project has addressed important soil management problems in a very cost-effective manner.  Much remains to be accomplished however, and its overall approach requires some adjustment.  In this vein, recommendations are provided for Phase III and the remainder of Phase II.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","BST-1229-P-AG-2178","","10/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Soil research|Classification|Technology transfer|Soil management|Technical assistance|Databases|Beneficiary interviews","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU927.pdf","3,214 KB","001433 - U.S. Dept. of Agriculture.

"Evaluates contract with the Marine Systems Laboratory of the Smithsonian Institution (MSL/SI) to test the commercial viability of culturing the Caribbean spider or king crab, Mithrax spinissosimus in Antigua.  External evaluation covers the period 4/85-1/86 and is based on site visits and interviews with project personnel. The project's crab culture system has not yet been shown to be either technically feasible or economically viable.  First, very little experimentation has been carried out to test the effects of variations in environmental parameters on crab growth, survival, and hardiness; these factors will have be addressed in order to arrive at the optimal system of spider crab culture. Second, although several groups have raised the crabs from the egg through the larval stages to adults as large as 200-250 mm in carapace length, no crabs have yet been raised to market size. Some crabs may be raised to commercial size within a few months, but this still will not guarantee profitable commercial culture, as it must be demonstrated that the project system is able to raise crabs to market size repeatedly and predictably.  Third, an economic analysis based on input parameters and the estimated annual income of local farmers indicates that, for a capable fisherman, the project technology would not be profitable. A.I.D.'s alternatives are to either close-out the project, while continuing to monitoring MSL/SI progress at non-AID sites (Turks and Caicos Islands and the Dominican Republic), or to provide continued and intensified support.  The second option, while riskier - the chance of commercial application within another 2 years is only about 20%, and within 5 years only 50% - is preferable, given the high quality of Mithrax meat.  It is recommended that a highly talented research team be secured to continue after MSL/SI leaves.  The team should not only test the present system, but should develop a fundamental understanding of Mithrax crab mariculture by conducting experiments that will provide information on how growth and survival rates are affected by such variables as feeding rates, cage stocking rates, temperature, cage incubation depth, etc.  Additional funding of approximately $500,000 and a 2-year project extension will be required.  If the project does not show good progress after this extension, it should then be terminated.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Aquaculture|Crabs|Pilot projects","Antigua and Barbuda|Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU941.pdf","4,581 KB","002290 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase agricultural and forestry production in Bolivia's Chapare region.  External evaluation covers the period 1983-9/86 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with involved personnel. Implementation has been impeded by several factors.  The project design is overambitious, too inflexible for the difficult Chapare environment, and premised on the control of coca production - which was only achieved in 7/86, nearly 2 years after start-up. USAID/B's failure to assign sufficient management resources has, along with long delays in procurement, permitted or exacerbated administrative problems among the Bolivian implementing agencies. Also, Chapare lacks basic infrastructure and most project offices are perforce in Cochabamba, 180 km from the project area. Lack of coca control has made it impossible to implement some components, while progress in other areas has been slow because objectives were not clearly conceptualized and translated into an aggressive course of action.  Stronger TA from the Experience, Incorporated team would have improved the development of technological packages.  For example, cropping systems improvements have been neglected, even though Chapare farmers typically practice multiple cropping; more attention to annual-perennial intercropping is needed. Also, livestock activities should be eliminated; the region is not suited to cattle production, nor have farmers shown interest.  The Chipiriri research station is located in an area ill-suited for agricultural production and atypical of most of Chapare; research on citrus and field crops should be transferred.  Recruitment and training of promoters has proceeded well but deserves even greater attention since there is no assurance that research and extension will continue after project completion; publication of research results for promoters is essential. Marketing and related activities are far behind schedule. Virtually nothing has been done under the market services component, only 3 industries have been identified under the large agro-industry component and none would have significant impact on Chapare incomes (this component should be deleted), and no substantial progress has been made in small agro-industry development.  Few farmers have access to the credit needed for the commercialization of crops requiring processing, such as coffee, and no formal credit delivery system exists. Project staff have been able to gain farmer confidence because the project has not been openly associated with coca eradication; this distinction should be vigorously maintained.  Also, if coca control is not sustained, project funds should be reprogrammed into activities to reduce migration pressure into the region.","Loan no. 511-T-067|Companion project evaluation summary: PD-AAV-552","Special Evaluation","Documents","511-0067-C-00-6130-00","","9/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural production|Agroforestry|Regional development","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU942.pdf","2,356 KB","005072 - Tropical Research and Development, Inc.","","008515 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ) monitor groundwater conditions near the newly constructed Aqaba wastewater treatment facility.  Initial external evaluation covers the period through 5/86 and is based on site visits, the collection and testing of groundwater samples, and interviews with project personnel. Good progress is being made.  Six of the eight planned monitoring wells have been drilled in the recommended areas and additional drilling is underway.  The wells are more than adequate for monitoring.  None of the wells has yet been developed or stabilized, but this will be undertaken soon.  Grab sampling has been conducted at all wells; improved procedures are needed for consistency in sampling, transportation of samples, and recording of data.  Nonetheless, the limited sampling and testing performed to date indicate fairly conclusively that the Aqaba wastewater plant is located above a mixing zone of two very different (qualitatively and quantitatively) aquifers, Wadi Aram and Wadi Utam. WAJ central laboratory facilities are well-equipped and well-staffed and include a new bacteriological unit.  The facilities appear to be fully capable of performing all required testing.  Also, WAJ has cooperative relations with the Royal Scientific Society's lab.  Three district labs are being planned, primarily for bacteriological testing; one of these will be located in Maan. With start-up of the Aqaba plant immiment, it is recommended that: (1) WAJ complete the construction of monitoring wells and immediately conduct sampling and testing to obtain baseline data on the aquifers; (2) the quantitative and qualitative configurations of the mixing zone of the Wadi Atam and Wadi Utam be carefully established using modern tracing and modeling techniques; (3) TA and training be integrated with other programs, especially with training conducted by the Aqaba construction contractor, and groundwater monitoring be integrated into overall plant process monitoring.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Waste disposal|Wastewater|Groundwater|Water contamination|Environmental monitoring|Baseline studies|Limited data","Jordan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDCAR170.pdf","502 KB","000186 - USAID.

"Provides final Mission report (8/80-12/84) on a pilot project, implemented by the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) with help from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Soil Conservation Service, to conduct water management research in Pakistan. Project targets for generating and publishing research documents and for applying new techniques and methodologies were met.  The project completed 23 research studies in six different technical areas: watercourse improvement management; water, soil, and crop management; extension of water and crop management; economics of water and crop management; groundwater management; and tubewell operation, maintenance, and management.  The studies, which were conducted both at the Mona Reclamation Experimental Station and on farmers' fields, received wide recognition and acceptance both within and outside of Pakistan.  The most important research accomplishments were to increase official awareness of the problem of watercourse conveyance losses and to develop suitable techniques for reducing these losses.  The project also evaluated field application losses and the effects of land leveling thereon, and established the fact that crops suffer from both over- and under-irrigation. Findings were disseminated to farmers through printed pamphlets in the Urdu language.  As a result of such dissemination, the production of gypsum for use on saline, sodic soils has increased to more than 3,000 MT a day in Punjab, an indication that farmers are realizing the utility of gypsum for reclaiming saline soils. The project played a major role in developing the Water Management Research Component of A.I.D.'s Irrigation Systems Management Project.

"Summarizes attached Spanish-language evaluation (PN-AAU-955) of a project to provide potable water and sanitation systems in rural Honduras.  Evaluation covered the period 5/80-10/85 and was based on site visits, document review, and interviews with involved personnel. The project has been unable to effectively coordinate activities of the 3 Government of Honduras (GOH) implementing agencies, mainly because no single GOH offical has overall authority.  An integrated implementation plan has never been developed, and independent planning by the 3 agencies has contributed to a fragmented approach at the community level and an overemphasis on construction, with less concern for promotion, health education, and proper water use.  The agencies also use different evaluation systems; some personnel are evaluated by two unrelated systems, and the information collected may not be shared. The project suffers from several other problems.  (1) Project-supplied water is not subjected to quality analysis. Regional laboratories are nonexistent, nor are there institutional norms to ensure periodic testing.  (2) The serious deterioration of existing systems shows the critical need for an operations and maintenance (O&M) program; activities to rehabilitate these systems will have only limited impact due to indecision as to the respective roles of the project and the GOH Office of O&M.  Water census data collected in 1985 (but not yet analyzed) should be used to define rehabilitation priorities. (3) There is need to review (a) the project's radio messages and other educational materials to ensure that they depict women as decisionmakers and beneficiaries in water use, and (b) procedures for selecting subprojects, especially to ensure that smaller and more remote communities are served.  Increased PVO participation could help reach these communities, but the project has not developed procedures for working with PVO's, only a few of which have been involved. In other areas:  (1) funds for training, evaluation, and TA have not been fully used (reassessment and re-allocation are needed); (2) lengthy and complex disbursement procedures have caused many delays; (3) establishment of design and construction standards has lagged, but a committee has now been named to do this; (4) responsibility for latrine construction should be given to one organization and promoters trained to situate and construct latrines; (5) the behavioral impacts of health education activities need more study; and (6) promotion and health education need strengthening to better mobilize community participation and proper water use. An additional $4.3 million in GOH funds will be needed to complete activities by the 12/87 PACD.","Attached to PD-AAU-977|WASH activity no. 210|Provides English-language summary of PN-AAU-955","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5942-C-00-4085-00","","6/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Potable water|Sanitation|Water supply structures|Host government departmental coordination|Health education|Rural areas|Limited data plus","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAU977A.pdf","7,932 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"Evaluates project (funded with local currency generations) to demonstrate the feasibility of contracting the private sector for road maintenance (RM) in Costa Rica.  External evaluation covers the period 11/84-8/86 and is based on document review, interviews with participants, and site visits and unannounced road inspections. The project has successfully demonstrated that RM by private contractors is both feasible and effective.  Physical results have been good and public reaction highly favorable.  Procedures for planning, contracting, etc. were generally well-conceived and professionally carried out, and relationships among participants and with contractors and local governments have been satisfactory or better.  Further, the Ministry of Public Transportation (MOPT) has shown new interest in RM alternatives and local capacities have been enhanced. Project administration by the Asociacion de Carreteras y Caminos de Costa Rica (ACCCR), a nonprofit organization, has been excellent. Similar arrangements in which private entities manage RM on public roads should work well elsewhere, at least in the short term, provided there is a suitable and willing entity. Some of the procedures used by ACCCR (e.g., shifting funds among subprojects - SP's - and the use of simplified, accelerated bidding and contracting procedures) probably could not be transferred to the MOPT, given its need for public scrutiny and multiple certification. A large pavement recycling SP conducted near the capital has been completed, while work continues on SP's to maintain and/or rehabilitate roads in central and southern Costa Rica.  The latter SP's experienced some problems in that their work programs were based on a prior RM study which was too general for application to specific roads and did not accurately define the amount of rehabilitation work needed.  Both SP's had to be scaled back and large amounts of ""cost-plus"" work were needed. However, high contractor productivity in routine activities compensated in part for these problems. The project's lessons include:  (1) RM and rehabilitation can probably be done more cheaply, and certainly more dependably, by contract than by government agencies, which cannot marshal the resources to perform work on schedule; (2) work programs for competitive bidding must be well-defined; (3) site surveys are needed for planning non-routine maintenance and for betterments; (4) despite efforts to make prior legal arrangements, problems arose with the host government regarding import duties and classification of grant funds; (5) contractual relationships must be carefully drawn, even in a maintenance demonstration, and even when the parties involved have a cooperative relationship; and (6) force account work by contractors should be avoided, and unit price work emphasized.","Attached to PD-AAU-979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Road maintenance|Privatization of services|Pilot projects|Contracting","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAU979A.pdf","966 KB","002203 - Wilbur Smith and Associates, Inc.","","008533 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to revitalize the Corporacion Costarricense de Financiamiento Industrial Internacional (COFISA) as a development-oriented financial institution in Costa Rica. External final evaluation covers the period 9/82-7/86 and is based on document and financial reviews and interviews with COFISA staff, clients, and bankers. The project has apparently achieved its objectives of bolstering Costa Rica's private sector and foreign exchange generation capacity and of re-establishing COFISA financially.  COFISA's direct impact on the Costa Rican economy will include a net inflow of roughly c2.4 billion, once the all the projects to which it has lent are at full steam, and generation of about c1.1 billion in wages, supporting some 18,000 people. COFISA has complied with project terms regarding lending limits, eligibility, and policies.  (Compliance is questionable in only one or two areas, e.g, structuring of some loans to comply with a requirement that 75% of loans be for a 3-5 year term).  It has booked high-risk, development-oriented loans, targeting dollars to nontraditional exporters; 75% of approvals were for developmental rather than commercial financing.  This combination of development lending and short-term, commercial lending will help COFISA diversify its income and offer more comprehensive banking services. With regard to lending process, significant advances were evident from the colon portfolio to the newer dollar portfolio, especially in the areas of project and credit analysis and documentation.  Collateral policies have been fairly liberal, thus contributing to real development lending where loans can be structured flexibly.  Up to now, however, emphasis in the dollar portfolio has been on credit initiation; more needs to be done in credit administration to increase control over the portfolio and allow early problem recognition. Structural changes (such as placing preferred stock, establishing a risk minimization fund, modifying accounting procedures and credit analysis techniques, etc.) to improve credit operations are progressing well, but much remains to be done in terms of bank operations and planning to permit COFISA greater viability as a commercial bank once it is chartered.  A lack of commercial banking experience at COFISA's senior levels aggravates this situation. COFISA's financial situation turned around remarkably over the past year as it was able to preserve significant equity during debt negotiations with external commercial banks.  It is now underleveraged by a huge margin, and its major challenge is to obtain additional debt. In short, COFISA's potential as a private bank is considerable, but adjustments are needed to permit greater flexibility in commercial lending and make future success even more likely.","Later ed.: PD-AAU-708|Attached to PD-AAU-980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Financial institutions|Institution building|Commercial credit|Development finance|Beneficiary interviews","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAU980A.pdf","10,062 KB","008533 - USAID.

"Evaluates project (1979-84) to demonstrate a photovoltaic (PV) energy system in Hammam Biadha, Tunisia, and to upgrade the capacity of the National Electricity and Gas Compnay (STEG) to plan and implement renewable energy projects.  Ex post socioeconomic impact evaluation is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel. Although the planned PV system is operational, the project achieved neither its economic nor its demonstration objectives. There is little evidence that economic activity increased due to the new system, or that the local farm economy approved.  The project's only employment impact was the generation of jobs for four STEG personnel (i.e., 3 guards and 1 operator). Socioeconomic impacts were also limited. Further, the system is neither covering recurrent costs nor amortizing any of its fixed investment costs.  It generates about $800 (equivalent) annually in revenues, while losing the equivalent of $13,000 per year.  Although data for an adequate cost/benefit analysis are unavailable, it is clear from the large initial investment, the large yearly operating loss, and the small number of beneficiaries - 25 families and 1 school - that the system's operation is uneconomical and represents an inefficient deployment of A.I.D. and Tunisian assets. Although the PV system gained wide publicity through informal demonstrations (i.e., visits by Tunisian and donor personnel), agricultural demonstration activities did not achieve the planned spread effects, perhaps because STEG, as an energy agency, was not very involved in developing agricultural applications. Technologies such as PV-powered drip irrigation and solar greenhouses were not adequately tested.  The Ministry of Agriculture would probably have been a better lead agency. Among lessons learned are that:  (1) the project as designed was really an integrated rural development  project in disguise, and, not surprisingly, suffered from a serious lack of institutional coordination; (2) agency roles and responsibilities should be carefully evaluated vis-a-vis project goals; (3) energy projects should not be an end in themselves and should therefore be evaluated in terms of how they can help other sectors, e.g., health; (4) better information dissemination, within countries and internationally, is needed for demonstration projects; (5) demonstration projects must include a framework by which change can be measured; and (6) host country social scientists should not conduct the social impact assessment of a project.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Pilot projects|Renewable energy resources|Agricultural technology|Demonstration|Photovoltaic energy|Electrification|Technology applications|Rural areas|Socioeconomic aspects|Beneficiary interviews","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDCAR710.pdf","1,394 KB","005086 - Resource Management Associates of Madison, Inc.","","008616 - USAID.

"Evaluates grants to America-Mideast Educational and Training Services, Inc. (AMIDEAST) to strengthen higher education and provide manpower training in the West Bank and Gaza.  External evaluation covers the period 1978-1/86 and is based on a review of AMIDEAST documents and literature on Palestinian education, and interviews with concerned Palestinian, U.S., and Israeli personnel. The Palestinian system of higher education is as advanced and balanced as any in the Third World, all the more remarkable since it has developed for the most part under Israeli occupation, without government financing or direction.  Palestinian universities vary in mission, history, and affiliation, but all seem to have the residents' support. The universities enjoy a measure of self-governance despite the military occupation and they have substantial linkages with Arab countries, especially Jordan. Nonetheless, the outlook remains uncertain.  Institutional planning is weak, many of the universities having been established only in the past 20 years.  There is no one authority responsible for planning and coordination - the Council for Higher Education, established in 1977, has not developed into such an agency.  The universities' orientation and atmosphere are influenced by the military occupation, and educational leadership has been weakened by Israeli policies of banishment and by recruitment of administrators with little experience. Financial viability will be problematical if external assistance - the universities' main source of income - is interrupted. Employment for graduates is another concern.  While the institutions are likely to attract and absorb greater enrollment, the territories' economies cannot sustain the manpower. AMIDEAST has excellent relationships with the universities and has managed the grant-funded Faculty Development Program well. As of 4/85, 240 faculty members have received U.S. graduate scholarships; 95 returned to teach, 10 withdrew, and 135 continue to work on their degrees.  Most participants did well academically and the selection of institutions and fields of study has been excellent (although more doctorates are needed in engineering and business).  More than one-third of all Palestinian faculty are U.S.-trained, a ratio which will increase over the next 3 years.  A.I.D. has also funded:  undergraduate scholarships totaling some $1.4 million (only a small percentage of total student fees) at West Bank universities; short-term training for some 100 participants (there is some confusion among U.S. PVO's regarding AMIDEAST's responsibilities in this area); and two applied research projects. Several specific recommendations are made for continued A.I.D. support, through AMIDEAST, to Palestinian universities.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-I406-I-00-4052-00","","1/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Educational development|Institution building|Universities and colleges|Beneficiary count","West Bank|Gaza Strip","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDCAR932.pdf","1,982 KB","000223 - Academy for Educational Development, Inc.

"Evaluates project to help Senegal's National School of Applied Economics (ENEA) develop curricula in project management (PM). Midterm external evaluation covers the period 1982-4/86 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with project and ENEA personnel, trainees, and rural people. The project has made significant progress in establishing within ENEA a continuing capability to provide management training. Project achievements include:  (1) the development and implementation of courses for ENEA staff and students in PM, marketing, teacher training, and research; (2) long-term training of 10 ENEA assistant professors at Texas Tech University; (3) the design and implementation of an in-service training program for officials and field agents of client agencies; (4) pilot project efforts in nonformal education (NFE); and (5) applied research projects as part of an overall evaluation and monitoring system. The project is at a critical point in several areas, however. Despite the development of PM courses, more work needs to be done to fashion these into a coherent curriculum.  Further, project personnel have been unable to fully involve ENEA faculty in the course development process, causing potential problems with future institutionalization. Misunderstandings about the source of per diem payments to participants has held up the in-service training program; follow-up has also been poor in this program. Finally, a 3-week summer training program at Texas Tech has stretched already tight financial resources and is of dubious value. Despite the appropriateness of its education/training emphasis, the project shows how problems can arise when a part of the project - in this case the NFE component - is isolated from the TA team.  It also teaches the importance of involving project beneficiaries from the beginning in order to avoid unrealistic expectations. It is recommended that the project tighten its focus and develop more pilot projects in NFE and in-service training.  To ensure ENEA's long-term institutional survival (enrollment has been declining due to a Senegalese austerity program), more long-term participant training should be provided, especially to increase research capacities. Finally, A.I.D. should note that ENEA is capable of providing high-calibre training to students and professionals from other African nations.","Work order no. 1","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1096-I-00-4165-00","","4/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Management education|Teacher education|Management training|Curriculum design|Nonformal education|Education for development|Development project management|Beneficiary interviews","Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAV021.pdf","1,602 KB","001690 - Development Assistance Corp.","","008600 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the Government of the Ivory Coast (GOIC) complete minimum standard shelter projects in several secondary cities. Initial external evaluation covers the period through 2/86 and is based on document review, site visits, interviews with project staff, and a questionnaire survey of GOIC officials. Despite a long delay in start-up, the project has provided work to both the public and private sectors during a period of economic crisis and is now generally making good progress.  Work is underway or about to begin in 9 of the 12 original cities, and should be completed by the end of 1986.  Infrastructure upgrading has begun in 7 of the cities - there are some design faults in Vavoua (these are being corrected) and some maintenance problems in Issia which so far have escaped the concern of local authorities - and work on community facilities is underway in 8 cities, and complete in 3.  The sites and services component has been reduced in scope and suffers from delays; nonetheless, 1,941 lots have been laid out in 3 cities and beneficiary selection has begun. Another 4 cities have been added to the project (with work due to be finished by the end of 1987); work in these cities will build on experience gained, emphasizing an integrated, interministerial approach to planning and implementation.  Also, cost recovery mechanisms are being developed or are in place and progress is being made on simplified cadastral surveys.  The project's small loans component has not begun, and will probably have to be eliminated as planned interest rates are not allowable (too high) under the GOIC's agreement with the West Africa Monetary Union. The financial and project management techniques of the involved agencies have improved.  In one instance, a failed plan to install data processing equipment purchased with escrow interest earnings in one agency was successfully transferred to another. Still, interagency coordination must be improved; the Ministries of Public Works and of Interior are vying for lead responsibility for implementation.  Also, frozen GOIC budgets have affected staff morale and institutional growth, and project monitoring has been restricted due to inadequate travel budgets and a lack of vehicles.  Low physical design standards, while understood, have raised technical questions and should be reviewed, especially for road paving and drainage where maintenance and citizen education are poor. Key lessons learned are:  (1) shifting political and economic environments offer opportunities for policy initiatives at times which might otherwise appear unconducive to such efforts; and (2) a combination of flexible project design, considerable regional automony for RHUDO, and creative resources are needed to take advantage of such opportunities.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Housing investment guaranty|Urban development|Secondary cities|Minimum shelter housing|Limited data plus","Ivory Coast","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAV067.pdf","1,678 KB","004612 - Technical Support Services, Inc.

"A 7-person, interdisciplinary team conducted a final evaluation of A.I.D.'s Rural Water Supply Project in Burkina Faso, which lasted from 1980 to 1986; emphasis is on the 1984-86 extension period. The project reached most of its objectives and may generally be considered a success.  Its construction of 678 wells has significantly increased the availability of water; project continuation is recommended so that remaining water needs may be met.  The success ratio in constructing wells with acceptable yields improved over time, exceeding 90% for both drilled and hand-dug wells during the last campaign. The Moyno pump employed by the project has been moderately successful in avoiding breakdowns; however, comparative tests indicate that other pumps may be more suitable to Burkinabe conditions.  The project's greatest failure was undoubtedly the lack of a functioning system to maintain the pumps.  A new, innovative maintenance system which relies on the private sector has recently been formed, but is not yet in operation.  Periodic evaluation of the maintenance system is recommended. While the project's combination of a water component with a health component was innovative, the two components have not proceeded in tandem, the latter having been operational only for the last 2 years. Interministerial coordination improved markedly during the extension period with the naming of a technical coordination committee composed of two technical directors and a team leader from Dimpex, the technical assistance contractor.  The addition of a national director to oversee all project operations is recommended. A random survey found that sanitary storing and use of water was not common among villagers.  Distance to the water point, irrespective of water quality, continued to be the overriding factor determining water use.  Within a pilot zone established to test an integrated water and health approach, results were somewhat better.  In the future, health education and village extension (animation) should precede well construction. Unit costs of well construction were rather high; future projects should utilize the private sector for drilling wells.  Efficiency could also be improved if wages were based on production. The management systems established by the project are appropriate and constitute a model for other development projects of this kind; more attention should be given to their application, however.

"Evaluates project to establish an integrated pest management (IPM) capability in eight Sahelian countries.  External evaluation covers the period through 3/86 and is based on interviews with project personnel, document review, and visits to each country. The project has made substantial progress following a 1983 redesign which, to a large degree, eliminated the serious management problems experienced earlier.  It has helped make national governments aware of IPM's potential benefits to long-term production planning goals and has shown extension agents, as well as the farmers participating in pilot projects, the benefits of rather simple crop protection methods. Great strides were made in developing local research capacities. For example, research networks were developed, and a necessary means of communication was provided through annual regional meetings; project studies have yielded methods (still in need of some testing) of controlling pests with little or no use of chemical pesticides; important research on loss assessment for millet crops attacked by Raghuva was conducted; surveillance systems are functioning in all countries, although with difficulties in some; the development of prediction models for Raghuva and grasshoppers is nearing completion, needing only verification and fine tuning; bioclimatological data were collected through a network of observation and surveillance posts; and, most important, a cadre of young researchers were/are being trained in crop protection.  A total of 75 scientists are collaborating on the project against an original estimate of 10. All of the participating countries except Niger, Chad, and Mauritania should be able to continue crop protection activities without external support by the project's end in 3/87. Despite these successes, several problems exist.  Training and TA have focused on entomology to the neglect of weed control and plant diseases.  The provision of cheap or free pesticides by national governments and crop protection services may negatively affect farmer acceptance of IPM and should be reviewed; also, the use of high risk pesticides should be halted.  When possible, pilot programs need to be standardized; and a socioeconomist should be hired to advise on cultural aspects.  Those persons now in training will probably not have the advantage of on-the-job training by a project advisor.  The quality and availability of TA provided by the FAO was variable; the project would have benefited from short-term TA.  Project management still presents some difficulties, particularly on the national level. Collaboration and cooperation with other research groups, especially other A.I.D. projects, needs improvement - in the case of The Gambia, the lack of cooperation was intentional.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated pest management|Research management|Regional development|Agricultural research|Biology research|Crop protection","Sahel","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBE063.pdf","5,098 KB","000503 - U.N.

"Evaluates project to establish an agricultural university (the University Center of Dschang, or UCD) in Cameroon.  External evaluation covers the period from 6/82 to 11/86 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with involved personnel and participant trainees. Substantial progress has been made in several areas.  Revision of UCD's academic and administrative structures to achieve greater operational efficiency is essentially complete.  UCD has been divided into 9 departments, offering specialized degrees in crop and animal production, forestry, rural engineering, agribusiness, and rural education and extension.  In addition, curricula have been revised, resulting in the replacement of the 2-year Ingenieur Agricoles and Ingenieur des Travaux Agricoles degrees by a 4-year B.S. equivalent program. Progress in upgrading faculty and stimulating research and outreach programs has been good.  Thirty-five faculty members are pursuing graduate degrees at U.S. universities, 11 at the Ph.D. level; another 12 have been nominated for U.S. study.  Research and outreach programs have been hampered by a lack of suitable facilities and coordination with other government agencies, but progress is acceptable given the comparatively short time UCD has been in operation.  Expanded library facilities, creation of a new university-level outreach office, and a stronger presence on the National Committee for Plant Research, which coordinates government research efforts, are needed to make additional progress in these areas. More serious are the problems surrounding the development of three UCD demonstration farms:  lack of supervision and equipment have made these facilities almost impossible to use, a serious obstacle to creating a balanced research program.  Construction of other essential buildings (e.g., dormitories, classrooms) is about 2 years behind schedule, due primarily to poor planning and building design, and probably will not be completed when the project ends in 1989.  Efforts to establish a motor pool and physical plant maintenance services have been unsuccessful as well, due in part to lack of supervision, training, or adequate compensation. In sum, while the project has achieved significant momentum, about half of its outputs remain to be accomplished, and are in fact dependent upon completion of construction and further development of the research and outreach programs (which in turn depend upon the participants' return).  The project design allotted too little time for institution building and it failed to understand that the U.S. land grant model cannot be imposed in Africa.  It is essential that an indigenous model for integrating teaching, research, and outreach at universities be allowed to evolve.  Numerous recommendations are made.","Attached to PD-AAV-270","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Universities and colleges|Institution building|Educational development|Agricultural education|Agricultural research|Agricultural colleges|Beneficiary interviews","Cameroon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAV270A.pdf","2,753 KB","008524 - USAID.

"Evaluates rural electrification (RE) project in Bangladesh. External evaluation covers the period through 7/86, is based on site visits, and analyzes four project areas:  the RE management system; systems planning and engineering; RE tariffs and energy sector pricing policies; and TA. The RE management system has been extremely effective and the major administrative units have successfully carried out their basic objectives and major functions.  The Bangladesh RE Board (REB) has developed the distribution cooperatives (called Palli Bidut Samities - PBS's) to the point where the local personnel can carry out their primary duties.  More importantly, the REB has the engineering capabilities to carry out RE in Bangladesh. The competency of the engineering staff is quite high and the experience being gained by the system planning and engineering staff should greatly add to the decisionmaking capabilities of the REB and PBS's over time. The underlying economic soundness of the PBS's is improving as they mature.  Financial performance is generally strongest in those PBS's which supply relatively large amounts of power to irrigation and industrial customers.  However, it is likely that most PBS's will not be fully able to meet the current schedule of loan repayment and it appears unreasonable to require all PBS's to begin full repayment only 5 years after their organization. Repayment requirements should be tailored more specifically to the economic potential of the various PBS's. TA has been successful in building the REB and the PBS's into viable institutions.  As 12-15 years of TA are needed for an RE program, one can expect a continuing need for TA in Bangladesh, which began its program in 1978.  However, less TA is needed as each new phase is implemented.  A total of 20 advisors are recommended for the A.I.D. follow-on project, RE III, scheduled to begin in FY87.  Several specific recommendations for Phase III operations are included.

"Evaluates project to demonstrate and transfer nonconventional energy technologies (NET's) in rural areas of the Philippines. External final evaluation covers the period 12/81-6/86 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with project and other involved personnel. Despite early management miscalculations about the kinds of NET'S to be demonstrated and problems with equipment reliability and delayed funding, the project has been successful in reducing Philippine dependence on imported oil.  It has funded 26 subprojects (SP's), 16 of which are devoted to research and demonstration of NET's involving, e.g., solar and bioconversion, wind energy, hydropower, and cogeneration.  Some of the early SP's did not match well with local conditions or needs, but project management was flexible enough to adjust plans and correct early mistakes.  SP selections has become increasingly needs- (as opposed to technology-) driven, following a 1982 decision to emphasize the commercialization of NET's.  In all, 11 SP's have been completed, with progress generally good. The project's institution-building accomplishments are impressive, and include:  enhancement of the Bureau of Energy Development (a fledgling institution when the project began) and of other important energy research and education institutions; strengthened program management skills; and the design of new social arrangements and/or institutions for the management of NET's.  Promotion of NET's to the private sector has also been fairly successful, although much remains to be done in this area. Among the lessons learned are that NET projects should:  (1) conduct thorough background research - into the quality of TA, capability of the project implementor, effectiveness of the institutional arrangements, local sociopolitical conditions, availability of financing,  product cost and price, and acceptability of the product by end users - before committing funds for the demonstration of NET's in the field; (2) adopt a needs-driven approach to technology development (which should be viewed in the context of the community development); (3) research and pilot-test NET's before attempting field demonstrations; and (4) document and disseminate the results of NET demonstrations. Also, rural projects require sensitivity by implementors to local needs, as well as local participation in project planning and implementation. For USAID/P's summary of the evaluation and its consequent action decisions, see the abstract of PD-AAV-410.","Attached to PD-AAV-410","Special Evaluation","Documents","492-0249-C-00-6057-00","","9/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Alternative energy technology|Technology transfer|Rural areas|Energy research|Small scale energy systems|Cogeneration","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAV410A.pdf","5,017 KB","005137 - SITECH Resources Group, Inc.","","004669 - Philippines.

"Evaluates project implemented by the Tropical Agricultural Research and Training Center (CATIE) to develop and implement regional integrated pest management (IPM) strategies in Central America/Panama.  Mid-term external evaluation covers the period 7/84-12/86 and is based on site visitation, interviews with project personnel, and document review. Despite the project's extreme complexity, valuable progress has been made.  The project is a high-priority activity for CATIE, A.I.D., and national institution officials.  A dedicated staff has been assembled and has worked successfully in improving national and regional IPM capabilities.  Initial pest inventories for each country have been performed, and a wide variety of studies have been undertaken.  Good progress has been made in meeting goals for short-term in-country training in all countries. Technical cooperation among the many participating agencies has been adequate, but this aspect, and planning as well, have suffered from delays that occurred during project start-up.  The diagnostic laboratory at CATIE is operational, but not adequately equipped; similarly, development of a pest reference collection has been satisfactory, but would benefit from more collecting trips. The project needs to focus on long-term gains and on demonstrating to growers the tangible benefits of IPM research. Research has lagged behind training and TA and has been too much directed toward controlling single pests; a more holistic approach is needed.  In addition, separate country and regional research plans should be developed and serious thought should be given to including a pesticide management component. In-service training has been an important function in all countries, but a standard curriculum and supporting course materials should be developed.  Academic training, despite fruitful relationships between some country teams and local universities, is behind schedule.  Part of the problem with both the research and training components has been lack of personnel; often these activities depend on central team personnel who divide their time between three or more separate jobs.  It is crucial that the specific role of the central team be specified. Problems in financial management and procurement have been the major causes of project delays (the latter despite good backstopping from ROCAP).  Information management and dissemination in particular have been hampered by slow procurement and by lack of personnel. A number of recommendations are made, including one to extend the project for another five years.","Work order no. 2|Companion project evaluation summary: PD-KAK-167","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0085-I-00-6097-00","","12/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated pest management|Agricultural research|Agricultural training|Regional development","Central America|El Salvador|Costa Rica|Panama|Guatemala|Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAV510.pdf","1,739 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"Based on in-depth interviews, client visits, and financial analysis, this evaluation of the Private Development Corporation of the Phillipines (PDCP) is part of A.I.D.'s reappraisal of its 30 years of experience in private sector initiatives. The PDCP, founded in 1963, was originally capitalized by an A.I.D. loan of P27.5 million.  Despite the adverse effects of inflation, devaluation of the peso, and constrictive government regulation of imports and interest rates, by the end of 1982 PDCP had provided assistance to 1,183 projects having a peso value of over P5 billion. This expansion is complemented by the fact that PDCP has retained a trouble-free loan portfolio and has benefited from continuity of management and very good in-house staff training. Problem areas have been in the diversity of the portfolio - originally, loans were made predominantly to large industry, although by 1983 small and medium industries were receiving more attention - and in the geographic distribution of the funds, which still go mostly to the central regions.  The local currency supply has been a problem as well, although PDCP's ability to tap the peso resources of the Industrial Guarantee and Loan Fund (a separate institution also established in part with A.I.D. funding) has alleviated the problem somewhat.  The establishment of a Central Bank credit line in 1981 also increased the supply of pesos from foreign currency loans for local expenditures. The PDCP experience points up several factors which A.I.D. should heed as it draws up a new private sector development policy.  For example, greater attention must be paid to analysis of the financial sector in recipient countries as a prerequisite to A.I.D. investment. Priority should be given to wholesaling rather than retailing financial assistance to the private sector. Finally, training and technical assistance should be part of every A.I.D. attempt to establish or strengthen development finance institutions.  Appendices include a statement of PDCP's current business policies and 28 tables of financial statistics.

"Evaluates project to strengthen and make self-financing the primary health care (PHC) systems of three cooperatives in the Department of Santa Cruz, Bolivia.  Midterm external evaluation covers the period 8/83-5/86 and is based, in part, on document review. The project has had a troubled history and is far from achieving its goals.  Irreconcilable differences among the three participating co-ops, although recognized during PID revision, were not adequately addressed in the Project Paper.  After a long power struggle over the ownership and control of PHC delivery modules (i.e., assets, personnel, and operations) - a struggle which began among the co-ops and later involved the emergent project Management Support Unit (MSU) - USAID/B temporarily assumed direct responsibility for project management, and then, in 9/85, it deobligated the project, eliminating any role for the co-ops, and reobligated it through a cooperative agreement with Management Services for Health (MSH). The 9/85 cooperative agreement introduced some important changes in the project, opening participation to virtually any community organization, while concentrating power in the MSU, which became a separate legal entity known as Proteccion a la Salud (PROSALUD). However, due to the haste with which it was drawn up and changes in key USAID/B staff, the 9/85 agreement retained some elements of the original design which had proven unsuitable and failed to reconceptualize other key areas, e.g., ownership of the modules, responsibilities for marketing activities and research, PROSALUD's long-term role, and the identification of preferred self-financing mechanisms. Notwithstanding these problems of conceptualization and the operational problems created by Bolivia's economic situation, PROSALUD, which is staffed with competent personnel, has been able to successfully screen several community organizations for their willingness to participate in and finance PHC services.  By 3/86 PROSALUD was delivering PHC services in two level III facilities and restoring a level II center for operation in 5/86. The project will not be able to meet its targets unless it is extended through 4/90; the extension should have two phases, the first to demonstrate the economic self-sufficiency of the PHC modules, the second to prove PROSALUD's self-financing capacity. Other recomendations are to:  determine PROSALUD's long-term relationship with the community organizations and set a schedule for MSH disengagement; make PROSALUD responsible for project research; improve marketing efforts; and reinforce health promotion at the community level.","Attached to PD-AAV-545|Evaluation period: 5-30 May 1986","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5927-C-00-5068-00","","5/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Economic self sufficiency|Cost recovery|Health finance|Private health care|Community health care","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAV545A.pdf","1,016 KB","002615 - John Snow Public Health Group, Inc.","","008515 - USAID.

"Evaluates two projects, a lead and a follow-on, to help the Government of Zaire (GOZ) establish community-based primary health care (PHC) in 100 rural health zones (RHZ's).  The evaluation (a final one for the lead project and an evaluation of strategy for the follow-on), covers 8/81-12/86 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with involved personnel. The project had considerable success in meeting quantitative PHC goals (but sometimes did not meet qualitative standards) and, while it played a major role in integrating national disease prevention and control programs into PHC, its success in attacking major health problems was mixed - e.g., family planning acceptance is low and measles remains a major problem in many regions.  Quantitatively, the project: (1) converted 220 curative dispensaries into full-service health centers; (2) trained personnel, ranging from 66% of targeted physicians to 167% of targeted traditional birth attendants; (3) capped 1,500 springs; (4) built more classrooms than targeted; and (4) promoted broad-based village sanitation programs which deserve to be continued. Sustainable health systems have been set up in many RHZ's, but the legal status of the RHZ's has not been established. Community involvement is excellent in many zones but the project needs to document changing zone tactics and examine basic issues of community organizing. Also, while the project is part of a national health information system, internal service record systems have not been standardized and annual zone reports were not given feedback. The effectiveness of project management varied.  The GOZ provided adequate financial and personnel support; in fact, almost half of the short-term advisors were local personnel.  However, supervision, financial and logistic management, and monitoring need strengthening at all RHZ levels.  Also, U.S.-made vehicles and bicycles - often long delayed - proved ill-adapted for rural use. Recommendations regarding Phase II are:  support the coordinating role of the National Health Foundation (FONAMES) and introduce planning tools to strengthen coordination among FONAMES, GOZ, and the project; train subregional medical officers in supervisory functions; upgrade the RHZ rehabilitation process and integrate FONAMES into the RHZ selection process; give high priority to upgrading GOZ field units for the environmental sanitation and water supply component; and use the cooperative mechanisms foreseen in the project strategy. The project shows that with the help of training, basic supplies, and capital items, RHZ operations may become self-financing. Also, PHC impact can be enhanced through collaboration with other community development activities and by equal insistence on quality and quantity.","Attached to PD-BBF-376","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Rural areas|Community participation|Disease prevention and control|Beneficiary count","Congo DR","","","008626 - USAID.

"Evaluates Combatting Childhood Communicable Diseases (CCCD) subproject (SP) in the Central African Republic.  External evaluation covers the period through 11/86 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with relevant project officials, especially those of the implementing agency, the Ministry of Public Health and Social Affairs (MOPHSA), and with other Government of the Central African Republic (GOCAR) and donor personnel. The GOCAR has developed an impressive, decentralized health care system consisting of maternal child health care (MCH), family planning (FP), and an expanded program of immunizations (EPI), and MOPHSA has devised excellent multi-year plans for integrating the three primary CCCD activities (EPI and diarrheal disease and malaria control) into this structure.  Nonetheless, there are many challenges to be overcome if the SP is to achieve its targets.  Perhaps the greatest of these is lack of sufficient resources i.e., professional personnel (especially nurses), health supplies, and vehicles for supervisory and training visits.  A second key need is to improve donor coordination.  At this point, only the EPI program has a budget (and it is behind schedule due to delays in receipt of Italian-financed inputs). Budgets for malaria and diarrheal disease control must be developed so that other donor assistance can be sought. while health care administration is strong at the central level, there is a need for closer cooperation in the planning and supervision of field operations between the MCH/FP and the preventive medicine/endemic disease directorates. Other key areas needing improvement are as follows.  (1) Immediate attention should be given to increasing available revenues by charging for health services.  AID/W and the Centers for Disease Control should provide TA and training in the financial management of receipts from users fees.  (2) The central health education unit is operating at only 25% of capacity and lacks the resources to produce and deliver needed radio/TV programs and training materials.  (3) Training of health personnel in national policies regarding the three CCCD emphases needs to be conducted and oral rehydration therapy demonstration and training should be established without delay.  (4) Funds for operational research have been underutilized. It is recommended that the SP be extended one year, to 1990. Included also are several recommendations addressing specific technical and management needs.","Work order no. 18|Companion project evaluation summary: PD-AAY-014|French ed.: PD-AAZ-617","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-00-4062-00","","11/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|Communicable diseases|Child mortality|Child health care|Immunizations|Diarrhea|Malaria|Oral rehydration therapy","Central African Republic","","","004864 - Westinghouse Public Applied Systems","","008526 - USAID.

"Evaluates the growth monitoring grading system developed by Catholic Relief Services (CRS) for use in its Title II/Child Survival Program in Indonesia.  Special evaluation is based on interviews and tests with sample beneficiaries and CRS counterpart personnel at 10 maternal/child health (MCH) centers at which the grading system is being pilot-tested. CRS has been experimenting with the grading system for about 2 years. The system was devised as a way of translating key growth indicators (age, weight) into a single number on a scale from 1 to 10 that would serve as an indicator of growth status. The grading system was found to be easily understood and used by both MCH workers and mothers, a major breakthrough given longstanding problems with the unintelligibility of the health progress card (the standard growth monitoring instrument in Indonesia).  Part of this success is due to the similarity between the growth status grade and the system of school grading, since acceptable health grades (roughly from 7 to 10) are similar to acceptable school grades. Further, 93% of parents were able to easily recall their child's current health grade, and about half could remember their child's grade 6 months ago.  Parents were able to do this regardless of economic status and, to a large extent, educational level. Fully two-thirds of the illterate mothers in the sample showed full comprehension of the system. Though unsystematic and anecdotal in nature, evidence also suggests that the system may be increasing demand for health services, since a low grade serves as a ""symptom"" of health problems to parents.  Grading accuracy, despite some confusion on the part of MCH workers about whether to round figures up or down, was found to be high. In addition to being an accurate measure of individual children's growth, the grade system also provides valuable data for monitoring program operations.  However, grade data should not be used to monitor the program's impact on community unless inter- and intra-community control groups have been previously established. Recommendations are to:  replicate the grade system in as many CRS counterpart centers as possible; use the parallel between growth and school grades more extensively in training MCH workers and in consulting with parents; develop a simple training packet in order to expand the range of people who can calculate grades; and seek ways of using the grades to more effectively monitor individual child growth.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title II|Growth monitoring|Health records|Child nutrition|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAV600.pdf","1,075 KB","008558 - USAID.

"Findings from a cost-efficiency and performance evaluation of some 2,700 photovoltaic (PV) systems in use in 45 countries are summarized. The report compares PV systems with conventional systems of similar output for five applications:  water pumping, communications, vaccine refrigeration, lighting and home power, and multi-use systems.  Data were gathered from technical reports, user questionnaires, and interviews with experts.  Major findings are as follows.  (1) The technical problems initially experienced with PV systems have been largely overcome and the majority of the systems have been well accepted by users on the basis of their reliability, independence from fuel, and minimal maintenance requirements.  (2) The greatest constraint on implementing PV systems in developing countries is lack of an established infrastructure to support training, maintenance, and repair. (3) PV systems (especially smaller ones) can be the least-cost option on a life-cycle basis, even though initial capital costs are high. Included are financial analyses, by application and system size, comparing PV and conventional systems under favorable and unfavorable financial assumptions.","DOE contract DE-AC04-76DP00789","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Photovoltaic energy|Energy costs|Electric power generation equipment|Water supply|Communications technology|Refrigeration|Electric lighting|Electric power|Cost benefit analysis","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX171.pdf","1,009 KB","005127 - Sandia National Laboratories","","004776 - U.S. Dept. of Energy.

"Presents executive summary of an attached mid-term evaluation (XD-BBG-519-B) of a subproject (SP) implemented by Africare to assist the Government of Rwanda (GOR) with Ugandan refugee resettlement and relief efforts near Lake Nasho.  Joint Africare/A.I.D./Ugandan evaluation covers the period 10/83-9/86 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with beneficiaries. The SP has made good progress, although its execution has departed from plan in several regards due to both external factors and changes in GOR directives.  Implementation began in 6/84 with a beneficiary population of 7,000 refugee Ugandan herders and 1,400 indigenous people. Africare (which, due to GOR insistence, was implementing the SP directly rather than serving in an advisory capacity) designed water systems, expanded veterinary services, began a tsetse fly control program, and implemented improved ranching practices.  However, in 12/84 some one-third of the SP land was reserved by the GOR for a sugar cane plantation and in 10/85 virtually all the Ugandan refugees (and their cattle) left Nasho and were replaced one month later by 2,500 repatriated Rwandans (virtually all farmers) who had fled southwestern Uganda in 1982 and had been living in refugee camps ever since.  Since these changes, Africare has:  (1) established the repatriated Rwandans in five villages, distributing residential parcels and 1.5 ha farm plots and supplying farm tools and seeds; (2) begun production of beans, sorghum, and sweet potatoes; (3) planted 70 ha of woodlots; (4) established two tree nurseries and two ranches for improved grazing; (5) begun construction of water systems, a health center, and staff and repatriate housing; and (6) set up systems of village governance. Most activities have been performed well and are functioning as intended; forestry, water supply, and tsetse control efforts have been particularly successful.  Veterinary and range management activities have been good, but their utility in the wake of the departure of the Ugandan herders is questionable.  Food production efforts, on the other hand, will require an accelerated and more intensive farmer training program to achieve self-sufficency by SP end. Collaboration among the GOR, Africare, and other donors (UNHCR, Caritas, and the Red Cross) has been excellent.  Less positively, Africare has been late in submitting reports to A.I.D. and the SP coordinating committee has not met frequently enough. For USAID action decisions, see the abstract of PD-BBG-519.","Full report: XD-BBG-519-B|Attached to PD-BBG-519","Special Evaluation","Documents","AFR-0422-G-SS-3071-00","","11/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Crop production|Animal husbandry|Refugee relocation|Refugee relief|Food production|Settlement establishment|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Rwanda","","","000235 - Africare, Inc.","","008598 - USAID.

"Evaluates pilot project to provide increased opportunities for Moroccan women to secure employment as skilled workers in the industrial and commercial sectors.  Ex-post evaluation covers period from 1979 to 1984 and is based on site visitation, interviews with beneficiaries, and document review. The project was extremely successful.  Working with the Ministry of Labor's Office of Technical Training and Job Development (OFPPT), the project recruited young women with at least 9 years schooling for training in existing MOL programs, primarily in drafting, electricity, and electronics.  Over the course of the project, 660 women were enrolled in industrial, construction, and commercial courses, but more importantly, the level of female enrollments in all OFPPT training courses has sharply increased. For example, the proportion of women enrolled in industrial courses doubled between 1979-80, nearly doubled again during 1981-82, and steady increases have followed.  Cost per trainee was low, between $3,138 and $4,367, depending on the amortization method used.  At the time of the final evaluation in 1983, 70% of all women graduates from pilot centers had been placed in jobs, and graduates interviewed said they were comfortable in their positions and respected by fellow employees and their families alike.  Although none had passed baccalaureate exams, they tended to earn as much or more than those in the public sector with baccalaureates. Although dropout rates and placement figures have not been strictly monitored by OFPPT, the consensus among graduates, instructors, and project personnel is that the dropout rate for males and females is about the same, and that the employment rate for OFPPT female graduates is much higher than for women with no vocational training.  The lack of reliable data on placement, salaries, and dropout rates, however, points up a significant problem, which was the OFPPT's inability to adequately monitor project activities.  Funds used for non-essential technical reports might have been better used for TA for developing and implementing a monitoring system.  Other problems with the project were the OFPPT's failure to provide dormitory space for the women and the fact that special entrance requirements for women were dropped by the end of the project. Nevertheless, future projects might use a streamlined version of this project design as a prototype for achieving great impact through relatively simple, yet significant, change.  Such projects might also benefit from greater emphasis on shorter term participant training and job placement components.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Female labor|Technical training|Vocational training|Employment|Private sector|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews|Economic development|Trainees|Pilot projects|Job satisfaction|Socioeconomic aspects|Training centers|Employment services|Management information systems","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAV867.pdf","1,212 KB","000616 - International Center for Research on Women (ICRW)","","008579 - USAID.

"Evaluates subproject (SP) to help the Haitian Development Foundation (HDF) in its efforts to meet the credit and management needs of Haiti's small business sector.  External evaluation covers phase four activities (9/84-12/86) and is based on a review of pertinent documents and financial records and interviews with USAID/H and HDF personnel and selected loan recipients. A.I.D. support has enabled HDF to moved from a state of near collapse to a level of satisfactory performance.  The most dramatic changes have come in the area of personnel.  Two years ago, Board members, management, and key staff were compromised by incompetence and charges of dishonesty.  Loan making had halted and HDF's reputation was weak. Today, the Board is composed of new members; the current Executive Director is firmly in control; capable key personnel are in place; new loans are being processed and granted; old loans, even some considered uncollectible, are being repaid.  HDF's reputation, among both borrowers and the financial community, is much improved.  In general, HDF is making a social and developmental impact.  Among the 8,000 Haitian micro entrepreneurs, HDF is almost a unique source of funds. HDF is not without problems; however, the Foundation recognizes its weaknesses and is taking steps to overcome them.  For example, HDF's management information system is inadequate, accounting and record keeping need upgrading, and loan processing is slow and not suited to a small loan size, large volume operation.  To improve these functions, HDF has installed a data processing system based on a personal computer; training on the system has already begun. Another problem is the need for TA in business management (e.g., bookkeeping, management methods) for HDF's borrowers.  A course is being offered for $150 (originally $300) by the Management and Productivity Centre (MPC) but cooperation between HDF and MPC has been lacking and the course has been little used. A.I.D. should continue to support HDF and encourage its expansion. Numerous specific recommendations to improve HDF performance are included.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","521-0181-A-00-4083-00","","10/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Financial institutions|Credit|Business support services|Microenterprises|Beneficiary interviews","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAV876.pdf","5,722 KB","000833 - Robert R.

"Evaluates the effectiveness of the National Cooperative Business Association's (NCBA - formerly the Cooperative League of the U.S.A) International Development Division (IDD) in utilizing A.I.D. Core Grants.  Evaluation covers the period 1/83-12/85 and is based on document review and interviews. Changes made by the NCBA at both the organizational and division level reflect the importance NCBA has placed on Core Grant activities and the Association's responsiveness to A.I.D.'s emphases on private sector and host government involvement in development activities.  On an organizational level, the NCBA has been restructured in order to better meet the requirements of its clients - an objective which is also mirrored in the organization's new name.  At the IDD level, an effort has been initiated to develop international trade opportunities for U.S. and foreign cooperatives, and a new position, Vice President for Food Policy, has been established.  The shift in the NCBA management approach as indicated by key personnel decisions has affected the policy and program direction of the organization. These changes have coincided with a dramatic increase in NCBA revenues (the dollar volume of NCBA international activities doubled from 1983 to 1985) and A.I.D. project involvement. Important factors in NCBA's successful implementation of Core Grant activities have been the sensitivity and awareness NCBA staff have demonstrated of client requirements, and the overall experience and expertise of the staff. NCBA has also functioned well at the operational level.  The Core Grant increased the production of feasibility studies and of proposals for host country cooperative development, and, during 1985, dramatically increased the number of host country site visits for project identification.  As a result, the level of AID-funded grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements has increased.  Although project implementation (backstopping) declined, this was in accordance with A.I.D.'s wishes and IDD's plans. Interviews with personnel involved in projects in India, Equatorial Guinea, and Niger indicated that the IDD staff provided excellent support, some of it under Core Grant funding. Activities in other areas either remained at a constant level (e.g., collaborative efforts with other cooperative development organizations) or constituted a relatively minor area of activity (e.g., training). Recommendations are made regarding future NCBA program emphases and funding sources.  Improvements in NCBA's evaluation structure are suggested.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABD-368","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-2257-C-00-6072-00","","11/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Cooperative development organizations|Development projects|Grants|Private sector|Organizational structure","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAV940.pdf","7,850 KB","002508 - MetaMetrics, Inc.|005268 - Adkins and Associates","","000165 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to encourage employment in the rural non-farm sector by providing analytical and financial services through a local NGO (the Micro Industry Development Assistance Society, or MIDAS) to small- and medium-sized enterprises in Bangladesh. External evaluation covers the period 9/81-3/86 and is based on document review and interviews with key project personnel. There has been a dramatic shift in emphasis in the MIDAS program from the original Project Paper to the revised Cooperative Agreement and amendments.  As a result, MIDAS' target beneficiaries have changed from small and micro producers to medium-sized enterprises, and its emphasis has shifted from employment generation and small sector industrial development to commercially-oriented business development.  This movement has compromised MIDAS' ability to reach women, since they tend to be the most ""micro"" of all producers. Nevertheless, MIDAS has been managed and administered in a responsible and competent manner, and has developed a reputation for fairness and honesty in dealing with client groups.  Its cash position is strong, and its accounting system and financial management policies are adequate (as shown by the comparatively low number of bad loans); however, the length of time required to process loan applications (6 to 9 months), due partly to MIDAS' status as an NGO, has discouraged some potential borrowers. MIDAS has also been very responsive to USAID/B's wishes in structuring financial activities in support of small scale enterprise, although this has occasionally led MIDAS into attempting to meet conflicting demands.  The salient issue here is that MIDAS cannot fulfill A.I.D.'s demand that it become a self-sustaining organization, and at the same time provide unprofitable support services to small-scale enterprises. Recommendations suggest ways to structure the cost accounting system so that the MIDAS could become commercially viable while providing these services on a full cost recovery basis through work order contracts.  Donors then would be able to target subsidies directly to desired support activities, instead of subsidizing the organization that provides the services.  It can be expected that this move will lead to more efficient allocation of resources within MIDAS and from donor organizations.

"Evaluates USAID/Senegal's Economic Support Fund (ESF) program to privatize Senegal's agricultural sector and help the Government of Senegal (GOS) make structural adjustments to its economy. Lessons learned evaluation covers FY 1983-85 and is based on interviews with design team members and GOS officials, and document review. The ESF program has undoubtedly brought timely, much needed reforms to Senegal and helped to prevent the GOS from falling into economic collapse.  The program has been a major factor in the GOS's reduction of its budget deficit by 50% and its balance of payments deficit by 45% since 1983.  ESF-engendered reforms in the agricultural sector are reducing farmer reliance on the GOS, its parastatals, and its pricing policies; encouraging greater use of private agricultural marketing channels; and helping to reduce the parastatal drain on the GOS budget. The program has also incidentally served to strengthen the economic capacity of USAID/S and to improve interdepartmental coordination within the Mission. Subsequent ESF programs in Senegal should perform economic, political, and cost-benefit analyses to judge the potential impact of ESF reforms and minimize disruptions caused by structural adjustments. The timing and implementation of the reforms so far have matched GOS ability and readiness to respond, but future steps should be timed to minimize their political and economic consequences.  It is also recommended that program design documents clearly define and quantify ""end of reform"" conditions (e.g., identify target ranges for improvements within a specified time frame); USAID/S design agricultural projects that mesh with and contribute to ESF reform goals; and the ESF program separate its goals from the IMF standby targets, in order to ensure the level of analysis needed to produce a sound, coherent program.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Economic support fund|Privatization|Agricultural policy|Policy reform|Agricultural development|National budgets|Economic reconstruction","Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW064.pdf","6,144 KB","","","008600 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish a rural health delivery network in Senegal.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 5/84-5/86 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel. The project has made good progress in the areas of training, health delivery, supervision, pharmaceutical supply, financial management, and establishment of a management information system (MIS).  For example, 316 health huts have been established in the target areas, and 8 health posts have been built; as a result, 89% of mothers regularly take chloroquine while pregnant or nursing to prevent malaria, and 55% of mothers utilized oral rehydration therapy the last time their children had diarrhea. Vaccination activities are behind schedule, however, and the planned nutrition program has not yet been implemented. The training component has trained literally thousands of community health workers (CHW's) and members of village health committees. Long-term training has been less successful:  only 4 of 10 officials scheduled for U.S. training have begun their studies, due partly to delays in signing a TA contract with Harvard University.  Short-term overseas training has been provided to 13 officials.  A project-established training center began operations in 1985, but needs to be used more.  Similarly, a twice a year refresher training program for the CHW's is in place but its performance has been subpar so far. Efforts to improve CHW supervision, the MIS, and the pharmaceutical distribution system have met with mixed success: all are designed well for the most part, but have operational difficulties that need to be addressed.  Finally, possibilities for self-financing of project activities when A.I.D. assistance ends are being explored at all levels. A total of 63 recommendations are made, focusing on accelerating malaria, ORT, and vaccination activities, expanding the use of the training center, improving supervision techniques, simplifying the MIS, improving the pharmaceutical supply system, and tightening financial management procedures.  In general, the project should concentrate on decentralizing management, improve communication between the administrative and local levels, complete construction of the health posts, and improve the upkeep and sanitation of the health huts.  It is also recommended that the project take steps to ensure the functional literacy of the CHW's in order to improve record keeping.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Medical education|Community health workers|Health facilities|Rural areas|Beneficiary count","Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW066.pdf","7,779 KB","","","008600 - USAID.

"Evaluates Food for Work (FFW) project implemented by CARE to build and maintain rural roads in Bangladesh.  Impact evaluation, follow-up to a 1983 impact evaluation, covers the period 1980-86 and is based on interviews with 683 farmers, businessmen, and others in villages near 17 roads built by the project in 1984 and in 18 comparison sites from the same upazillas visited in 1983. Also included were field inspections of 18 roads built in 1980. The roads built in 1980 and 1984 were in much better condition and more heavily travelled than roads proposed for reconstruction in 1987. Only 12% of the the latter were passable at least halfway by rickshaw, compared with 69% of the 1984 roads and 83% of the 1980 roads.  The superior condition of the older FFW roads is attributable to recent maintenance under the new Women's Maintenance Program (WMP). Evaluation data indicate that the project has improved local communications, reduced travel times and transport costs, and increased primary school attendance, commercial activity, local maintenance, access to health care, and use of new farm technologies.  There was some evidence that the project helped to increase agricultural production and farmgate prices and to lower input costs for most major crops.  On the other hand, there was no evidence of impact on crop mix, primary school absenteeism, road use by local women, or agricultural extension and family planning outreach.  Further, FFW roads actually seem to cause a decrease in the use of local health clinics, presumably because of increased access to upazilla hospitals. Roads with the highest development impacts tended to be those: (1) passable by rickshaw; (2) with fewer unbridged gaps; (3) recently maintained; (4) with good or excellent surface conditions; (5) near electricity lines or a bank; and (6) in areas with doash (mixed) soil rather than sandy soil.  Of these factors, the key indicator of overall impact for the 1984 roads was whether or not the road was fully passable by cycle rickshaw 2 years after construction.  These results are highly consistent with those of the 1983 evaluation, the main exceptions being the new indications of increased local maintenance and higher producer surpluses brought about by road reconstruction, and the failure to confirm positive impacts of the roads on the use of local health and family planning services and of fertilizer and better seeds. Despite the improvements in local maintenance, however, the evaluation team observed many roads with too few bridges and too little maintenance.  It recommends that USAID/B and CARE continue to support and expand the Appurtenant Structures Project and continue to encourage the expansion of the WMP and provide support if necessary.

"Final outside evaluation of a project to support satellite-based, university-level, distance education in Indonesia and the West Indies. Evaluation covers the period 1/82-12/85 and is based on document review, site visits, questionnaires, and interviews with participating officials and beneficiaries. Although Indonesia uses its satellite system mainly for undergraduate, and the West Indies for graduate and in-service education, their experiences are similar in many ways.  In general, the systems neither enhanced nor diminished student learning, but they did enable more students to be reached and students enjoyed hearing the viewpoints of students on other campuses.  Graduate students benefited the most (due to their lesser need for face-to-face contact), but the performance of undergraduates was greatly improved by the presence of a tutor in the receiving classroom.  The satellite technology was eagerly accepted, though teachers felt that it required more preparation but covered less material than normal instruction.  The systems' audio capabilities were heavily used; graphics transmission capability was rarely used, usually due to technical problems, but when working it seemed to enhance appreciation of the system. Provision of adequate logistical support (e.g., timely distribution of supplementary handouts) and adequate training of teachers and students in equipment use, along with utilization of appropriate interactive teaching techniques, were very important contributors to success. System use was low for administrative purposes and very low for exchange of research information.  However, the systems proved capable of stengthening user institutions, especially in the West Indies. No firm conclusions have been reached as to the affordability of either system by its member institutions.  The low use and reliability of the graphics equipment suggest that elimination or deferral of this component could reduce costs considerably. Project experiences show that a real need exists for this effective and affordable technology and point to the importance of:  a healthy host institution; a favorable geopolitical environment; realization that a great deal of time may be necessary before a system is ready; location of tele-classrooms near other educational facilities; selection of strong local leadership and continued good management; selection of user-friendly, reliable equipment; training of users both in equipment use to reduce the need for technicians and appropriate teaching techniques; and maintaining a tutor in the classroom.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","DPE-5811-C-00-1027-00","","1/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Educational delivery|Satellite communications|Communications technology|Universities and colleges|Educational extension programs","Indonesia|West Indies","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDWAA835.pdf","3,648 KB","006381 - Abt Associates, Inc.","","000182 - USAID.

"Evaluates project component (added by amendment in 7/83) to operationalize a computerized management information system (MIS) and subsystems within the Honduran Ministry of Education (MOE). Final external evaluation covers the period 7/83-4/86 and is based on document and system review, and interviews with Mission and MOE/MIS officials. Despite a 12-month project extension, results have been modest at best, due, inter alia, to poor planning, the project's failure to provide a MIS advisor as planned, and political instability within the MOE, leading to personnel turnover and a consequent lack of continous high-level commitment to the MIS.  Management tools and documents (e.g., programs, manuals, and procedures) for the MIS have yet to be formally developed at the requisite technical level; even the basic documentation of subsystems and applications is inadequate - a problem which will likely lead to maintenance problems in the future.  Although training was considered key, planned internships were never delivered, and the impact of other external training was limited by the high turnover levels.  Local training in word processing and in programming was provided, primarily to the data processing unit (DPU), but training of research and statistics units was inadequate. The planned Information Systems Department was not established per se, but a new designation, the ""Information System,"" was created as a budgeted activity with six staff positions.  In addition, the project did improve to a degree the efficiency, procedures, and user-friendliness of the pre-existing educational statistics subsystem. However, the collection of educational statistics remains paper-based for the most part, and as the data are never less than a year old when published (despite project-generated improvements in this area), they are of little or no use for policymaking or administrative decisionmaking. While a fair amount of systems development activity has taken place, some of the subsystems were not particularly well conceived, others suffered from political difficulties, and none interface directly with other subsystems.  The budget subsystem is used regularly, however. Despite the project's many problems, computerization is now firmly established within the MOE and there is a demand for new applications. A.I.D. should develop a follow-on project to capitalize on this situation and on the project's achievements, limited as they are.  Key needs are:  a plan for integrating existing and future subsystems; additional training of the research and analysis units; TA to MIS users as well as to data processing staff; new data management software to facilitate system development and integration; and additional hardware, including printers and terminals for MIS users.","Work order no. 80","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-4052-00","","4/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Management information systems|Information management|Computers|Computer software|Educational administration|System design|Technical training|Institution building","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW292.pdf","1,634 KB","000223 - Academy for Educational Development, Inc.

"Evaluates four Collaborative Research Support Programs (CRSP's), specifically Small Ruminants, Sorghum and Millet, Bean and Cowpea, and Soil Management.  External evaluation, conducted in 1986, is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with researchers and program officials. The CRSP's are effectively addressing LDC research needs, particularly those of small farmers, while at the same time increasing the technological options available to U.S. agriculture.  CRSP research, with few exceptions, has been excellent in both quality and quantity. In general, the CRSP's have focused on areas which are not addressed by International Agricultural Research Centers (IARC's) or by researchers in industrialized countries.  The mandated constraint that CRSP research be of benefit to both U.S. and LDC agriculture has, however, meant that certain areas of tropical agriculture cannot be studied.  Similarly, the requirement for LDC collaboration has limited some on-site testing (especially in sub-Saharan Africa), but linkages with LDC institutions have steadily improved over the life of the program.  Strong formal and informal linkages with IARC's have been forged as well, and relations among universities within a CRSP are excellent (although cross-CRSP ties and collaboration with A.I.D. Missions need to be improved). A major accomplishment of the program has been its substantial contribution to research capacity in LDC's through collaborative research, and through graduate training of more than 500 LDC scientists. All four CRSP's have developed effective management systems, although each operates differently.  Both overhead and capital costs compare favorably with those of IARC's and other research programs.  Review and selection of research projects, though not formal, is effective, although the External Evaluation Panels could make a greater contribution especially by emphasizing the relevance of research to LDC development.  Finally, despite calls to broaden the programs' mandates and activities (e.g., to include institution building and extension), the CRSP's should concentrate on the quality, focused research now being performed and not on expansion, especially in the face of probable continued declining budget allocations.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Research collaboration|Research centers|Universities and colleges|Land grant colleges|Host country cooperation","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAY239.pdf","3,174 KB","000051 - Board for International Food and Agricultural Development (BIFAD)","","","English","application/pdf","","","Hogan, Edward B.|Rachie, Kenneth O.|Robins, John S.","Agricultural research","[1986]","","","","Collaborative research support : program review study","","PN-AAY-239","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTk4NTI5","Technical Assistance","9311310|9311328|9311254|9311311"

"Evaluates project to establish a graduate management school in the Dominican Republic at the Universidad Catolica Madre y Maestra (UCMM) to offer academic degrees and executive training and conduct research. Midterm evaluation covers the period through 5/86 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with students, graduates, faculty, and administrators in the United States and the Dominican Republic. In general, the project is progressing well, attracting capable personnel and resolving problems as they occur.  A physical facility has been built and equipped; there is a functioning graduate Faculty of Administration; the Management Library is operating well; the Computer Center is in place; an Executive Training Institute (ETI) and a Center for Administrative and Economic Research (CAER) have been established; and participant training has been implemented.  Although it is too early for a complete impact analysis, a number of UCMM's M.B.A. and M.P.A. graduates report increases in salaries and job responsibility; faculty and in-service executives have also improved their knowledge and skills. In general, disbursement of project funds is somewhat behind schedule; the project's reporting system does not, however, make clear why this has occurred. Both the contractor (the University of South Carolina) and UCMM have generally performed well.  The project design remains valid, with a few exceptions, e.g., targets for enrollment.  However, certain modifications to the original design have already been made and others should be considered.  Staff responsible for needed adjustments are aware of problems, concerned about their timely resolution, and prepared to resolve them cooperatively. The major areas requiring midcourse attention are:  utilizing the collaborative assistance mode; increasing student enrollment and retention; planning for the remainder of the project; the optimal use of TA; improving reporting systems; strengthening and formalizing linkages with the public and private sectors; using the Computer Center to its potential; accomplishing research and consultancy projects under the direct sponsorship of the CAER; and strengthening the ETI.  Nevertheless, progress to date represents a solid foundation for a very complex effort. Several specific recommendations are made.","Attached to PD-AAW-555","Special Evaluation","Documents","517-0000-C-00-6039-00","","10/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Universities and colleges|Graduate education|Management education|Management research|Economics education|Economic research|Research centers|Institution building","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAW555A.pdf","2,692 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"Evaluates Phase II of a project to build rural water supply systems and to support system maintenance activities in the Yemen Arab Republic. Midterm evaluation covers the period 1985-9/86 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with Government of Yemen (YARG) and USAID/Y staff. The project's construction component has been an unqualified success. The contractor, New TransCentury Foundation (NTF), has overcome the combined constraints of logistics and terrain to produce 172 water supply systems that are well engineered and constructed to high-quality standards, and in the process has turned itself into a highly efficient turnkey construction unit. In addition, about 180 persons in 90 villages have been trained to operate and maintain the systems.  The systems have been widely accepted by villagers, who have been willing to pay for much of the capital and ancillary costs.  Also, the systems seem to be fostering a greater use of water (although water use and storage practices have not measurably changed) and have allowed women to use the time previously spent on water-fetching for agricultural work. Unfortunately, little progress has been made in meeting the primary objective of Phase II - to provide institutional development services to the Rural Water Systems Department (RWSD), the YARG implementing agency. here stems from RWSD's conception of itself as strictly a development agency and the ambiguous institutional objectives stated in the Memorandum of Understanding between USAID/Y and RWSD, not to mention the fact that RWSD did not become an autonomous agency as planned. It is therefore recommended that NTF concentrate on providing TA to RWSD and encourage RWSD to employ private firms to do the water system construction currently performed by NTF.  RWSD would perform the same functions it now performs (e.g., survey and design functions, tendering contracts for construction to private sector firms), only more efficiently. Specific recommendations are that:  (1) USAID/Y authorize no increase in the number of construction sites; (2) RWSD employees be phased back; and (3) NTF formulate detailed plans for providing TA to RWSD in planning, management, and supervising construction of water systems by private firms (in part through a functional Office of Planning and Management) and continue training village and RWSD technicians.  Also, USAID/Y must become more active in project monitoring, beginning with working with RWSD and NTF to develop a new Memorandum of Understanding. If significant progress towards implementing these recommendations is not made in 6-8 months after the Memorandum is formulated, the project should be terminated.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5942-C-00-4085-00","","9/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Water supply structures|Technical training|Institution building","Yemen","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW839.pdf","3,930 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"Evaluates project to improve water supplies and sanitation in the Ha'Apai Islands of Tonga by building household water storage tanks and water catchment systems.  Final external evaluation covers the period 6/81-8/86 and is based on site visits. Despite certain shortcomings in project design and implementation, fresh water supplies on Ha'Apai have been increased by approximately 1.5 million gallons (at a cost of about $0.25 per gallon), with concomitant improvements in health and sanitation.  In all, the project constructed and repaired 786 water tanks and one groundwater pumping system, directly benefiting some 5,600 people in 22 villages on 16 islands. The tanks have been plagued with maintenance problems, however. A drought following Cyclone Isaac in 1982 forced project management to speed up implementation, in part by using quickly erectable zincalume tanks, rather than ferrocement tanks as planned. These tanks, which were built by a crew from the Ministry of Works under the supervision of PCV's, soon developed leaks at the seams and in the bottom, due to shoddy workmanship and damage from pigs, which in some cases would use the tank site as a wallow.  In 1984, a large number of these tanks were found to be leaking.  As a result, construction of ferrocement tanks was begun in cooperation with the Niuola Women in Development Organization. However, of 477 ferrocement tanks built, 52% were found to be leaking in 1986, due again to shoddy workmanship - the tanks were built by villagers themselves, often without adequate supervision.  Also, although the level of community participation was high, homeowners too often lacked the training needed to keep the system operational, and critical maintenance (e.g., clearing gutters, keeping tanks covered) was not performed; as a result, the tanks either leaked, were not filled to capacity, or became contaminated with debris and mosquito larvae.  The project was extended to 8/86 to correct these problems, but the extension period fell 70% short of its target for tank repair, 30% short for guttering repair, and 100% short for water tap installation; a target to provide tank covers and mosquito screens was partially achieved. The project demonstrated that both community and household tanks have a place in the outer islands and that round ferrocement tanks are indubitably the best choice for rural household water storage.  Also, (1) project management should work closely with engineers to design a tank that is easy to build and will not leak; and (2) beneficiaries should be told what is expected of them in terms of upkeep before the tanks are built, and should receive maintenance training, and possibly a maintenance incentive (e.g., requiring a cash contribution from recipients toward the cost of the tank construction).","Evaluation period: 30 Jun 1981-31 Aug 1986","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","879-0251-G-SS-1005-00","","8/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Water supply engineering|Water storage|Water sanitation|Water supply structures|Water supply structure maintenance|Beneficiary count","Tonga","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW864.pdf","1,875 KB","001354 - Foundation for the Peoples of the South Pacific, Inc.","","005093 - USAID.

"Evaluates project implemented by the University of Rhode Island's (URI's) International Center for Marine Resource Development (ICMRD) to strengthen the fisheries sectors of developing countries through training, TA, and applied research. External mid-term evaluation covers the period 1982-86 and is based on document review and interviews with ICMRD and URI staff. URI/ICMRD has a unique combination of capabilities which make it responsive not only to the specific technical requirements of fisheries development, but also to the human factors involved. The facilities for information services, training, and applied research at URI are good. Project training and TA are organized into interdisciplinary activities tied to strong academic programs, and the addition of applied research has further enhanced the project.  ICMRD's capabilities in fisheries development are singular and should be preserved. Accordingly, recommendations are for A.I.D. to provide long-term support for ICMRD so that URI will be able to maintain its faculty and staff strength in areas related to the project.  The scope of ICMRD's activities should be broadened to include as many countries as possible, and A.I.D. and ICMRD should work together to encourage more Missions to utilize ICMRD in-country training and to encourage more LDC institutions to use ICMRD's research and information facilities.  Planning and coordination of technology transfer activities should be improved, and training manuals and other materials should be completed and made available in a wide variety of native languages.

"Evaluates OPG to Africare to introduce a village-based honey and beeswax production, processing, and marketing program in Zambia's western and central provinces.  Final evaluation covers the period 10/83-8/86 and is based on visits to Zambia by U.S. specialists in apiculture and economics. The apiculture specialist found that the project, while 12-18 months behind schedule due to delays in assigning a resident manager to Kaoma and in constructing a honey processing plant and personnel housing there, is basically well-managed and has excellent potential for further success.  The project has made great strides since Kaoma received a permanent manager in 5/85. A total of 356 new beekeepers have been recruited and the number should exceed 500 by the end of 1986. Extension work has included hands-on training of village beekeepers in bark hive construction, honey collection and grading, and beeswax processing and 1-week courses at a Farmer Training Center (completed to date by 41 beekeepers).  The honey and wax being sold are of good quality, the beekeepers are enthusiastic, and the project seems to fill a real need.  On the basis of these successes, a 2-year extension is recommended.  On a negative note, however, project sustainability is threatened by the fact that only 5 of the 30 persons in the Department of Forestry's Beekeeping Division have been suitably trained in beekeeping, and none of these are stationed in the project area.  Also, the Kaoma manager, while very capable, also lacks significant formal training in either management or apiculture. Regarding economic aspects, after relatively poor showings in 1984 and 1985 - due in part to climatic conditions, inadequate logistic support, and scarcity of materials - performance picked up in 1986 and the potential for increased honey production from established beekeepers seems good.  Overall, production will approach 42% of the projected level for the 1984-86 period, leading to increases for small farmers of nearly 85% in incremental per capita income and nearly 25% in nominal per capita income over the 1982 level.  Market factors have not generally constrained output as much as delays in constructing the processing plant have.  Local authorities have applied floor prices for honey and beeswax in an attempt to strike a balance between producer and consumer needs.  Finally, although Africare evidently views the shortage of technical and managerial skills on the part of project staff as a situation that will gradually improve, training for the project manager and the accountant are critical to the project's success, as is Africare's own continued association with the Beekeeping Division. Also, no attempt has been made to repay the Africare loan for establishment of a revolving fund.","Attached to PD-AAW-990","Special Evaluation","Documents","611-G-3019","","9/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Apiculture|Agricultural extension","Zambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAW990A.pdf","1,447 KB","000235 - Africare, Inc.","","008627 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to found and develop the Investment Council of Panama (ICP) to promote foreign investment in Panama.  External mid-term evaluation covers the period 1983-85 and is based on document review and interviews with Government of Panama (GOP), USAID/P, ICP, and business representatives and ICP clients. ICP's performance has been unsatisfactory and is far from meeting the project purpose and targets.  Reasons for this lack of success relate to a combination of factors, both internal (e.g., poor management, lack of market research) and external (e.g., the Panamanian political situation). ICP has failed to adhere to project design and to comply with TA and training plans, and has shown a tendency to view the Project Agreement as illustrative rather than definitive.  ICP is currently in a state of institutional disarray, having failed to establish a viable organizational structure and a stable, professional management team. For example, although GOP contributions increasingly fell short of those planned, the fact that even A.I.D. funds remained largely unspent points to management problems. The original project design was faulty in many of its assumptions crucial to project success.  For its part, USAID/P failed to insist on compliance with plans from the start and was lax in its monitoring functions in that it failed to insist on remedies when it identified problems. Contrary to the larger achievements it has claimed, ICP's impact on investment in Panama has been minimal.  A survey shows that it has attracted only four companies, representing investment of $1.6 million and creation of 160 jobs, though other firms already in Panama were also helped.  Neither ICP's Research and Development Office (RDO) nor its Investment Promotion Office (IPO) has organized itself to carry out its tasks, and those activities which they have carried out were ill-conceived and have had very limited success.  However, the Investor Services Office (ISO), though not conforming exactly to plans, is providing information and servicing investors diligently and effectively, despite being hampered by its reliance on the other departments' products and services.  Investors rated the ISO services as good to excellent. It is recommended that the project be placed under ""review"" for one year, during which time ICP can be reorganized, strategic studies can be completed, and negotiations can proceed with the GOP.  The reasons for choosing this option are that the original idea remains valid (an official investment promotion agency is necessary), and despite ICP's many shortcomings, many of the elements needed for success already exist within the ICP structure.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0001-I-00-3171-00","","4/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Foreign investment|Investment promotion|Parastatals|Institution building","Panama","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX308.pdf","7,782 KB","007433 - Price Waterhouse","","008589 - USAID.

"Project Assistance Completion Report on a project (6/79-6/86) to improve the planning capabilities of the Jamaican Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). The project's principal contribution was the development of an extensive training program for the MOA.  Short-term training was provided overseas and in-country in agricultural policy formulation and analysis and data collection procedures.  A Learning Resource Center was established to prepare educational materials in systems analysis, computer programming, data collection and management, and evaluation methodologies. Installation of a mainframe computer for the MOA's Data Bank and Evaluation Unit was another major project contribution.  One of the many uses to which the computer was put was analysis of data from a food survey consumption survey, which benefited USAIS/J's food aid planning as well as the MOA.  The computer, however, functions at only a fraction of its potential capacity, due in large part to inadequate levels of skilled personnel and support. The project also prepared a series of policy planning and analytical reports, covering a wide range of activities; these reports provided background for a Five-Year Plan.  The Plan, however, while a good historical review, did not thoroughly analyze the constraints facing the agricultural sector. Finally, the project financed installation of a Comprehensive Resource Inventory and Evaluation System (CRIES) comprising land use, soil, and crops databases.  The land use database was updated over the period 1983-85, but unfortunately the MOA did not achieve full benefit from the system due to inadequate access to suitable satellite imagery. The TA contractor for the non-CRIES activities did enhance the MOA's data collection abilities, but was less successful in institutionalizing policy analysis skills.  In general, this was because the TA team members, lacking previous development project experience, tended to function as MOA staff and failed to recognize that surveys, computers, etc., are ultimately only tools to be used in support of policy formulation.  On the Jamaican side, the project suffered from extensive staff turnover, especially for more skilled personnel who could not be retained on their MOA salaries. Overall, this project, rather than preparing a long-term blueprint for sector development with detailed quantitative targets, should have devoted its limited resources to programming public investment and improving the system of prices, incentives, and performances of markets. Future activities to strengthen public agencies' planning capacities should keep in mind that these agencies need to be able to respond quickly to changing events.  This requires a much improved information base and some centralized responsibility for policy coordination.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural policy|Policy analysis|Policy making|Agricultural planning|Technical training|Government departments|Institution building","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX529.pdf","176 KB","008563 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to support the West African Remote Sensing Center (CRTO), a regional remote sensing training facility in Ouagadougou. Final external evaluation covers 1978-86 and is based on visits to 12 of the 15 CRTO member countries and interviews with involved personnel. The project's main contribution has been in training Africans in remote sensing technology and its applications.  In all, 221 Africans have received training, 75% in French.  Training is arranged in two 3-month courses, an introductory course and an advanced, applications-oriented course.  About half of those who complete the introductory course continue to the next level. Most trainees return to the government agencies that sent them, and about 25% are believed to be actively utilizing the training. A common criticism is that the training is too short and not specialized enough. The user assistance program, a major objective of the project, has been plagued by limited staff and financial resources, limited availability of remote imagery, lack of TA since 1982 due to contractual problems, and the inevitable problems faced when a regional institution is asked to work on country-specific problems.  Most activities have, as a result, been limited to Burkina Faso.  CRTO's library/archives need reorganizing and refurbishing; its photo lab, while basically well-housed and equipped, has suffered from managerial and maintenance problems, and more serious, delays in recruiting an African manager. The Center has helped expand the understanding of remote sensing in the region, although information dissemination exclusive of the training program has been slight.  The Africanization of CRTO staff has proceeded well, but the Africanization of its finances is more difficult to measure; the probability is that contributions from participating nations will decline, while operating expenses will increase.  CRTO's management tends to be hierarchical and compartmentalized, which has negative effects on staff morale. Despite high-quality TA, the project has been adversely affected by (1) contract problems during a period (1982-84) of A.I.D. indecision as to the project's future and (2) ambiguity as to who at A.I.D. (Mission or Bureau) is charge of field implementation; (3) its fairly low priority within A.I.D. The project teaches that:  (1) the effectiveness of TA depends as much on continuity and management as on technical quality; (2) regional programs may be a good way to introduce new technologies but not to apply them; (3) technology-driven projects run the risk of confusing means with ends; (4) remote sensing does not require high technology equipment and training to be an effective tool in resource evaluation and development.  Recommendations are for A.I.D. to continue to support remote sensing, but to not participate in the Phase II being planned by other donors.","Work order no. 6|French ed.: PD-AAZ-356, Revised ed.: PD-AAZ-357|Annexes: PD-ABD-294","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0000-I-00-4105-00","","9/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Remote sensing|Training centers|Technical training|Indigenization","Africa south of Sahara|Sahel|Burkina Faso","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX623.pdf","1,577 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Project assistance completion report on a project (7/83-9/87) to improve the level of eye care in selected Caribbean countries by training physicians and nurses in intermediate-level eye care. The project achieved some of its objectives; yet, some targets were not reached and others will require more time to assess.  A regional training program was set up through the University of the West Indies which should, since it is designed and taught by West Indian personnel, be relevant to eye care problems prevalent in the region.  This program has trained three project-funded and five externally funded physicians. Nurses' training by the International Eye Foundation (IEF) and a project-trained physician has already resulted in the introduction of glaucoma screening programs and public education campaigns on preventable eye disease and injuries.  A standardized nurses' training curriculum has been set and teaching materials have been distributed to all of the project countries for use by trained nurse educators. An indisputable success of the project has been its ability to leverage and coordinate greater donor assistance to maximize impact.  In fact, the project hosted the first Caribbean Eye Care Seminar for the Prevention of Blindness in Barbados in 12/83.  A similar meeting, with participation by A.I.D., has been held annually since, culminating in 1986 in the formal establishment of an Inter-Agency Committee for Eye Care in the Caribbean. The overall impact of the physicians' training program, however, receives a mixed score.  Of the three project-supported trainees, one has not been accepted by his peers (because the training was diploma, not degree, level), one left government service prior to completing her in-country practicum, and one transferred out of the program.  Of the five physicians supported by external funding, four have used the program as the first step towards advanced training in ophthalmology. Thus, while six of the physicians completed the course and passed the University of London DO exams (which generally have a pass rate of 20% or less), only one of these six was supported by project funds. This indicates that the quality of the program was not at fault and points to three interrelated problems:  the candidate selection process; the delays and uncertainties surrounding the certification process; and the intention of the program, i.e., to train only to the diploma level while discouraging advanced training toward an internationally recognized ophthalmology degree (and possible emigration). Lessons learned include:  (1) project expectations, and the roles of participating agencies, must be clearly understood and agreed to from the start; (2) training programs must be assessed with regard to the acceptance of the training by local organizations.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Eye care|Eye diseases|Health professional education|Ophthalmology|Physician education|Nursing education","Eastern Caribbean|Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX718.pdf","490 KB","001757 - USAID.

"This evaluation of the Foundation for the Peoples of the South Pacific (FSP) is one in a series of institutional evaluations aimed at documenting effective PVO approaches to institution building.  The evaluation is based on field visits and interviews in Fiji, the Solomon Islands, and the Kingdom of Tonga. The FSP is the most respected private voluntary organization active in the South Pacific nations.  After almost a quarter century of exclusive commitment to the region, it has built up: an unrivaled network of organizations and individuals; an important resevoir of trust among peoples who have too often had their trust betrayed by outside entities; and a broad experience in the successful management of a range of development projects throughout this diverse region. FSP is strongly committed to institutional development in the South Pacific and toward this end has created a number of autonomous trusts throughout the region.  These trusts are locally incorporated PVO's dedicated to carrying out local programs to help their people.  FSP helps with the initial organizational stages and provides an advisor/trainer to work with the new group for a few years.  Some of these trusts have been spectacularly successful in developing their programs and in attracting financial support.  In particular, the Solomon Islands Development Trust and the South Pacific Appropriate Technology Foundation now operate major programs totally without support from FSP. FSP has also helped to expand the involvement of women in development activities throughout the region.  Both in Tonga and in the Solomon Islands, its women's interest programs have been influential, although these programs operate quite differently in the Polynesian and Melanesian cultural contexts. FSP also supports the development of microenterprises through its support of commercial fishing groups in Tonga and the Solomons. In the latter especially, FSP is strongly committed to carrying out its program through local private entrepreneurial groups to the extent possible. FSP is facing a budgetary crisis due to U.S. aid cuts; its annual budget dropped over 75% between FY86 and FY87.  As a result, FSP, its country programs, and affiliated trusts are reorganizing to survive in a very different funding environment from the one that has prevailed during the past 6 years.  With the support of A.I.D.'s South Pacific Regional Development Office, FSP has streamlined its operations so that it now operates most of its programs from a regional office in Fiji. Its two remaining country programs, Solomon Islands and Tonga, are pulling together support from other sources (European NGO's, national governments, other U.S. sources).  The evaluation makes one recommendation: that A.I.D. provide bridging support to FSP for the next 3 years.

"Final evaluation of a subproject (SP), implemented by CATIE (Tropical Agriculture Research and Training Center) to research fuelwood species and cultivation practices in Central America, and preliminary assessment of the follow-on Tree Crop Production (TCP) project (5960117). Evaluation covers the period through 12/85. CATIE has been firmly established as a regional center for information on and seeds for fast-growing tree species, particularly those of importance for fuelwood. The SP has met or exceeded most of its quantifiable objectives in such areas as studies, on-farm trials, demonstrations, training, and technical publications. It has also established a good management structure and exceptional leadership. Finally, and most importantly, it has managed to involve high-quality staff at every level, including well-trained country coordinators. On the other hand, objectives not achieved include: (1) a fully functioning database on all phases of fuelwood production, including ecological, agronomic, social acceptance, and economic considerations; (2) first-year baseline and final-year assessments of national and CATIE capacities in fuelwood research and demonstration; and (3) incorporation into CATIE core staff of at least one of the project's international specialists. On a larger scale, there are few indications that the notion of self-sustaining fuelwood research activities is viable. CATIE, even more than national agencies, remains almost completely dependent on project funds for its personnel, material, and other inputs. The only indications of sustainability are at the national level where local agencies have put a large number of staff to work on project activities but adequate funding is also a constraint at this level. Overall, the transition from the SP to the TCP has been extremely smooth and many of the shortcomings of the first are being or can be addressed in the latter, although the exact purpose of the TCP needs to more sharply focused. Because CATIE-based SP staff were unable to spend sufficient time in the field, the TCP project coordinator should immediately review staff job descriptions. Also, socioeconomic research should be broadened to focus on four areas: production and investment analyses; incentive mechanisms; a socioeconomic database; and traditional rural wood industry opportunities. Work on the fuelwood database, field demonstrations, and training of national staff should continue, and more emphasis should be placed on extension of existing and new technical packages to agents and farmers. Finally, the project should better document its activities and coordinate them with the ROCAP regional forestry advisor.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABI-169","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PDC-0000-I-00-4104-00","","7/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Agroforestry|Agricultural research|Firewood|Varietal research|Research centers|Institution building|International level|National level|Agricultural extension","Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX987.pdf","3,988 KB","001600 - Associates in Rural Development, Inc.

"Evaluates self-help projects carried out in Madagascar using counterpart funds generated from P.L. 480 Title I and Title II programs. The P.L. 480 Title I and Title II programs have been successful, working for the mutual benefit of Madagascar and the United States. These programs aid rural development and promote a policy of spreading goodwill toward the United States among the people.  Since 1981 the United States has donated $62 million worth of food to Madagascar. After deducting transportation and marketing costs as well as the gift component, the sale of this food has generated $40 million in Malagasy francs.  These counterpart funds will be used for rural development, and $16 million has already been spent on 248 projects. The projects are proposed at a local level, evaluated and selected by the Malagasy Government, and then approved by USAID/M The program has focused on rehabilitation, but also includes construction.  The most successful of the projects have contributed to the agricultural productivity of the Malagasy cultivators, helping them to satisfy their basic food needs. Irrigation systems, clean water delivery systems to promote health, and feeder roads to improve agricultural transport are examples of the type of projects which aid this goal. Small projects, particularly in irrigation or health, provide the best examples of the value of American aid.  A small irrigation system makes a large impact on the lives that it touches.  During the field visits to these projects, the evaluators found the cultivators friendly and excited to meet the people who indirectly helped them improve their lives.  More importantly, the peasants had usually contributed materials, labor, and sometimes financing to the projects.  Thus, P.L. 480 counterpart funds have helped them to achieve their own visions:  to build a bridge to reduce their isolation from the outside world, to cultivate the entire valley with rice, or to provide clean water for their children. Improvements could be made in the program.  Host government procedures could be streamlined to facilitate disbursal of funds. Participation from the local inhabitants could be increased, to increase their stake in the projects and ensure their continued interest in maintenance.  Small projects which target crops other than rice could also be expanded.

"PACR of a project to strengthen integrated regional health services in 449 depressed barangays on Panay Island, the Philippines. The project achieved (or exceeded) about 97% of its specific targets. The incidence of tuberculosis and gastrointestinal infections was reduced by 65% and 82%, respectively, vs. targets of 25%.  Second-degree malnutrition decreased 96%, exceeding a target of 70%, while the crude birth rate was reduced to 21 (per 1,000 married women 15-49 years), surpassing a planned rate of 24.  On the negative side, third-degree malnutrition decreased by only 14% (vs. a targeted of 40%), and there was an apparant rise in infant mortality of 10-15% (although this figure is possibly inaccurate). Several lessons were learned.  (1) Clear identification of project outputs, intermediate and impact targets, and the quantification and operational definition of these targets made project monitoring more effective by providing project management with necessary direction in project implementation.  (2) Supportive involvement of regional and provincial leaders also contributed to project success, and has led to the continued operation of the project even after A.I.D. funding ceased. (3) The project made a strong case for the use of community health workers.  The CHW's role increased over time as communities came to appreciate and benefit from their services.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated health care|Community health workers|Community health care","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDCAZ677.pdf","63 KB","008592 - USAID.

"This review evaluates the preformance and progress of the Title III program in Bangladesh during FY 1986. The price policy conditions were effective in stimulating a ""productive policy dialogue,"" and, the evaluation team believes, resulted in government commitments to reduce the subsidy element in marketing operations where income of beneficiaries does not warrant subsidization of food.  The government has not been able to maintain the benchmark stock levels set forth, and was thus not able to benefit from special currency use offset provisions. The team noted that ""while the programmed level of P.L. 480 wheat and rice may not in and of themselves constitute a significant disincentive to policy and price reforms, the total grant and concessional food aid provided from all sources could represent such a disincentive.""  The government has been more successful in leveling out fluctuations in farm prices through its acquisition program.  The team cautions that the government should be gradually increasing domestic purchases in order to become less dependent on imports and food aid, and that they must introduce greater location-and market-specific flexibility into pricing decisions.

"An evaluation of the P.L. 480 Title III program in Haiti from 1985-86, this review discusses in depth the institutional and political constraints that affected the level of success in implementing the self help measures (SHM's) and policy reforms attached to the Title III Agreement.  Most of the conclusions are in the area of program design and management. The only two SHMs' directly affecting the agricultural sector that were successfully completed were (1) coffee tax reduced, and (2) wheat flour price reduced.  In the area of general marketing systems reforms, the transportation sector, which affects agricultural traders, was affected by (1) the increase of diesel fuel taxes, (2) revised procedures for petroleum import taxes, and (3) increased use of labor-intensive methods for road construction. The review concludes that government officials, not surprisingly, will not hesitate to agree to a set of reforms in order to secure financing for food imports in politically unstable times, even though they are not strongly committed to the reforms - and that, once committed to a set of reforms on paper, the government only implemented those which it perceived to have direct immediate benefit, i.e., revenue producing measures, and politically positive changes affecting prime constituencies.  Another main conclusion of the review was that ""real reforms will not take place if they are not placed within a viable institutional framework,"" and that the lack of an institutional framework and positive attitude in Haiti was the primary barrier to effective development change leveraged through Title III.

"A study of all aspects of the Title I program in Liberia, this evaluation includes a section on program issues and impacts as well as discussions of the general economic situation and P.L. 480 management/logistical issues. Macroeconomic Impacts:  The $20 million in sales proceeds from Title I commodity sales were programmed to finance over 90% of the government's development budget in 1986, a proportion which has been consistent since 1984, reflecting the extreme economic distress in Liberia.  The direct balance-of-payments (BOP) effect from 1980-86 was measured as a savings of $76 million, and the estimated BOP savings from 1987-92 are an additional $66 million. Impacts on gross domestic product depend on the uses of the sales proceeds and the subsequent ripples through the Liberian economy - an econometric simulation model based on a Keynesian aggregate demand framework estimates that the cumulative contribution of P.L. 480 to GDP, based on the econometrically derived multiplier plus estimated increased P.L. 480 levels, would be $118.28 million between 1987-92. Food Sector Impacts:  The P.L. 480 program has been managed to support government policy in providing incentive prices to domestic producers of rice; the study finds that if P.L. 480 rice were sold at imported rice costs rather than at the administered price, virtually no domestic rice would be marketed in Monrovia. P.L. 480 rice also contributes to price stabilization goals through a strategy of supply management, allowing the GOL to maintain rice stocks.  Substantial price stabilization has been achieved by the government through this policy, though at costs higher than expected.  Deficiencies in storage capabilities and in timing of imports have resulted in high costs and waste. Management:  The parastatal organization charged with management of P.L. 480 rice (LPMC) has encountered management and financial problems including losses through uncollectible accounts receivable and unpaid transfers to other ministries.  The LPMC is in arrears with regards to the debt from these losses.

"PACR of a project (7/80-10-85) to improve Moroccan institutional capabilities to provide vocational and skills training to low- income youth. Overall, the project was successful in developing institutions capable of providing training services which could increase the employability of the target population.  Control of these institutions has been entirely taken over by qualified Moroccan teachers, instructors, and administrative staff, many of whom were trained under the project.  Most importantly, the Ministry of Handicrafts and Social Affairs (MAAS) is continuing activities initiated under the project with its own resources. Under the project-established National Institute of Social Action's (INAS) 2-year social worker training program, 143 participants have graduated, and 47 more are currently in the first year of the program; 45% of all trainees are women.  Most graduates have been hired by MAAS/Entraide Nationale (EN); however, most are performing accounting and recordkeeping rather than professional tasks, and placement of future graduates at MAAS/EN is very unlikely.  Eighteen short-term training sessions were held at INAS, which were attended by 1,133 MAAS entry- and mid-level staff (854 women and 279 men), vs. a target of 1,100. No study of the impact of this training was made, however, and some participants felt that the sessions were too short (2 weeks) to be of much academic or practical value. Five pilot skill centers (CET's) were opened to train disadvantaged young women in non-traditional vocational skills. A total of 329 women have completed 2-year training programs in carpentry, welding, food preparation, kindergarten administration, leatherwork, and typewriter repair, and another 89 have finished their first year of training; the total number of women trained represents 100% of the project target. All the centers had problems, however, in the areas of job placement, curriculum development, diploma equivalency certification, placement follow-up, and funding for raw materials and spare parts. A total of 13 Vocational Educational Centers (CFP's) were established to train poor young primary school dropouts, mostly males.  Two teams of Peace Corps volunteers (PCV's) set up and staffed 40 workshops in programs such as electricity, welding, auto mechanics, and carpentry; official data on graduates were unavailable, but projections indicate that about 1,340 completed 2-year programs, and 480 completed one year of training. However, enrollments have fallen steadily, due mostly to inadequate facilities and a poor record on job placement.  The Moroccan instructors who replaced the PCV's in 1983 appear to be competent and committed, but there are no documented, standardized curricula for them to follow. Five of the eight planned academic training (U.S. and third country) participants have completed M.S. degrees and have returned to employment in Morocco; two have extended their studies, and one has been dropped. Major deficiencies included:  (1) a lack of detailed curricula in all training centers; (2) unresolved diploma equivalency issues between CET's, CFP's, and other vocational educational institutions; (3) a lack of evaluation capabilities to analyze the impacts of training on beneficiaries; and (4) poor progress made by MAAS/INAS in revising curricula and developing a job placement system for graduates.  A final problem was overcentralization of decisionmaking at MAAS, leaving Entraide Nationale, the institution charged with actually implementing the program, out of all planning stages and much of the later direction of the program.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","10/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","","Vocational training|Institution building|Training centers|Government departments|Participants|Youth|Women|Social workers|Employment|Beneficiary count","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDCAT719.pdf","2,514 KB","008579 - USAID.
