"Since 2004, the United States Agency for International Development's (USAID) Office of Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM) in Washington has held an annual Reconciliation Program Fund small-grants competition through an ""Annual Program Statement"" (APS).&nbsp; The APS is funded through a Congressional appropriation mandate that grants utilize a people-to-people (P2P) reconciliation approach to guide their work.&nbsp; According to CMM's ""People-to-People Peacebuilding: A Program Guide,""&nbsp; the underlying Theory of Change (ToC) is that in ""communities where elites or other societal forces have damaged or severed the relationships connecting individuals and groups of differing ethnic, political, religious, or other identities&hellip;[building or rebuilding] strong, positive relationships will mitigate against the forces of dehumanization, stereotyping, and distancing that facilitate violence.""&nbsp; Thus, by creating a safe space where representatives from conflicting groups can interact, prejudices and perceived differences of ""others"" can be confronted, challenged, and hopefully ultimately replaced by ""mutual understanding, trust, empathy, and resilient social ties.""&nbsp; In the fall of 2011, CMM awarded Social Impact (SI) a contract to conduct a two-year evaluative learning review of targeted awards and activities under the CMM People-to-People Reconciliation APS through a pilot application of this developmental evaluation&nbsp; methodology.&nbsp; The objectives of this review were not only to learn about the reconciliation APS projects themselves, but also to build CMM's technical leadership in evaluation of complex programs.&nbsp; The evaluation team's work was divided into three phases, which were not necessarily implemented in succession, but rather with learning and action reflection steps integrated throughout: Phase I, knowledge management and study of the reconciliation APS; Phase II, field evaluation of selected APS programs; Phase III, reflective learning.&nbsp; This final report is a synthesis of not only the five key products, but also the findings from the process of undertaking an evaluation inspired by a developmental evaluation framework and the lessons this can provide not only CMM for future APS work, but peacebuilding programming and evaluation more broadly.&nbsp; After the introduction key findings from each of the five products are presented as a summary. The report is then divided into individual chapters with the full desk review, meta-evaluation and analysis, and three field evaluation reports presented individually.&nbsp; The final two chapters review and synthesize findings on: (1) the APS' efforts to support conflict mitigation and reconciliation activities around the world, consider these in light of the guidance on P2P reconciliation, and offer scenarios of potential future developments in the APS; and (2) evaluation of the APS to date, and offer values, principles, and scenarios for potential development of evaluation within CMM, USAID, or similar complex settings.&nbsp; In addition, the evaluation team's reflections on the team's process of adapting a developmental approach to evaluating this type of programming are offered in the final chapter.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Contents: Acknowledgements -- Acronyms -- Preface --Chapter 1.

"This is an evaluation of the performance and lessons from the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health's (PATH) implementation of the TB TO 2015 Program since 2009. &nbsp;The main objectives were to determine if USAID-supported interventions increased TB case notification and successful treatment in the targeted areas. &nbsp;The purpose was to evaluate project performance with special attention to advocacy, communication, and social mobilization (ACSM) activities and to formulate recommendations to USAID for future TB projects. &nbsp;The report is based on: (1) review of planning documents and reports from USAID, PATH, national programs, and other sources; (2) interviews with staff and partners; and (3) observations from site visits in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. &nbsp;The main questions the evaluation was to answer were: (1) whether TB TO 2015 is on track to meet the expected results; (2) the extent to which the project was effective in achieving objectives; (3) factors for success and shortcomings; and (4) which priorities and steps USAID should consider in future projects to support TB control. &nbsp;The evaluation found that, in general, implementation of the project was considered on track, though there were varying delays in some countries. &nbsp;Weaknesses mentioned in interviews were: (1) insufficient interaction of USAID with national programs before preparing the plan of action to harmonize USAID project priorities with the National Tuberculosis Program (NTP) perceived needs; (2) short-term financing that interfered with recruitment; and (3) insufficient communication with consortium partners about progress in country support. &nbsp;USAID and PATH staff interviewed both expressed concern about delays in launching activities, mostly because multiple layers of approval were required from national and international agencies. &nbsp;Field observation in Tanzania showed the excellent collaboration with national staff at all levels and with community organizations, and the consistency of laboratory and patient records with data in the reports. &nbsp;In conclusion, the TB TO 2015 Project seems to be on track to achieve its operational objectives in terms of all the key components listed, and it also seems to be a very good investment of USAID support that will have lasting impact on TB control globally as well as in some of the countries involved. &nbsp;It is too early to assess the epidemiologic objective of reducing TB prevalence and burden of disease; and the strategies used as models (the Stop TB Strategy and MDR-TB Global Response Plan 2007&ndash;08) do not prioritize interruption of transmission (screening suspects with microscopy, IPC, control of contacts) or prevention of MDR-TB, concentrating instead on patient management. &nbsp;ACSM has been successfully used to support TA and to build national capacity. &nbsp;Technical assistance quality was good, and coordination with and support to the NTPs were in general excellent. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","'Evaluation of the Activities, Operational Results, and Impact of USAID Support to TB Control through Task Order 2015 from 2009 to 2013 and Lessons Learned'|Project title: Global health technical assistance project bridge IV (GH Tech IV)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-OAA-C-13-00113","","11/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","Tuberculosis|Disease treatment|Disease prevention and control|Community mobilization|Advocacy|Communication channels|Multidrug-resistant/extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/XDR-TB)|Health care systems|Human capacity development","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JR8J.pdf","609 KB","011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

"Stability in Key Areas (SIKA) West aims to expand and improve the legitimacy of the Afghan Government to districts and unstable communities.&nbsp; This project's strategy is to assist district entities to better understand their operating environment and the challenges to stability they face.&nbsp; SIKA West enables district governments to develop a localized methodology and to implement activities aimed at addressing local sources of instability.&nbsp; The findings of this evaluation suggest that SIKA West is not a stabilization program, but a local governance program with a stabilization component.&nbsp; The focus on programming is on improving local governance, service delivery, and linkages of communities to district and provincial entities.&nbsp; While this is done through a District Stability Committee (DSC) process that has shown success at strengthening community cohesion, the programming does not appear to match&nbsp;the Independent Directorate for Local Governance&nbsp;(IDLG) nor the Ministry for Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD) expectations for alignment and sustainability on communication and capacity building (required for improved local governance).&nbsp; The inherent issue with SIKA West's programming is its lack of a properly articulated theory of change which would explain to management and stakeholders what the results of implemented activities should be.&nbsp; This lack of a defined theory of change results in sub-optimal implementation and assessment of the four Intermediate Results (IRs) - and without outcomes measurement in its Performance Management Plan (PMP), SIKA West performance measurement is likely to result in fewer lessons-learned (both positive and negative) that can tie directly back to improving the performance of implemented activities.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","'Measuring Impact of Stabilization Initiatives (MISTI) Project'|Submitted as: Stabilization in key area - SIKA west mid-term performance evaluation","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-306-TO-12-00004|AID-OAA-I-10-00002","","3/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","Stability|Conflict resolution|Political reconciliation|Governance|Community development|Public participation|Women's rights|Women's political leadership|Rural areas|Districts","Afghanistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JRB4.pdf","578 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"The Uganda Capacity Program (UCP) supports the operationalization of the Human Resources for Health Policy and Strategic Plan and other HRH interventions that need to be rolled out and scaled up to achieve the goals and objectives of the Health Sector Strategic Plan III (2010/11).&nbsp; UCP aims to strengthen human resources for the delivery of health and HIV/AIDS services.&nbsp; It contributes to Uganda&rsquo;s Country Development Strategy Development Objective (DO) 3:&nbsp; ""Improved health and nutritional status in focus areas and population groups,"" as well as several Intermediate Results (IRs) and sub-IRs that constitute DO 3.&nbsp; The evaluation team conducted an evidence-based performance evaluation of the UCP to independently establish the effectiveness of the interventions of the program.&nbsp; The evaluation relied on a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods, including a UCP and country-specific document review, key informant interviews with relevant stakeholders, focus group discussions, and direct observations.&nbsp; Four specific questions guided the UCP performance evaluation: (1) How effective has the project been in achieving its Intermediate Result 1:""Increased Capacity for HRH Policy and Planning"" by the third year and are the outcomes expected by September 2014 still valid and achievable, or do they need to be adjusted to reflect realities of the current context; (2) does performance in the last three years demonstrate an appropriate technical and strategic approach by UCP to performance management and performance improvement in the current context [and] what interventions are yielding, or have the potential to yield, the greatest impact and what interventions are not, and are there any additional interventions that could be more effective; (3) how well has UCP strengthened country ownership and sustainability of their HRH - related interventions, and are there any additional interventions/activities that could enhance country ownership and sustainability; and (4) how well has UCP strengthened and supported the private not for profit (PNFP) sector, and how well has UCP supported the work of USAID implementing partners?&nbsp; The evaluation concluded overall that the UCP is an ambitious venture that effectively increased national and district HRH policy and planning capacity, galvanized a wide range of stakeholders from the public and private sectors and the donor community to collaborate in rolling out new HRH systems and policies nationally.&nbsp; Together, UCP and the Uganda Ministry of Health (MOH) mounted an outstanding advocacy and lobbying effort to address a well-documented shortage of health workers in the country, resulting in allocation of substantial funding to recruit and deploy more than 7,000 health workers across the country, and contributing considerably to reducing national health worker shortages.&nbsp; Evaluators agree with MOH officials, that while the program made great strides, the capacity at central and district levels to manage, coordinate, and sustain HRH policy and planning is still not optimal, due in part to structural and motivational issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;Performance management fits well within the UCP's HRH strategic focus and was an identified priority by stakeholders.&nbsp; Overall, GOU is now in a better position to lead, prioritize HRH issues, but independent implementation, performance and accountability with regards to key interventions are still variable.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Cover title: Performance evaluation of Uganda capacity program|Evaluated project title: Uganda capacity program (UCP)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-617-TO-13-00001|RAN-I-00-09-00016-00|AID-RAN-I-00-09-00016","","1/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","Health policy|Human capacity development|Health facilities|Disease transmission|HIV/AIDS|Health workers|Health education","Uganda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JRCP.pdf","1,310 KB","001891 - International Business and Technical Consultants, Inc.

"<p>The USAID-funded Sudan Transition and Conflict Mitigation (STCM) program aimed to establish and manage a quick-response mechanism that would strengthen Sudanese confidence and capacity to address the causes and consequences of political conflict, violence, and instability.&nbsp; Expectations were that the STCM program would reduce the effects and causes of instability in the rapidly shifting environment of Sudan, particularly in the north-south border/transitional areas, the Three Areas (Abyei, Blue Nile, and Southern Kordofan), during the lead up to the southern secession referendum in January 2011 and potential independence of South Sudan in July.&nbsp; Post-secession expectations were that the program would further mitigate tension in the border areas, as well as Darfur and Khartoum.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although STCM is mentioned throughout the report as a 'program' it is better understood as a specialized tactical tool to provide strategically targeted support to transition and conflict mitigation activities.&nbsp; The independent performance evaluation of STCM will assist USAID/Sudan in determining: (1) the effectiveness and appropriateness of the overall approach to conflict mitigation programming and choice of funding mechanism; (2) the degree to which the implementing partner ensured a timely and cost-effective response to emerging needs in providing peace dividends, promoting community-level reconciliation, and strengthening local capacity for conflict mitigation; and (3) lessons learned that may guide the future of USAID/Sudan's conflict mitigation programming in Sudan.&nbsp; Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation question.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)</p>","Evaluated project title: Sudan transition and conflict mitigation (STCM)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-667-TO-13-00001|AID-RAN-I-00-09-00016|RAN-I-00-09-00016-00","","10/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JS5Q.pdf","927 KB","001891 - International Business and Technical Consultants, Inc.

"At first named RAIN (Revitalizing Agricultural/Pastoral Incomes and New Markets) and RAIN+ (Revitalizing Agricultural/Pastoral Incomes and New Markets for Enhanced Resilience and Recovery) in later phases, the relief-to-development program design aimed to comprehensively promote early recovery and increase resilience to external shocks in selected areas of the Somali and Oromia regions.&nbsp; It addressed the immediate needs of drought affected populations while also providing communities with skills and opportunities to reduce the impact of future droughts, violent conflict, and other outside barriers to development.&nbsp; The project therefore aimed to: (1) prevent food insecurity and livelihoods collapse via improved preparedness; and (2) protect existing productive asset base to strengthen and diversify livelihoods; and promote market-based business models, local economic development, and economic integration and trade with neighbors. RAIN's experience has demonstrated that even when environmental, economic, political and social conditions are stressed, market systems are dynamic and continue to operate in the stressed state.&nbsp; In addition to this, it has shown that even in the most complex and strained environments, if market systems are supported to overcome key obstacles, the private sector responds to opportunities and incentives to bring change to markets that work for the poor.&nbsp; This experience also indicates that&nbsp; subsidized service provisions have a distorting effect, undermining the viability of existing or emerging private sector investment.&nbsp; In order to prevent this, relief operations should be designed to meet immediate needs while minimizing distortions, avoiding undermining long-term programming and contributing to positive market system change, if possible.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Project title: Revitalizing agricultural/pastoral incomes and new markets for enhanced resilience and recovery (RAIN+)|Earlier project title: Revitalizing agricultural/pastoral incomes and new markets (RAIN)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","DFD-A-00-09-00087-00|AID-DFD-A-00-09-00087","","2/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","","Ethiopia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JSRQ.pdf","1,467 KB","013649 - Mercy Corps","","010865 - USAID.

"Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Collaborative Research on Adapting Livestock Systems to Climate Change focuses on the following goals: (1) improving the health and productivity of livestock of the rural poor, working with small-scale farmers to support their efforts to nourish their families and increase village resiliency; (2) supporting research that is informed by the local realities of small-scale farmers, with an interest in evidence-based solutions that are relevant and affordable; (3) increasing productivity that enhances animal, human, and environmental health, with a focus on innovative approaches that increase productivity, enhance health, and conserve resources; and (4) funding research where women play a central role, recognizing that women are fundamental to the success of farm-based initiatives and expecting research solutions to address gender gaps and address inequalities.&nbsp; A summary of this evaluation concludes that accomplishments in launching a set of research projects and capacity development initiatives made important progress toward program goals.&nbsp; Individual long-term research projects offer a range of approaches, however, the range of projects is broad, resulting in an overall research portfolio that is not sharply focused or coordinated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cross-cutting themes of gender, nutrition and climate change were not sufficiently integrated.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","Livestock|Climate change|Agricultural technology|Food security|Agricultural planning|Animal health|Agricultural management","Tanzania|Senegal|Nepal|Ethiopia|Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JSW6.pdf","1,318 KB","","","040181 - USAID.

"The Trusting in Youth in Zimbabwe (TYZ) program is based on the premise that if Zimbabwean youth are able to cooperate across lines of division to positively change their communities and improve their lives, they will less likely engage in violence. &nbsp;The polarized political context that Zimbabweans are currently confronting can be a fertile breeding ground for conflict, and may result in multiple challenges that impact negatively on all aspect of development in the country and beyond. &nbsp;The TYZ program seeks to address the risk factors that lead the young men and women to join violent groups and/or participate in violent activities. &nbsp;Key interventions of this program are: (1) creating livelihood opportunities for youth to reduce financial pull of violent groups; (2) enhancing the capability of communities including the youth to detect warning signs of conflict as well as situations where youth will be likely to engage in negative coping mechanisms; and (3) fostering positive social connections through utilization of peer networks as well as creating opportunities for youth engagement with government and other critical non-state actors. &nbsp;The mid-term evaluation of the TYZ program was designed as a participatory process led by an internal facilitator. &nbsp;The process-oriented evaluation provided opportunities for learning, growth, and reflection for Mercy Corps and their implementing partners' staff and stakeholders. &nbsp;The purpose of the mid-term evaluation exercise was: (1) to critically examine the methodologies and approaches used in key activities for effectiveness, quality of programming and the likelihood of the impacts being sustained; (2) to assess the relevance of the mix of interventions in light of the current operating context in Zimbabwe; and (3) to enable Mercy Corps and our partners to re-direct our future activities according to the needs and requirements. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","Evaluation dates: 20 to 31 January 2014|Period covered by the evaluation: January-December 2013|Submitted as: Trusting in youth in Zimbabwe mid-term evaluation report|Project title: Trusting in youth in Zimbabwe (TYZ)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-613-A-13-00003","","4/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","Youth|Communities|Violence|Conflict prevention|Livelihood|Employment|Peer teaching","Zimbabwe","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JSWD.pdf","332 KB","013649 - Mercy Corps","","008628 - USAID.

"This evaluation assesses the performance of the Somalia Legislative Strengthening and Elections and Political Processes Program.&nbsp; The program seeks to strengthen local and national capacity to promote good governance, a core component of USAID's strategy in the region.&nbsp;&nbsp;This three-year cooperative agreement was implemented by the Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening III (CEPPS III); the two implementing organizations for the CEPPS/Somalia award are the National Democratic Institute (NDI) and the International Republican Institute (IRI).&nbsp; The program had seven objectives -- three for Somaliland to be implemented by IRI and four for South-Central Somalia and Puntland to be implemented by NDI.&nbsp; The evaluators' findings and recommendations are summarized in response to&nbsp;three key evaluation questions: (1) were the development hypotheses that shaped the CEPPS/Somalia program design clearly articulated and justified, and do they remain valid for the current Somalia context and objectives; (2) has CEPPS/Somalia achieved the objectives described in the 2010 Cooperative Agreement and subsequent modifications, [and] have there been other notable achievements not anticipated in program, objectives and design; and (3) were the operational structures and implementation practices of the CEPPS/Somalia partner organizations effectively and efficiently contributing to achieving the project objectives?&nbsp; Findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided&nbsp;as detailed analysis by the evaluators.&nbsp; Annex VI is the CEPPS Statement of Differences in response to the findings, conclusions and recommendations put forward by the IBTCI&nbsp;evaluation team.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Cover title: Somalia legislative strengthening program evaluation : 2010-2013 Somalia legislative strengthening, elections and political process program|Evaluated project title: Somalia legislative strengthening and elections and political processes program","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-623-TO-11-00002|AID-RAN-I-00-09-00016|RAN-I-00-09-00016-00","","12/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","","Somalia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JSXC.pdf","946 KB","001891 - International Business and Technical Consultants, Inc.
