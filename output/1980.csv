"Evaluates project to institutionalize at Cairo University (CU) a capability to strengthen the ability of Government of Egypt (GOE) ministries to perform development research.  Evaluation covers the period 12/76-7/80 and is based on a review of project documentation, site visits, and interviews with CU, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and GOE personnel. The project's hypothesis -- that if tripartite MIT/CU/GOE teams research a developmental problem, a fruitful collaboration in development research between CU and GOE will be institutionalized -- generally proved true although the extent of institutional change varied among research teams.  Despite administrative changes in the project participants, the four project targets were accomplished: (1) tripartite research team reports yielded practical results -- eight of the 13 projects have led to at least one action decision in GOE ministries; (2) an estimated 40-50 CU faculty, 230 students, and as many as 350 Ministry personnel received some research-related training; (3) the Development Research and Technical Planning Center (DRTPC), was established as part of CU in 1979; (4) senior ministry and CU officials were made aware of the value of combined research work. Evaluators suggest that MIT, GOE, and A.I.D. develop a 3-year follow-on project to complete the institution-building of the DRTPC. Specific recommendations are, inter alia: that AID/W provide better project backstopping, link DRTPC with the National Technical Information Service, and establish regular liaison between DRTPC and USAID/E; that MIT increase formal training, establish targets for numbers and areas of training, and integrate research management and support into the DRTPC; and that DRTPC increase the representativeness of its board of directors, organize the DRTPC into training, research, and administration functions, and formalize criteria and procedures for project selection and quality control.","Evaluation period: Dec 1976-Jul 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Educational facilities|Social science education|Research methodology|Technical training|Technicians|Electric power|Energy planning|Energy policy|Housing planning|Housing policy|Pollution|Environmental protection|Road construction|Water resources|Natural resource development|Transportation planning|Transportation policy|Economic policy|Economic planning|Labor supply|Development research|Engineering research|Project change","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI711.pdf","1,688 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Pre evaluation data|Evaluation team|Onsite evaluation","","Hubbell, Robert L.|Arnold, Henry A.|Walker, Eric","","Jul 1980","","","","Evaluation of the Cairo University/Massachusetts Institute of Technology technological planning program","","PD-AAI-711","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUyNjk0","Egypt","2630061"
"Evaluates project to help Egypt expand poultry meat and egg production.  Initial evaluation, conducted by USAID/E, the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), and the contractor (MATHTECH), covers the period 8/78-12/79 and is based on a review of project documents and the first two interim reports. Despite logistical, administrative, and especially communications and transportation problems, the failure to include all relevant government entities in the Project Paper, the lack of qualified MOA data specialists, and major difficulties in identifying central sources and finding accurate data, the project is on schedule and on budget and has achieved its goals on a much broader scale than planned.  Project teams have:  developed an econometric model; reviewed poultry production (in Upper, Middle, and Lower Egypt), the poultry disease problem, MOA breeding programs, and the General Poultry Company (GPC); completed the initial phase of the sector analysis; and developed major recommendations in each of these areas.  Effective use of these instruments depends on improved participation by the MOA. On the debit side, administrative and site selection problems have delayed expansion of the poultry breeding/hatching farms at Fayoum, Sakha, and Inshas, so that this component cannot be completed on schedule.  Also, the need for remedial English-language training has delayed participant training, which was assumed by the University of Georgia after the University of Florida failed to adapt the unsuitable curriculum originally proposed. Rapid sector changes have eroded many project assumptions and increased the need for a national poultry plan. The project has taught that in implementing a project of this type, nothing should be taken for granted.  All data should be double checked and information should be acquired from as many sources as possible. Also, the resident administrative team should arrive on site at least 1-2 months before the consulting team and administrative and logistics systems need to be developed before work can begin.  When a project encompasses an entire sector as this one does, supportive industries and ministries also need to be included in the planning process.","Attached to PD-AAI-795|Evaluation period: Aug 1978-Dec 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Cottage industries|Poultry|Animal husbandry|Animal breeding|Animal health|Eggs|Sector evaluation","Egypt","","","000765 - Mathtech","","","English","","Indepth evaluation|Evaluation team","","","","24 Apr 1980","","","Compendium of reports, poultry improvement project, v. 1","Poultry improvement project, section I, preliminary evaluation report","","XD-AAI-795-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUyNzAx","Egypt","2630060"
"Evaluates pilot project to provide U.S. training to Egyptian middle managers in key economic sectors.  Evaluation covers the period 1977-6/80 and is based on document review and interviews with personnel from USAID/E, concerned Egyptian institutions, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale (SIUC, the contractor), and nearly 40 project trainees. Implementation was hindered by the false assumption that Egypt's economy is progressing more rapidly than in fact it is; by the vagueness and hence unverifiability of training objectives (to ""expose"" trainees to U.S. business practices); and by the lack of participation by host institutions due to the inability to define their role in the program vis-a-vis SIUC.  As a result, the project was carried out wholly at SIUC and key elements of the original plan, namely in-country basic management education and development of Egypt-specific case materials and of an indigenous institutional capacity for management, never materialized. A total of 96 managers (recruited ad hoc by SIU-C after the project planning council failed to establish a pool of potential trainees) eventually participated in the program.  Most trainees felt that they had increased their knowledge of modern management techniques and of functional areas such as marketing, finance, accounting, and computer sciences; case studies and management simulation games were viewed as most beneficial. It is recommended that the internship program be made more uniform and that participating U.S. companies be required to have a business paralleling that of the participant; the amount of classroom material be reduced or more time be allotted to cover it; learning materials be provided in advance; and that prerequisite courses be offered to ensure all trainees are similarly equipped.  Other recommendations are to allow host-country officials to participate in contractor selection (to obviate implementation problems encountered by SIUC due to its not wholly credible image); have U.S. contractors establish counterpart relations prior to the project; and ensure that trainees are proficient in English. Future programs (which should not be long-term) should combine efforts to improve individuals apart from their organizations and to help organizations become more effective within environmental constraints.","Evaluation period: 1977-Jun 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/OTR-C-1773","","6/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Mid level managers|Management training|Industrial occupations|Industrial development|Business enterprises|Management|Management education|Financial management|Participants|Institution building|Education for development|Problem solving|Accounting|Technical training|Language training|English language|Educational materials|Games|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI785.pdf","658 KB","000394 - Coopers and Lybrand Associates, Ltd.|008539 - USAID.

"Evaluates mangement of A.I.D. funds under the Government of Nepal's (GON's) Family Planning and Maternal/Child Heatlh project.  Special evaluation covers the period 1975-12/79 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with GON and USAID/N officials. The partially AID-funded project, as it grew and its budget increased over the last 14 years, has experienced problems with financial management. Funds have been commingled -- i.e., when monies are disbursed to the 47 districts, funding sources are not identified.  Of the 40 district accountants, 31 are untrained in GON accounting procedures, many have deficient bookkeeping skills, and turnover is high.  Salary and travel advances are frequently not cleared, and USAID/N release of funds is slow. Finally, past USAID/N audits have questioned the propriety of future A.I.D. support unless these problems are resolved and have suggested USAID/N cease funding projects with outstanding accounts after a set time period. Workable solutions were found for each problem.  An accounting procedure that ties expenditures to discrete funding sources and leaves a valid audit trail was devised.  A training program was formulated to introduce untrained accountants to GON procedures, upgrade the skills of trained accountants, and institute recording/reporting procedures by funding source.  Uncleared salary and travel advances for 1976-78 were intensively reviewedand the results forwarded to USAID/N which was in turn asked to write off a small amount of funds.  USAID/N's fund release procedures were reviewed and suggestions were made to accelerate the process.  Finally, the GON implemented the recommendations from the above audits to A.I.D.'s satisfaction. It is recommended that project officials hire an on-call fiscal management advisor and a chartered accountant.  In addition, A.I.D. should retain working papers of detailed budgets and, in the case of formal agreements, should budget funds according to the GON Chart of Accounts.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","family planning|Maternal child health care|Accounting|Financial records systems|Technical training|Financial management|Management training|Health care administration","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ059.pdf","1,824 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Pre evaluation data|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","Swezy, Curtiss F.","","Jun 1980","","","","His Royal Majesty's Government of Nepal family planning and maternal and child health project","","PD-AAJ-059","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUyNzM2","Nepal","3670096"
"Evaluates project to train community health practitioners and aides (CHP and CHA) and village health aides (VHA) to provide primary health care to Korea's rural poor.  Evaluation covers a period ending 5/80 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with trainees and with project personnel. The project paper defined the CHP's role as mainly curative, however, a mid-term assessment divided CHP duties evenly among preventive, curative, and clinic management.  Trainees were chosen from the areas they were to serve on the basis of attitude and experience.  The one-year CHP training program has three parts: classroom (for which texts were developed on internal medicine, surgery, preventive and emergency care, clinic management, and pharmaceutics), hospital internship, and field practice.  Due to a lack of instructors and available hospital space, half the trainees entered field practice without adequate preparation, and field supervision was limited. Nonetheless, all trainees were judged to be doing satisfactory work. The CHP evaluation (30% in-class exam, 70% clinical assessment) was judged well-designed and objective.  Guidelines for a revised CHP training program are provided. CHA's are nurse aides who undergo a 9-month training course. Turnover was high among CHA's who felt their duties required more varied training. VHA's are volunteers who perform simple health care and refer cases to the community health center.  Although the VHA program was not examined in detail, a large number of VHA's have been trained and the program appears basically sound. It is recommended that: the final external evaluation include experts in mid-level health manpower training and that the final training evaluation estimate the quality of preventive and curative services; a management and supply system and a standardized training and evaluation program for nationwide deployment of CHP's be developed; and that USAID/P take immediate action to provide additional technical assistance to the Korean Health Development Institute.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","7/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Health care|Rural areas|Health education|Indigenous education|Clinics|Health outreach services|Medical education|Curriculum|Health delivery|Logistics|Educational materials|Nurse practitioners|Nursing education|Health workers|Assistants|Community health workers|Curriculum design|Institution building|Beneficiary interviews","Korea R","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ054.pdf","2,205 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Pre evaluation data|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","Callen, William B.","","30 Jul 1980","","","","Preliminary evaluation of the Korea Health Development Institute community health practitioner training program","","PD-AAJ-054","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUyODA1","Korea, Republic of","4890710"
"A three-tiered health care delivery system has been established on the village, town, and county levels in each of three demonstration areas and are staffed, respectively, by village health aides (VHA), community health aides, and practitioners (CHA and CHP).  Of late, CHA curative contacts have increased dramatically in all project areas and CHA curative contacts have increased as well.  Town-level primary health units (PHU's) maintain excellent health records and along with county-level community health centers (CHC) possess ample, good quality equipment, although the PHU drug supply is excessive given the expertise of CHP's.  Care has been upgraded by adding better-trained physicians to the program, constructing modern and specialty clinics, practicing immunization, and maintaining a structured referral system. Preliminary studies show that the user rate in the target areas has increased substantially to 64% and that average health costs in the project area were lower than in a control area not covered by the project. It was recommended to consider assigning physicians to CHC's which offer a more stimulating environment and from where physicians could direct specialty clinics, review drug inventories and remove superfluous medicines; give CHP's and CHA's civil service status and adequate pay and increase efforts to retain them; have the Korean Health Development Institute provide technical advice and administrative control over the replication of low-cost IHCDS's and have the GOK vigorously pursue alternative funding sources to continue the project after A.I.D. funding ceases.  An outline for a final evaluation of the project is appended.","Evaluation period: Jan 1979-Dec 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-DSPE-C-0053","","7/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Clinics|Health workers|Assistants|Health outreach services|Evaluation methodology|Health facilities|Health care|Information and referral services|Maternal child health care|family planning|Immunizations|Tuberculosis|Disease prevention and control|Health delivery|Institution building|Pilot projects|Community health workers|Primary health care","Korea R","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ057.pdf","269 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Pre evaluation data|Onsite evaluation","","Irons, Edward P.","","30 Jul 1980","","","","Framework for preparing the Korea Health Development Institute's final report on AID project 489-U-092","","PD-AAJ-057","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUyODA3","Korea, Republic of","4890710"
"Evaluates three projects to develop Costa Rican institutional ability to assist small farmers.  Evaluation covers the period 1975-79 and is based on document review and interviews with host agency personnel and beneficiaries. The Agricultural Services Project, implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MAG) and the National Agricultural Council (CAN), had major difficulties due to programming deficiencies and invalid project assumptions.  Improvements occurred in regard to staff and farmer training, vehicle maintenance, and in dealing with market data; but did not occur in regard to livestock and crop production, disseminating information to farmers, or improving ratio's between fixed and operating costs.  MAG programming and budgeting probably worsened. Under the Cooperative Development Project, first degree cooperatives increased membership, social assets, and volume of operations; those of second degree lost ground.  The National Institute of Cooperative Development (INFOCOOP) grew stronger and more efficient. The Rural Municipal Development Project, designed to strengthen the Municipal Development and Training Institute's (IFAM) capacity to help local governments assist farmers, has left IFAM financially strong. IFAM has performed well on tax matters and financial analysis, adequately in technical assistance (TA) and credit operations, but poorly in planning and budgeting. AID-funded IFAM credit activities have been satisfactory, but AID-funded TA and training have not. Three lessons were learned: negotiate with borrower and implementing agencies at the project design stage on exact methods of disbursing funds; define aims precisely and program sufficient resources; and ensure the existence of host country political and technocratic will prior to institutional development projects. Recommendations are to: specify targets and inputs in support of MAG; provide CAN, an increasingly major development entity, with follow-on assistance, including short-term, specialized TA; ensure INFOCOOP directs new A.I.D. inputs toward policy resolution and toward strengthening cooperatives; consider technical and financial support to IFAM for a combined cadaster/land register/land tax improvement activity; and support IFAM's experimentation with grants and loans to municipalities.","Loan no. 515-T-025|Evaluation period: 1975-1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural cooperatives|Agricultural credit|Agricultural finance|Agriculture|Information services|Agricultural equipment|Equipment maintenance|Agricultural production|Agricultural management|Agricultural training|Agricultural policy|Agricultural planning|Farmer training|Financial management|Livestock|Animal husbandry|Institution building|Marketing|Financial institutions|Credit|Agricultural extension|Small farms|Farmers|Beneficiary interviews","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI764.pdf","5,601 KB","","","008533 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen small- and medium-size farms and businesses in Costa Rica.  Evaluation covers the period 8/79-7/80 and is based on document review and interviews with project personnel in central and zone offices. It is anticipated that as of 9/30/80, 87 subprojects will have been implemented in 88 communities in four zones involving 1,946 direct participants (365 of whom have received credit) and reaching 1,222 additional farmers.  Training has been provided to 27 technicians and to 1,085 persons enrolled in 45 courses.  The incomes of producers of sugar cane, chickens, fruits, livestock, coffee, and grains and for skilled tradesmen and those marketing baskets and brooms in Zone 1 have risen by 43-180%, a range of figures considered representative of the nation as a whole. The lack of field vehicles, the need for direct hiring of personnel, clarification of relations between the central and zonal offices, and training in methodology are outstanding issues which must be resolved.","Attached to PD-AAJ-402|Evaluation period: Aug 1979-Jul 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Indigenous education|Small farms|Farmers|Small scale enterprises|Agricultural product marketing|Agricultural production|Agricultural credit|Artisans|Income|farm income","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ402A.pdf","839 KB","008533 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop agricultural export capability in Honduras. Spanish-language evaluation covers the period 6/78-6/80; no methodology is specified.{In l980 the area seeded in tomatoes and cucumbers doubled with the yield/ha increasing 30% for tomatoes but decreasing for cucumbers due to low-density planting and inadequate fertilization.  The direct cost of tomatoes was lower in the ""Canas"" group than in the ""12 de Enero"" group because of better pest control and higher crop yield, although irrigation and and equipment costs produced higher indirect costs for the ""Canas"" group. The subproject for exporting processed products was a disaster as there was insufficient labor, yields were low, the technical assistance firm lacked local experience, and there was no price incentive since tomatoes could be sold in the local market for three times the price offered by the processing firm.  Packing and export was hampered by freezes during the harvest which required early picking and refrigeration prior to export, the Mediterranean fruit fly quarantine which blocked all tomato exports, equipment failures, and a virus at one of the sites.  Although the project lost money in l980, significant progress was achieved in organizational development, training, preparing packing plant managers, disseminating new technology, and achieving market acceptance of tomatoes and cucumbers.  The ""Canas"" group is ready for self-management.{The project should be redesigned to allow for self-management and self-financing within 3-5 years.  A packing plant should be constructed, a separate cooperative organization developed to manage the packing plant, and the area under cultivation should be expanded. For new farming groups, A.I.D. should establish as a condition of participation that individuals already have some knowledge of the project, and that farming groups be able to self-finance production costs for the first year and later provide minimum payments for packing. A.I.D. should organize courses, speeches, and other means for technology diffusion.  The ""Canas"" group should train contract labor who can later develop a farming cooperative in their own locality.","Attached to PD-AAJ-077","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Crop yield|Tomatoes|Vegetables|exports|Agricultural production|Cost studies|Information dissemination|Indigenous education|agribusiness|Agricultural cooperatives|Cooperatives|Management operations|Food processing|Agricultural credit|Agricultural technology|Technology transfer","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ077A.pdf","976 KB","008555 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of the University of Nairobi (FVM), Kenya.  Final USAID/K evaluation covers the entire project period (1971-6/78) and is based on a review of project appraisal reports and the contractor's final report. The project was only partially successful.  As planned, Colorado State University (CSU) assigned six qualified personnel to work at FVM, although two positions were held longer than planned,two were held for shorter periods than planned; two other positions not planned at all were also filled. Research projects fell five short of the target of 18; none were undertaken after 1975.  Research publications totalled 23, 18 of them authored or co-authored by Kenyans; 16 other papers were not published. Graduate student supervision was sucessful, with 23 students receiving supervision and 18 students sent to CSU for M.S. training.  To date, 13 have returned to FVM as lecturers, one has failed, and four are still studying. Unfortunately, limited funds and heavy work loads make it doubtful whether many will continue to the Ph.D. level (one already has).  As a result, returned lecturers, who have increased FVM's staff by 400%, are not academically qualified to replace CSU counterparts, and a total of 16 teaching posts remain open. The CSU team fulfilled its educative responsibilities at the undergraduate level, but taught no graduate courses - CSU's most important contractual failure.  Four graduate courses were prepared but they were rejected, either because of a lack of student interest or because they were inconsistent with the European graduate system.  Two major revisions led to a satisfactory undergraduate curriculum with three courses in the first year, four in the second, and seven in the third and fourth years.  The problem of adequate texts and materials remains, but is outside CSU's scope of work. CSU did not supply outside examiners for the project's first 5 years and those that were provided (from CSU) did not advise A.I.D. on the degree of attainment of the project's purpose.  This was CSU's second most significant contractual failure.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Higher education|Veterinary medicine|Faculty|Limited data","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI696.pdf","285 KB","001338 - Colorado State University","","008565 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to promote poultry production in West Africa. Special evaluation covers the period 1971-5/80 and is based on document review and site visits by an outside reviewer. The Government of Mali's (GOM) Centre Avicole Sotuba (CAS) is an unsound operation -- disease and morbidity losses are high (64%); egg production is low (18% or 66 eggs per bird per year); financial records are inadequate; facilities are overstaffed; products are sold below cost; and despite substantial GOM subsidies, the operation is losing large sums of money. Given this sad state of affairs, the evaluator recommends that the GOM sell the CAS to a private foreign or domestic investor for a sum based on CAS's future profitability or A.I.D.'s past contribution. Less preferred remedies include arranging a lease/purchase agreement or lease/rent agreement with a private investor, turning the CAS into a commercial egg production operation while continuing to produce feed, training the poultry and business management staff to upgrade the present operation, or closing down the CAS. If the GOM decides to retain ownership, the evaluator recommends that the CAS: (1) locate or train a poultry pathology staff; (2) improve the quality and nutritional value of feed, especially for parent stock and chicks; (3) buy spare parts for the disabled (three of five) incubators and a generator to power all the incubators; (4) debeak day-old chicks and segregate chicks by age to reduce morbidity and mortality; (5) increase the number and cleanliness of waterers to lessen health hazards; (6) have the Central Veterinary Laboratory conduct autopsies bimonthly in order to devise a disease and parasite control program; (7) import fewer parent stock; (8) reduce staff from 97 to 43 and locate a business-minded director and a deputy director with poultry management experience; (9) set up a thorough cost-accounting system; (10) produce high-quality, appealing eggs for public sale; (11) charge farmers for all services performed; and (12) require regional centers to buy chicks and feed wholesale and sell their products for a profit.  Finally, it is recommended that the GOM deny the CAS's request for an additional 800,000,000 MF investment.","Evaluation period: 1971-May 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Poultry|Chickens|Animal breeding|Farms|Poultry housing|Agribusiness|Food marketing|Feeds|Eggs|Animal husbandry|Food processing facilities|Disease prevention and control|Animal diseases|Project change","West Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI845.pdf","637 KB","000883 - A.L.

"Evaluates A.I.D.'s role in a joint A.I.D.-World Bank project to enable the Government of the Ivory Coast (GOIC) to design and implement replicable shelter projects for the urban poor. Evaluation covers the period 6/76-1/80; no methodology is given. Project progress has been slow because A.I.D. allotted insufficient time for a project requiring major GOIC policy and personnel changes, and because the GOIC implemented a government reorganization and faced serious budgetary constraints. Nonetheless, close RHUDO (A.I.D.'s Regional Housing and Urban Development Office) supervision and good A.I.D.-World Bank cooperation have kept the project on course. Regarding institution-building, the National Savings and Loan Bank is fully operational as both a central bank and a savings bank and is monitoring all projects financed with a GOIC guaranty.  The Bank has also increased its staff from 60 to 98, with all key positions except the Director of Credit filled by Ivorians, and more than doubled its savings.  On the other hand, rehabilitation of SOGEFIHA (a GOIC housing parastatal) has been hampered by its failure to raise state and private rents, secure a CFAF 9 billion loan from the Ivory Coast Sinking Fund, and decrease its short-term debt. In terms of the various housing subprojects, as of 7/79, 3,546 of 5,000 planned lots were upgraded; 1,900 of 3,980 lots received sites and services preparation; and 1,866 of 1,930 planned rental units were constructed to altogether serve 105,050 of a targeted 131,500 beneficiaries. Shortfalls were due to conflicts between project initiatives and other GOIC policy objectives (e.g., the Abidjan Master Plan). Training of Ivorian counterparts has been quite successful -- five have assumed full responsibilities, 10 are undergoing training, and two have not yet been assigned. In addition, the GOIC passed legislation establishing the principle of cost recovery for the upgraded units; introduced progressive rent schedules for low-income units; and instituted the principle of cross-subsidization of development costs in one mixed-income community.","Attachments: XD-AAJ-022-A, XD-AAJ-022-B|Evaluation period: Jun 1976-Jan 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Indigenous education|Institution building|Financial management|Economic planning|Fiscal policy|Savings and loan associations|Banks|Urban areas|Housing|Housing investment guaranty|Housing planning|Housing policy|Transportation planning|Transportation policy|Urban renewal|Urban development|Slum areas|Low cost housing|Beneficiary count","Ivory Coast","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ022.pdf","1,400 KB","002719 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Vetophar project to create a commercial distribution system for veterinary medicines in Niger.  Midterm evaluation covers the period through 11/80 and is based on site visits and interviews with project, A.I.D., Government of Niger (GON), and World Bank personnel and with local herders. Despite delays in construction and medicine delivery, by 5/80 a central veterinary pharmacy and two regional pharmacies had been constructed, staffed, and stocked; construction of a third regional pharmacy has begun. Staffing is satisfactory, but the financial recordkeeping system is inadequate and problems have arisen with the refrigerators, particularly at regional pharmacies. The most serious implementation problems have occurred below the level of the regional pharmacies -- neither distribution to small towns and markets nor an extension program to create demand for Vetophar's medicines has gotten underway.  As a result, Vetophar's sales amount to only about CFA 2 million per month and targeted sales of CFA 200 million will not be achieved by project end. It is recommended that the project:  (1) provide ongoing field staff training; (2) hire a short-term consultant to set up a financial management system; (3) hire an assistant to relieve the director of day-to-day administrative chores; (4) seek better coordination with the GON Livestock Service and donor-funded livestock projects (the two larger purchasers) in order to increase medicine distribution; (5) purchase larger refrigerators for the regional pharmacies and upgrade the central pharmacy refrigerator; (6) stock vaccines and drugs to fight livestock diseases (especially rinderpest, pleuropneumonia, pasteurellosis, and anthrax) and better mineral blocks and feed to counter nutritional deficiency; (7) better control insecticide use; (8) hire for 6 months a marketing consultant to conduct a market analysis, streamline procedures for sales to the Livestock Service and livestock projects, help set up a sub-regional commercial distribution system, and provide staff with short-term marketing training; and (9) establish its long-term commercial viability before constructing additional pharmacies.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Veterinary medicine|Disease prevention and control|Animal diseases|Pharmacies|Beneficiary interviews","Niger","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI735.pdf","1,180 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates logistics and supply components of a project to deliver primary health care services in Northern Sudan.  Evaluation covers the period 1978-9/80 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with USAID/S and Government of Sudan (GOS) officials by an outside review team. The project has been plagued by logistical and supply problems. The 25 project vehicles (carry-alls) received to date were fielded without being inspected by a mechanic or checked against purchase order specifications. Maintenance is inadequate -- 25% of the vehicles were out of commission after 3 months of use, in part because only 12 of 14 crates of spare parts were delivered to the Central Medical Stores (CMS) in Khartoum from Port Sudan. GOS medical supplies are also stalled at Port Sudan. In addition, many parties to the project--USAID/S, the GOS, the Ministry of Health, and the contractor, Medical Service Consultants, Inc. (MSCI)--are poorly informed of project progress and activities. Lengthy, although unavoidable, personnel vacancies have impeded project implementation, and the sound advice offered by the MSCI logistics/supply advisor has often been ignored. It is therefore recommended that: (1) newly received vehicles be compared against purchase order specifications and checked for proper mechanical operation before being issued to the field; (2) vehicles already in the field be properly maintained; (3) project trucks be used to transport medical supplies currently stalled at Port Sudan; (4) the two crates of spare parts lost in Port Sudan be located and promptly forwarded to the CMS; (5) project personnel at the national level meet regularly; (6) vacant project staff positions be filled on a timely basis; and (7) the efforts of the MSCI logistics/supply consultant be supported.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","12/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Health delivery|Logistics|Health vehicles|Transportation|Supply management|vehicle repair","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI053.pdf","238 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","Miner, Howard G.","","29 Dec 1980","","","","Evaluation of the logistic and supply components of the Northern Sudan primary health care project","","PD-AAI-053","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMDMx","Sudan","6500011|9365900"
"Evaluates project to institutionalize a natural resource assessment capability within the Government of Mali (GOM) -- the Institute of Rural Economy, from 11/79-9/80, and the National Directorate of Water and Forests Resources (NDWFR), since 9/80.  Evaluation covers the period 11/79-12/80 and is based on document review and site visits. The inventory of soil resources (SR), vegetation (VEG), and water resources (WR) will likely be completed, but the more important goal of developing the NDWFR's capacity for resource assessment and planning will not be fully achieved due to the project's unduly short duration; the delayed arrival of equipment and supplies (e.g., enhanced color imagery); insufficient training efforts; and inadequate GOM support of NDWFR personnel. Regarding SR, soil systems and land capability are being classified and work on the soil potential overlay map is 25% complete; however the planned atlas of 160 1:500,000 scale maps appears infeasible. Description of VEG is satisfactory and has improved understanding of the area's ecosystem, but biomass data collection has lagged. Inventory and analysis of WR has provided sufficient information on ground/surface water to produce the 1:500,000 WR maps, and because this component depends less on checking and interpretation of Landsat imagery, progress is ahead of SR and VEG. On-the-job, counterpart training is adequate but somewhat weak in map utilization and data analysis. Two NDWFR staff are scheduled to depart by 2/81 for U.S., M.S. training; others, after gaining more experience, will follow.  Only two of eight planned seminars have been held. In addition to numerous, detailed recommendations regarding SR, VEG, and NR work, it is recommended that A.I.D.: (1) allow a 1-year start-up period in future similar projects; (2) hire a hydrologist for 1 year to assure continuity in map preparation, adequate verification of field data, and sufficient counterpart training; (3) provide adequate time (6 months) and funds ($1.1 million) to collect bio-mass data, train NDWFR staff to utilize and apply Landsat technology, develop a manual of procedures and methodology, and conduct workshops on resource planning; and (4) fund a 2-year, follow-up project to develop an Office of Resources Evaluation, Planning, and Project Design within the NDWFR.","Evaluation period: Nov 1979-Sep 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource management|Natural resource inventories|Soil types|Geological surveys|Hydrological surveys|Project change","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI704.pdf","1,718 KB","008575 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish a regional office of the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) in Mali. Evaluation covers the period 6/79-11/80 and is based on site visits. Development of ICRISAT/Mali is progressing well with facilities in place and research, training, and extension efforts underway. Two laboratories and other support buildings have been built at the multidonor-funded Malian Semi-Arid Zone Research Center near Cinzana. Research emphasis is on improved varieties of sorghum and millet and on intercropping of these grains with cowpeas. The two chief staff members are highly qualified and have a harmonious relationship with the Malian Government.  Training of local staff is proceeding at five field stations in Sotuba, Cinzana, Baramandougou, Barbe, and Kopor as well as at ICRISAT/India and will eventually reduce the need for supervision. Finally, extension efforts are underway with farmer demonstrations conducted at the five training stations and with over 60 field tests completed in 1980 under the Semi-Arid Food Grain Research and Development Project. Regarding sorghum research, ICRISAT/Mali staff have surveyed local farmers' needs, identifed varieties resistant to witch weed (striga), developed a useful micro-technique for testing sorghum quality from a single head, and investigated the potential use of hybrids.  Research showed that elite millet germplasm is not transferable from other countries but must instead be developed through inbreeding of local stock; plans are being made for testing and possible release of a variety of finger millet, Eleusine Coracana. Farming systems research has included intercropping pigeon peas with other crops and conducting toposequence trials.  Future farm systems research will likely include rotations of planting dates, cropping sequences, and plant populations and the use of chemical fertilizer.","Evaluation period: Jun 1979-Nov 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Semiarid zone|Sorghum|Millet|cowpeas|Cropping patterns|crop rotation|Crop pests|Crop diseases|Varietal research|Cereals|Laboratories|Agricultural research|Agricultural extension|Agricultural training|Limited data","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI705.pdf","491 KB","001219 - University of Arizona","","","English","application/pdf","Limited data","","Webster, O.","","Nov 1980","","","","Project evaluation - ICRISAT/MALI","","PD-AAI-705","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMDQ1","Mali","6880219"
"Evaluates integrated rural development project in Zaire. Evaluation covers the period 6/78-8/80 and is based on site visits and interviews with project personnel. Project implementation has been delayed due to such factors as slow release of funds, currency devaluation, a high rate of anaplasmosis in the existing cattle herd, lack of organization at the cooperating training institution, and staffing shortfalls. Construction activities, however, are on schedule.  A nurse/nutrition trainee dormitory is 40% complete; a shop building for small tools production is virtually complete; and an agricultural utility building and three dormitories for agricultural trainees have been completed.  A dipping trough for tick control has also been constructed. Two agronomists and eight agricultural trainees have begun training in crop production; start-up of crop production extension activities is expected in early 1981.  Variety trials and seed multiplication of cowpeas and winged beans are proceeding well. These crops will be introduced as part of the extension program.  The cattle herd is being culled of diseased animals and healthy animals will be purchased for breeding stock.  In addition, a pilot animal traction training group has begun; two Zairois carpenters have begun small tools production training; and an agricultural consultant is taking a short course in fish culture. Despite the delays the project is well-managed and merits extension of time and serious consideration of follow-on efforts.  Prospects for successful village extension training in crop production are excellent.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Building construction|Agricultural buildings|Agricultural extension training|Limited data plus","Congo DR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI720.pdf","147 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Onsite evaluation|Interim evaluation","","","","19 Sep 1980","","","","Mid-term evaluation of integrated rural development project of Institute Medical Evangelique Loko (IMELOKO)","","PD-AAI-720","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMDQ5","Congo DR","6600082"
"Evaluates project to assist the Government of Tunisia (GOT) to expand family planning (FP) services.  Phase II of the midterm evaluation covers the period 1978-3/80 and is based on a review of the findings of Phase I of the evaluation (PD-AAJ-061) regarding project strengths and weaknesses; discussions with the staff of the GOT implementing agency, the National Family Planning and Population Office (ONPFP), officials of other GOT agencies, and medical faculty; and site visits. While quantitative and qualitative indicators demonstrate that the project has had a high level of success, new use of contraceptives has declined slightly since 1977 and large urban-rural and regional disparities in access to FP services persist. Among the recommendations for ONPFP's 1980-86 program are:  (1) prepare background papers on population trends and policy options; (2) consider making one person responsible for analyzing the FP-related needs of all GOT agencies; (3) establish a plan for national integration of FP and other health services; (4) increase the availability and quality of FP services; (5) strengthen special FP programs and FP support components; (6) develop the physical infrastructure to stimulate and service demand for FP; (7) introduce new programs, methods, and applications of the existing infrastructure; (8) strengthen and decentralize ONPFP management of FP services; (9) develop detailed plans for each major program activity and thoroughly analyze personnel and supply needs; (10) plan and implement a comprehensive strategy for penetrating underserved rural areas; (11) strengthen the information and education program, particularly in rural areas; (12) stimulate the participation of the Ministry of Health and of the private and commercial sectors in providing FP services; (13) strengthen data collection and analysis capabilities for research and evaluation; (14) improve biomedical research; (15) hire and train an adequate number of competent FP personnel; (16) develop national, regional, and governorate-level training policies, priorities, and plans; and (17) improve the FP training of physicians, paramedics, and GOT personnel. Numerous specific recommendations for achieving these ends are presented.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","4/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Family planning services|Health care administration","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ052.pdf","2,037 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Onsite evaluation|Indepth evaluation|Pre evaluation data|Interim evaluation","","Maguire, Elizabeth S.|Thorne, Melvyn C.","","30 Apr 1980","","","","GOT/USAID mid-term evaluation of the Tunisian family planning program report of the phase II mission","","PD-AAJ-052","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMDUz","Tunisia","6640295"
"Evaluates Special Development Fund Activites (SDF) project to finance local, self-help development activities in Costa Rica. Special evaluation covers the period 11/76-8/80 and is based on document review and site interviews with SDF committee members and project beneficiaries. A total of 207 project requests have been reviewed since 1977, of which 78 have been approved and funded.  In 1980, for example, of 63 requests analyzed, 16 have been approved, averaging $5,000 each, and including a cement block factory, a school, a public guest house in a geographically marginal community, a center for abandoned children, a playground, two nutrition and four community centers; and individual projects in industrial sewing, community elecrification, agricultural transportation, and chicken and pig raising.  Projects generally complied with A.I.D. guidelines in effectively meeting community needs, especially those of a social nature, and have strengthened beneficiary attitudes toward U.S. development efforts.  The frequent use and maintenance of SDF equipment and facilities-except in two projects -- attested to the deep community support for the projects. Since 62% of requests are rejected, it is recommended that the project's budget be increased or requests accepted for only one region per year.  Minor changes are needed in administrative procedures and in selection criteria. Processing should start immediately upon receipt of a request; continue with analysis, approval and follow-up activities; and conclude with the awarding of a plaque. Rejection letters should suggest openness to receiving future requests. The selection process should be both more systematic-- involving site visits and standardized data collection methods to allow for comparative analysis--and more rapid.  Explanations of approvals or rejections should be recorded and duplication of projects avoided.  Because production projects seem to have few direct beneficiaries and require more detailed feasibility studies and technical assistance, requests for such projects should be redirected to in-country development organizations.  The SDF committee took exception to the last of these recommendations.","Attached to PD-AAJ-237|Evaluation period: Nov 1976-Aug 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Community self help|Villages|Nutrition education|Educational centers|Small scale enterprises|Small farms|Farmers|Community participation|Community development|Management operations|Beneficiary interviews","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ237A.pdf","1,713 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","Ulrey, Tommie N.","","Aug 1980","","","","Report to the United States AID/Mission to Costa Rica related to the special development fund activities","","XD-AAJ-237-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMDYy","Costa Rica","5150133"
"Evaluates the provision of technical assistance (TA) in eight projects in Mali.  Special evaluation, for which no time period is given, is based on document review and on site interviews with USAID/M, contractor, and Malian Government (GOM) personnel.  Evaluation was prepared in response to audit findings that the host country contracting mode had reduced the effectiveness of AID-financed TA. Implementation delays have been very serious in most projects and are primarily to blame for reducing the effectiveness of AID-financed TA. The host country contracting mode was the main reason for neither the implementation delays nor the limited effect of TA, although it did contribute to delays in two projects. Rather, implementation delays and the reduced effectiveness of TA were due to:  poor GOM-USAID/M coordination in project design; inappropriate attitudes toward GOM-USAID/M-contractor collaboration in project implementation; inadequate planning during project design and implementation; misunderstandings regarding the purpose, costs, and use of TA; cross-cultural communications problems; unqualified and poorly trained GOM project directors and USAID/M project managers; and the precipitous switch to the host-country contracting mode. A series of 47 recommendations are offered for improving GOM-USAID/M collaboration and communication; devoting more attention to project implementation; upgrading project management and the quality of TA personnel; deciding upon the use of the host country contracting mode on a case by case basis; and improving commodity procurement.","Work Order no. 15","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/SOD/PDC-C-0219","","12/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Development project design|Development project implementation|Development project evaluation","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI754.pdf","1,632 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","Roush, James L.","Livestock","15 Dec 1980","","","","Development is a joint effort : discussion paper on improving the effectiveness of USAID-funded technical assistance to Mali","","PD-AAI-754","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMTIz","Mali","6880203|6880204|6880205|6880208|6880210|6880219|6880224"
"Evaluates project to establish a vocational training program in Lesotho. Evaluation covers the period 1/78-4/80 and is based on site visits, document review, and beneficiary interviews. The Lesotho Opportunities Industrialization Center (LOIC) has responded capably to a critical need for skilled manpower.  Feeder classes began 3 months late -- in 1/79; vocational classes started 3 months early -- also 1/79 -- to absorb 33 trainees transferred from the Lerotholi Technical Institute; and the Entreprenurial Training Management and Development (ETMD) program will be 17 months overdue when it commences 7/80.  The curriculum is well-rounded and unique among vocational schools in Lesotho.  As of 4/80, 18 students were enrolled in feeder classes; 85 trainees were in vocational classes (including 51 assigned to local construction firms), and 22 graduates had acquired jobs (68% versus the targeted 80%).  Employers were pleased and are strongly supporting LOIC's efforts.  Per trainee cost was high due to one-time, start-up costs and inflation but will decrease as enrollment rises. Nonetheless, inadequate training facilities are precluding higher enrollment; non-competitive salaries have caused substantial personnel turnover--9 of 28 local teaching and adminsitrative positions, including Program Director and ETMD Coordiantor, are vacant; and the Government of Lesotho (GOL) has been slow with financial inputs. It is recommended that: (1) A.I.D. revise the logframe to reflect more realistic targets, and foster improved communication among the LOIC, the GOL, and USAID/L; (2) the LOIC finalize the vocational curriculum, develop a comprehensive fund raising strategy, activate advisory committees, establish a task force to ensure prompt start-up of the EMTD program, and formulate a staff development plan, an operations manual, and internal evaluation and audit schemes; (3) the GOL provide financial support and adequate training facilities.","Evaluation period: Jan 1978-Apr 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/pha-G-1125","","4/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Business enterprises|Management|Management training|Employment services|Vocational training|Curriculum|On the job training|labor supply|Nonformal education|Institution building|employment|Training centers|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","Lesotho","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI883.pdf","1,066 KB","000912 - Opportunities Industrialization Centers International, Inc.","","000145 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to assist the research, methodological, and institution-building activities of the World Fertility Survey (WFS) in LDC's. Evaluation covers the period 1/77-7/80 and is based on visits to AID/W, WFS London Headquarters, and the UN Fund for Population Activities; a review of survey documents, and interviews with project staff. WFS sampling, training, field supervision, editing, and data processing standards were higher than in previous surveys, but data processing is still a major bottleneck.  Data produced were of high quality and will have long-term use in future studies of fertility and interrelationships between variables.  There are signs that other institutions are adapting WFS data collection materials.  In five of the six countries visited, fertility data were being used as a key input for population projections.  In three countries visited, data use could be maximized by textual explanations, policymakers being often untrained in statistics or demography.  To assure dissemination of data to those who could best use it, the publications mailing list should be revised. While WFS has built up supporting staff capability, the leadership in survey capability depends on a few people whose positions may be temporary. To maintain continuity and quality, WFS or another international agency should coordinate fertility surveys for some time. It is too early to judge WFS's contribution to improved capability in LDC data analysis.  A practical handbook for analysis of birth and pregnancy history should be prepared and more in-country seminars and regional workshops in data analysis held.  In fact, WFS should now shift its emphasis from data collection to data processing and analysis in order to help countries use these internationally standardized data to make cross-national comparisons and expand archival work. It is emphatically recommended that A.I.D. fund the WFS through 1987 to assure completion of current surveys; facilitate second-stage analysis; address the long-term future of the archives; review and revise the questionnaire, modules, and manuals; and promote further surveys.","Attached to PD-AAJ-133|Evaluation period: Jan 1977-Jul 1980|In: World fertility survey (International Statistical Institute)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","12/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Fertility surveys|Fertility|Demographic research|Infant mortality|Sociology research|Economic research|Institution building|Survey methodology|Information dissemination|Demographic data collection|Research methodology|demography|Limited data","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ133A.pdf","513 KB","","","000077 - USAID.

"Evaluates project implemented by the Center for Population Activities (CEFPA) to train family planning (FP) managers/instructors in LDC's. Special evaluation covers the period 9/77-3/80 and is based on document review, two site visits, and interviews with trainee supervisors and with 25% of the trainees. CEFPA has trained 252 persons in 11 training events: 175 in in-country or regional Basic Management Training Programs (BMTP), the project's key program; 25 in in-country or U.S.-based Training of Trainers Programs; and 52 in U.S.-based Leadership Training Programs. Training so far has had only a limited effect.  BMTP training seems little adapted to actual use, and criteria for trainee selection are in general too vague.  In Mauritius, even these vague criteria were not met -- six trainees did not work in FP and seven others did not hold supervisory positions.  Moreover, CEFPA's current approach will not lead to the institutionalization of the proposed Regional Training Center. There is little effective follow-up of specific programs. Nonetheless, CEFPA's experience and strengths (its strong board, dedicated staff, and good working relations with LDC agencies and Missions) should not be lost to A.I.D.  Before the contract is extended, however, CEFPA should: (1) limit trainees to those with appropriate positions and available time; (2) seek to increase LDC agency commitment to the training programs and to the use of trainees' skills; (3) make training materials more country-specific; (4) include an improved needs assessment and follow-up program in the training design, question trainees on the cross-cultural adaptability of their training, and make preand post-tests of BMTP programs; (5) drop plans for the Regional Training Center in Africa and concentrate on in-country programs; (6) require host countries, whenever possible, to agree in writing to institutionalize the BMTP function; (7) gain high-level commitment to training programs; (8) have trainee supervisors and top host country staff coached on the use of trainee skills; (9) prepare specific, written phase-out timetables; (10) use consultants, not additional hired help, to provide technical assistance; (11) formalize internal training debriefings; (12) assign one person to schedule and staff training programs; and (13) improve hiring practices.","Evaluation period: Sep 1977-Mar 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","4/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Management training|Indigenous education|Participants|Institution building|Family planning occupations|Medical education|Training centers|Teacher training|Leadership training|Curriculum design|Educational materials|Beneficiary interviews","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL243.pdf","1,135 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation|Multi country evaluation","","Munch, Neal J.|Minor, Keekee|Cheema, Jatinder","","Apr 1980","","","","Evaluation report on the Center for Population Activities : ""Training of Family Planning Managers""","","PD-AAL-243","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMTY4","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","9320627"
"Outlines preliminary design of a proposed rural extension and outreach project in central Tunisia.  Pre-project paper is based on field visits, meetings with Government of Tunisia and USAID/T personnel, and review of the project identification document (PID). The project will develop two entities - an Extension Support Services Unit (ESSU) to provide extension coordination and support and an Agricultural Extension Service (AES), consisting of field agents who will work directly with farmers. During Phase I, an ESSU communications unit will be established to collect, process, and disseminate information to field agents. In addition, new agricultural packages will be introduced to farmers practicing irrigation and trial plots will be established in dryland farming areas to test new cereal varieties. Training will be provided to extension personnel.  Phase II will continue work initiated in Phase I and will build the capacity of the communications unit to address general rural needs.  Two evaluation seminars will be held. Included in this paper are analyses of rural needs, land tenure, and the project's technical and administrative feasibility. Also provided are a budget and implementation plan.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSAN-C-0060","","4/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural extension|Agriculture|Information services|Agricultural inputs|Technical assistance","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ027.pdf","2,022 KB","001291 - University of Wisconsin at Madison.

"Evaluates project to increase LDC policymakers' awareness of the impact of population growth on development (RAPID project).  Evaluation covers period 2/80-ll/80 and is based on document review and interviews with A.I.D. and contractor, the Futures Group (FG), personnel. Since 2/80, the date of the last evaluation (PD-AAJ-056), interest in the project increased substantially and both the project and the FG contract were extended 2 years.  In addition, activities in LDC's were redefined in terms of preliminary and follow-up efforts, although the latter are still lax; the number of targeted LDC's was increased to 40; computers were installed in six of 20 eligible LDC's -- personnel were trained from four countries and maintenance is adequate; additional FG presenters were trained; A.I.D. Bureaus are helping to identify LDC interests; the frequency of RAPID presentations increased sharply; and FG progress reports improved. On the other hand, criteria for selecting LDC trainees were not prepared due to a shortage of A.I.D. manpower, and RAPID presentations in LDC's without Missions were and are not likely to be pursued since the presence of A.I.D. staff appears critical. It is recommended that: (1) LDC and Mission staffs better cooperate in preparing, reviewing, and presenting RAPID activities; (2) more care be taken in selecting LDC trainees and target audiences; (3) coordination of follow-up activities be improved; (4) an official exchange of letters be made with LDC's interested in assuming major responsibility for project activities; (5) requests for computer equipment and training by the Egyptian and Jordanian Governments and Missions be fulfilled; (6) A.I.D. requests for local RAPID presentations be better coordinated in order to more efficiently utilize FG staff; (7) computer equipment be installed and staff trained to make RAPID presentations in Washington; (8) FG progress reports emphasize major issues and related corrective actions; (9) the FG and A.I.D. devise adequate means for measuring the project's success; (10) average project costs per country be considered when determining levels of country activity; and (11) more attention be given to a long-term implementation plan to meet future demand for the RAPID model.","Evaluation period: Feb 1980-Nov 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","12/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Economic demographic interaction|Population economics|Economic research|Population policy|Population planning|demography|Population and demography|Information storage and retrieval systems|Demographic research|Simulations|Economic models|Sociology research|Demographers|Technical training","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI050.pdf","1,084 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation","","Seltzer, Judith R.","","19 Dec 1980","","","","Interim assessment of the rapid project","","PD-AAI-050","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMTky","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","9320637"
"Evaluates project to increase LDC policymakers' awareness of the impact of population growth on development (RAPID Project).  Evaluation covers the period l/75-2/80 and is based on document review and interviews with A.I.D. and contractor, the Futures Group (FG), personnel. While the project has promoted among LDC policymakers an initial awareness of population growth's impact on socioeconomic development, it is unlikely that the goal of integrating this knowledge into LDC government and A.I.D. development planning will be achieved directly and solely as a result of this project.  However, this is not to belittle the project's value.  Thus far, 20 LDC's have expressed interest in the RAPID computer simulation model, and another 10-15 presentations are planned.  Regarding project implementation, the FG has largely overcome the difficulties it faced in the first 2 years (e.g., staff turnover and poor subcontractor performance). Given this situation and the project's mandate to reach 35 LDC's, additional funds and a 2-year extension of both the project and the FG contract are required. It is further recommended that: (1) presentations of the RAPID model before the U.S. Government, LDC officials, and international agencies (e.g., the World Bank) be increased and additional FG staff be trained to make presentations; (2) the potential LDC demand for RAPID presentations be anticipated and preliminary analyses prepared for 20 priority countries; (3) FG staff responsible for follow-up activities make at least one preliminary fact-finding visit to each participating LDC and meet with host country counterparts; (4) A.I.D. reexamine restrictions on and prepare guidelines for presentations in LDC's having a limited or no A.I.D. Mission; (5) all Missions receive the interactive computer system used for the RAPID model and be assured of its adeaute maintenance and of appropriate training of U.S. and local staffs; (6) the FG update macro-files and provide sectoral analyses to LDC- and U.S.-based service units; and (7) the printed handout supplied at presentations be updated.","Evaluation period: Jan 1975-Feb 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","1/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Economic demographic interaction|Population economics|Economic research|Population policy|Population planning|Population programs|Economic models|Sociology research|Demographers|Technical training|demography|Population and demography|Information storage and retrieval systems|Demographic research|Simulations","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ056.pdf","1,178 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","000148 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop and apply improved demographic data collection and analysis techniques among Asian and Pacific LDC's. Special evaluation covers the period 6/78-2/80 and is based on visits to Indonesia and South Korea, document review, and interviews with East-West Population Institute (EWPI) staff and workshop participants. The EWPI has performed competently; the quality of its staff, resources, and research is excellent.  The 13 of 23 planned workshops that have been held on censuses, vital registration, and matters relating to the World Fertility Survey have been EWPI's strongest achievement.  Difficulty in ensuring participation of Chinese and other Asian scholars, however, threatens the value of the two workshops planned on China's demography. The EWPI has produced two reports on existing data editing and imputation software, developed and modified data evaluation and analysis software, and provided LDC's with technical assistance (TA) in computer programs and documentation. The EWPI has also published two periodicals as well as studies evaluating the demographic situations, census and vital registration systems, and population programs of various countries.  Some of the studies are excellent, but others are of lower quality.  To date, EWPI has provided only minimal in-country TA on data collection and analysis. Although the EWPI deserves continued support, the emphasis of the project should be changed.  Among the 25 recommendations are that:  (1) the use of workshops be continued and that they be objectively evaluated; (2) the emphasis of future workshops be on data analysis; (3) workshops be tailored to participants' skill levels; (4) workshops on China not be scheduled unless proven beneficial to A.I.D.; (5) use of existing computer programs be maximized; (6) A.I.D. specify the software to be written and documented by EWPI; (7) a future EWPI contract provide for analysis of 1980 Asian census data; (8) the high cost of EWPI research activities be studied; (9) sole-source funding of EWPI be re-evaluated; (10) in-country TA on software and data collection be intensified; and (11) greater efforts be made to ensure that appropriate LDC personnel, including women, participate in EWPI activities.","Assignment no. 582-023","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","1/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Demography|Demographic data collection|Research methodology|Technical training|Seminars|Population and demography|Computer software|Vital statistics registration|Population censuses|Planning|Beneficiary interviews","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAF595.pdf","783 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Multi country evaluation|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation|Evaluation team","","Presser, Harriet B.|Pullum, Thomas W.|Card, Josefina J.","","2 Jan 1980","","","","East-West Population Institute : mid-course evaluation on demographic data collection in Asia","","PD-AAF-595","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMjA2","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","9320648"
"Evaluates voluntary health insurance pilot subproject (SP) of the Korean Health Development Institute (KHDI) health demonstration project. Evaluation covers the period 9/79-4/80 and is based on interviews with project staff and a review of project documents. The SP has shown that voluntary health insurance in a rural setting is feasible.  The Okgu Medical Insurance Cooperative (OMIC) offers voluntary (Class II) insurance to the mostly rural residents of Okgu County; other insurers provide compulsory (Class I) insurance to workers in firms of 300 or more employees.  To date, 4,557 people (44% of the uninsured target population in the Deaya Myon subdivision of Okgu) have joined, compared to the 20% enrollment found in the only other similar Class II insurance experiment in Korea.  Although community support was gained using traditional methods, OMIC enrollment may be inflated since the KHDI paid half the premiums for 51% of enrollees.  The 87.6% payment collection rate and 0.8% attrition rate are considered acceptable. OMIC subscribers pay 400 Korean won per month (approximately 1.1% of their income), and OMIC in turn pays 60% of medical costs and offers a 10,000 won funeral grant to heirs of deceased members.  In comparison, Class I subscribers contribute 1.5% of their earnings; receive matching employer contributions; pay only 30% of out-patient and 20% of hospitalization costs; are not charged for certain services (e.g., dentistry, prescriptions); and receive benefits for 6 months versus OMIC's 90 days. Although there are inadequate data with which to evaluate current OMIC rates, KHDI estimates that a 50% rise in premiums would cover program costs; allow subsidies to be reduced; and maintain present benefits -- assuming static income and medical costs. It is recommended that: (1) the SP be continued 2-3 years to establish a data base for analyzing the cost of rural health insurance; (2) subsidies be gradually reduced until eliminated; (3) OMIC benefits be extended until comparable with Class I benefits; (4) enrollment rates be increased by intensive information dissemination and target group identification; and (5) studies be undertaken to determine the effects of reducing or ending subsidies.","Evaluation period: Sep 1979-Apr 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","3/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Pilot projects|Health care|Cost benefit analysis|Rural areas|Evaluation|Health care planning|Health policy|Health finance|Health insurance|Beneficiary count|Limited data plus","Korea R","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ053.pdf","263 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Onsite evaluation","","Fisher, Paul","","21 Mar 1980","","","","Review of the KHDI health insurance pilot project in Okgu County, South Korea","","PD-AAJ-053","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMjM0","Korea, Republic of","4890710"
"Evaluates project to determine fertility impacts of development programs in Asia.  Special evaluation covers the period 10/78-6/80 and is based on site visits and interviews with project officials and participants. The project has been reasonably effective in implementing A.I.D. activities in Asia.  Comparatively few projects have been approved as part of the studies program ($165,000 of a budgeted $395,000 has been spent) because of the limited number of high quality, responsive proposals.  Four to six projects are expected to be approved in the next few months.  Fewer workshops were held during the first 20 months than were scheduled because the first workshop was delayed until 11/79. Workshops have been effective in attracting projects for study programs and will be a useful resource for ensuring the feedback of research findings to the operational level of development.  Efforts to inform Missions of the availability of technical services were satisfactory. The major constraint to the use of technical services is the limited availability of Mission staff.  Information dissemination, a principal project purpose, has been the weakest component. To improve project performance, it is recommended that: workshops, technical assistance, and information dissemination be emphasized; solicitation of research be more direct; the possibility of developing case studies be considered; consideration be given to workshops based on project-supported case studies; researchers and persons responsible for project design participate in workshops; 2 or 3 programs be selected for concentrated technical assistance; A.I.D. personnel continue their involvement in project activities, especially workshops; increased staff time and effort be allocated to information dissemination (which should be tied to other activities); arrangements be made to continue information dissemination after project completion; and further funding of technical assistance and information dissemination be considered.","Evaluation period: Oct 1978-Jun 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","9/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Fertility|Demographic research|Sociology research|Classrooms|Information dissemination|Information networking|Development project evaluation|Impact assessment|Management information systems|Development project design|Development project implementation|Seminars|Population and demography|Technical assistance|Beneficiary interviews","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL246.pdf","1,489 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","Merrick, Thomas","","29 Sep 1980","","","","Evaluation of the population council fertility in development project","","PD-AAL-246","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMjM1","Development Support","9365900"

"Evaluates the functional literacy component of Operation Mils Mofti in Mali.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 9/78-3/80 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project, Government of Mali, and USAID/M officials. Although having only modest resources, the Malian Ministry of Education's Functional Literacy Department (DNAFLA) appears to possess a dedicated staff.  Regarding specific activities, DNAFLA has established eight different literacy levels.  Literacy zone chiefs were given mobylettes for use in visiting literacy centers and were trained in a 3-day workshop to be evaluators.  Information on participants' literacy levels and village data were gathered.  DNAFLA personnel visited villages to describe the value of literacy centers; 32 versus a planned 15 centers were built by villagers. Seven women animateurs were trained and are now functional literates.  Forty radio sets have been given to literacy centers to encourage listening as a supplement to the animateurs' instruction.  Training in the Peulh language was easier than in Dogon, although the latter is the predominant tongue, because Dogon has six dialects. Among the evaluators' recomendations are that:  literacy zone chiefs be paid on time; animateurs file quarterly evaluations and other reports on time; DNAFLA study the correlation between a village chief's charisma and support of the project and the success of a literacy center; a plan be designed to facilitate the entry of neo-literates into paraprofessional activities; and that A.I.D.  make some statement regarding continuation of the literacy campaign beyond the project's scheduled 3-year life.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Functional literacy|Educational centers|Literacy instruction","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI937.pdf","208 KB","008575 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop wheat varieties with high percentages of protein and of high lysine in protein without yield loss. Evaluation covers the period 6/66-12/79 and consists of a review of the contractor's final report by a subcommittee of A.I.D.'s Research Advisory Committee (RAC). University of Nebraska researchers succeeded in developing a stock of parent plant materials high in protein and lysine content for cultivation in developing countries.  Examples include Bezostaya 1 (a Russian variety) and Bolal (developed at Nebraska) for Turkey and a French-Hungarian variety for Afghanistan.  Researchers also bred varieties that were -- contrary to initial assumptions -- both high-yielding and high in protein, e.g., Lancota, which was distributed commercially in the United States. Researchers could not, however, find sufficient variability in lysine content to make breeding for high lysine as a percentage of protein a viable objective.  Other outputs included the holding of four international wheat conferences, publication of 65 documents, and the training of 10 foreign scientists. Although a network of test nurseries was established with 68 test sites in 38 countries, most sites were located in countries not listed in the ""need"" category.  The project's actual impact on developing country wheat production thus remains unclear, as does the country of origin or current responsibility of the 10 project trainees. In light of these considerations, it is recommended that any work beyond initial research be conducted within the country where the application is to be made; that methods of assessing the actual adoption of selected varieties, as well as the extent of acreage of the variety in-country, be developed; and that the funding of the nursery network be continued in order to best disseminate research findings.  It was further recommended that A.I.D. and RAC be more discriminating when continuing projects which have served their primary purpose.  The response to the discovery that the original project breeding objective was not a viable one should have been a narrowing of scope rather than the introduction of new objectives.","Attached to PD-AAJ-106|Evaluation period: Jun 1966-Dec 1979|In: Improved nutritional quality of wheat/Jackson, Robert I. :|Yohe, John M. : et al.","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","wheat|LYSINE|Dietary protein|Cereals|Agricultural research|Agricultural training|Plant genetics|Varietal research|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ106A.pdf","559 KB","002992 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve African governments' administration of development activities.  Evaluation covers the period 3/76-3/80 and is based on site visits (to Ghana, Senegal, and Kenya), document review, and interviews with government and African Training and Research Center in Administration for Development (CAFRAD) officials. Despite the strong desire for project management (PM) training expressed by participating countries, only 25% of project funds have gone to PM training and the project's overall focus has been shifted from PM training to general support of CAFRAD. Specifically, PM training was hampered by CAFRAD's limited PM capability; ill-advised assumption of participants' travel and per diem expenses; dependence on multi-donor funded workshops; and use of many consultants.  None of 15 planned training of trainers (TOT) regional centers were established, and only two of four planned TOT courses have been run. Participating countries' desire for CAFRAD to serve as a PM information clearinghouse has been poorly addressed. Moreover, despite CAFRAD's increased membership, its planning and control systems are poor and its financial status was weakened by the ending of UN Development Program support and by increasing arrears in member dues. It is recommended that: (1) CAFRAD establish a sound planning and control system for program and financial activities; (2) A.I.D. funds be placed in a separate account under strict A.I.D. control; (3) at least one functional sub-regional/national center be developed; (4) a PM syllabus be tested and documented; (5) a core cadre of African trainers be created; (6) a four-person, inter-disciplinary, English- and French-speaking team be developed to identify, evaluate, and distribute PM material, to provide communication channels with member countries, and to facilitate trans-country training; and (7) responsibility for expenses, especially travel and per diem, associated with workshops and seminars be transferred from CAFRAD to member countries.","Attached to PD-JAA-269","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSAN-CA-0180","","3/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Development project design|Development project implementation|Development project evaluation|Workshops|Education for development|Public administration|Teacher training|Management training|Development project management|Limited data plus","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDJAA269A.pdf","20,622 KB","000878 - National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration","","000013 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to build emergency access roads in drought-stricken areas of Tanzania.  Impact evaluation covers the period 1975-3/80 and is based on site visits, document review, interviews with Government of Tanzania (GOT) officials, and a survey of project beneficiaries. A survey of 23 villages was conducted to discern the impact of the 400 miles of project roads built 1975-6/79 (i.e., the South Road from Tanganyika Packers to Komolo and the North Road from Monduli to Loliondo) on infrastructure, economics, and the quality of life. Although the roads, especially in the South, clearly have greater use than envisioned, the absence of pre-project baseline data prevents detailed analysis. The GOT appears to value the roads highly -- it has placed the roads under the direction of it's Regional Engineer in Arusha to assure adequate maintenance, has added connecting feeder roads, and plans to widen the roads and add two bridges.  Although GOT projects are still based more on an area's needs than its accessibility, the roads have speeded implementation of these projects.  An extensive review of commerce, church mission activities, and tourism in the project area revealed that: charcoal burning and applications for land leases (near the South Road) rose; sand and charcoal transport improved; demand for trucking licenses grew; church activities expanded in the North and were facilitated in the South near Kibaya; tourism -- climbing, camping, and safaris -- increased near Lake Natron in the North; and non-availability of means of transportation has consistently impeded full exploitation of the roads. Village residents generally feel that the roads have had a positive impact, aside from a perceived increase in crime instigated by unwanted outsiders.  The anticipated problems of an increased number of visitors and of greater independence among children have not yet materialized but may become evident in the next 5 years.","Evaluation period: 1975-Mar 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-T-621-79-23","","3/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Roads|Access roads|Disaster relief|Sociology research|Economic research|Charcoal|Tourist industry|Road maintenance|Education|Rural areas|Health|public services|Public administration|Sampling method","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAH637.pdf","5,216 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation|Social science evaluation|Impact evaluation","","Hatfield, C.

"This report contains the project manager's (PM) response to the recommendations of an attached Special Evaluation (XD-AAJ-324-B) in a project to develop Tunisia's capability to improve the production and use of livestock forage and feed for small farmers. Although the PM believes that the composition of the evaluation team and the short duration of the evaluation resulted in an evaluation lacking the desired depth and understanding, he feels that many of the recommendations are useful.  Of the 40 recommendations made by the evaluation team, approximately half are considered valid and are being or will be implemented, e.g., establishment of a Seed Growers' Association.  Of the others, some, according to the PM, are based on misunderstood or faulty information.  For example, even though the project is -- contrary to the impression received by the evaluation team -- only secondarily concerned with livestock production, needs in the latter area require an M.S. not in nutrition, but in animal husbandry. Again, while the PM supports the need to continue the two training seminars, he feels they should encompass the project's entire subject matter, not just livestock. The evaluation team recommends that free inputs demonstrations be discontinued with larger private dairy farms and that demonstrations be held with herders owning 25 or fewer sheep. In response, the PM points out that free inputs to larger private dairy farms have not been general practice and that the average size of the flock within the integrated farm program is 18 head.","Office memorandum|Attached to PD-AAJ-324","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Livestock|Agribusiness|Forage crops|Feeds|Nutrients|Animal husbandry|Demonstration|Farms|Dairies|Seeds|sheep","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ324A.pdf","259 KB","008616 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop the government of Tunisia's (GOT) capability to improve the production and use of livestock forage and feed for small farmers.  Special evaluation by a USAID/GOT team covers the period 4/78-10/80 and is based on site visits, interviews with project personnel, and farmer questionnaires. The project has strengthened the following areas of livestock development: sector and farm management; participant and inservice training; extension system; forage seed projects; forage production (FP); and livestock production.  Progress has also been made toward institutionalizing an extension system for FP and use.  Specific achievements include establishment and staffing of a central Office of Livestock and Pastures to plan and implement livestock development projects; selection of 83 integrated farms for operation in 19 governorats and development of a detailed farm plan; providing U.S. training to 19 Tunisian technicians, with four receiving M.S. degrees and 15 receiving short-term training; expanding the extension system to include 58 extension agents assigned to 19 regional offices; development of inservice training consisting of seminars, contact with livestock professionals from Tunis, field days, and a technical reference handbook for agents in the field; increased seed production nationwide, along with a sound program for seed development and certification; increased numbers of forage demonstrations; annual assistance to over 3,000 farmers for establishing seed or FP plantings; yearly completion of the 2-year training program by about half of the participants and adequate replacement of trainees; adoption by neighboring farmers of demonstration farm activities; and implementation of four demonstration techniques to improve cattle production.  The team believes that farmer income will increase if the technology developed is correctly adopted by farmers outside the demonstrations and if it continues to be used when free inputs cease. A total of 40 recommendations are given.  See the abstracts of PD-AAJ-324 and XD-AAJ-324-A for resulting USAID/T action decisions and the responses of the project manager.","Attached to PD-AAJ-324|Evaluation period: Apr 1978-Oct 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/SOD/PDC-C-0230","","10/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Livestock|Forage crops|Seeds|Small farms|Farmers|Agribusiness|Animal husbandry|Farm management|Participants|Agricultural technology|Crop production|Demonstration|Farms|Institution building|cattle|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ324B.pdf","2,061 KB","000883 - A.L.

"Evaluates project to increase the quantity and quality of primary school teachers in rural Liberia as part of A.I.D.'s Rural Schools Program.  Impact evaluation covers the period 1958-1971.  No methodology is indicated. Although having a positive impact, the project was only a partial success due to flaws in design, implementation, and follow-up. Three Rural Teacher Training Institutes (RTTI) were constructed and equipped and two -- in Zorzor (opened in 1965) and in Kakata (opened in 1968) -- became and are still operational; 2,956 primary school teachers and 35 administrators were trained; an RTTI curriculum was developed; teacher certification standards were established; rural women were afforded opportunity for advancement; and a large number of rural children were able to attend primary schools. Nevertheless, the project was hastily and poorly prepared by A.I.D. which is faulted for: concentrating on making Liberia a foreign aid showplace; insisting its own views prevail; overestimating local absorptive capacity; attempting to use teachers as rural development workers when teachers could not -- because their low salaries often necessitated second jobs -- afford to direct such efforts; developing an RTTI curriculum based on U.S. models and not coordinated with the primary school curriculum; allowing inadequate time to institutionalize the RTTI's; and failing to maintain contact with involved institutions or individuals after project termination. Except for the party chief, personnel assigned by the contractor, Tuskeegee Institute, were of fair to poor quality.  After project termination, the Government of Liberia was unable to sustain prior RTTI funding levels (e.g., the Webbo RTTI remained unused until an access road was built years after the project).  Most RTTI graduates remained at their rural posts for the required 1-2 years, but afterward many moved to other, often urban, areas and jobs. Thus, the project taught that A.I.D. must: (1) be realistic in designing and planning projects and allow for an adequate gestation period; (2) select a contractor capable of providing all needed services; (3) conduct regular evaluations and assessments and not rely solely on contractor reports; (4) be prepared for mid-course correction or even major revision or termination of a project; and (5) above all, develop projects with, not for, a host country.","Evaluation period: 1958-1971","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Teacher training|Training centers|Primary education|Curriculum design|Education|Rural areas|Participants|Indigenous education|Institution building|Educational administration|Management training|Educational certificates|Student testing|Educational development|Educational facilities|Building construction|Beneficiary count","Liberia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG878.pdf","5,319 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Impact evaluation","","","Teacher education","Aug 1980","","","","Rural teacher training institutes : Liberia impact study","","PD-AAG-878","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMzUz","Liberia","6690012"
"Evaluates project to promote agricultural cooperatives (AC) in Liberia. Special evaluation covers the period 5/79-5/80 and is based on document review and site visits. For a description of specific achievements and recommendations, see the abstract of the attached PES (PD-AAJ-308). A rise since 1976 in the number of viable AC's (from 18 to 26), in the volume of produce sold through AC's relative to private agents (from 52% to 71%), and in the amount of sales (from $2.9 million to $19.7 million) shows growing farmer acceptance of AC's.  Many earlier problems persist, however, although improvements have been made.  More credit needs have been met, especially after Liberian AC operations took a major step forward with the beginning of operations in 1979 by the AC Development Corporation (ACDC); recordkeeping has improved (but is still not satisfactory); and improvements have been made in holding annual and board meetings and in assembling and handling produce.  Money continues to vanish from AC coffers, but an active audit program by the Ministry of Agriculture's (MOA) Cooperative Division (CD) is beginning to relieve the problem.  The Financial Advisor is helping AC's with purchase plans and some of the larger AC's with evaluations of loan requests to the ACDC.  There is still no evidence of budgeting and planning by AC management. Overall conclusions are as follows: (1) Farmers do want AC's and benefit from them. (2) AC management is increasingly aware of the need for an agricultural apex organization to represent AC concerns over produce prices and credit to the ACDC and the Liberian Produce Marketing Corporation (LPMC) and to establish a viable farm supply network, provide bookkeeping and audit services, and assist in programs to improve AC management.  (3) AC's are too often dominated by sub-agents who operate AC's for their own benefit.  (4) Efforts to improve the quality of coffee and cocoa by establishing purchases according to grade of produce and to create an effective CD in the MOA have met with little success.  (5) A means of monitoring prices farmers receive is needed, such as an LPMC requirement that all agents and sub-agents issue farmers a receipt for produce purchased.","Attached to PD-AAJ-308|Evaluation period: 1976-1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural cooperatives|Marketing|Auditing|Technical training|Management operations|Cooperatives|Institution building|Planning|Food processing standards|Accounting|Internal audits|Agricultural development banks|Small farms|Farmers","Liberia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ308A.pdf","1,181 KB","000238 - Agricultural Cooperative Development International (ACDI)","","008570 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to aid the Government of Lesotho's Ministry of Health (MOH) in providing primary health care (PHC) to rural areas. Special evaluation covers the period 3/79-2/80 and is based on site visits and interviews with MOH personnel. The MOH's plan to provide PHC using nurse clinicians (NC) and village health workers (VHW) has proved to be sound.  The MOH's currently understaffed Planning Unit was assisted in: drafting a national PHC program, promoting other donor programs, renovating rural clinics, forming a statistics sub-unit, holding management and curriculum adaption seminars, conducting long-range planning, and preparing legislative proposals.  Also, 10 administrators have returned from training in Botswana; MOH/private sector cooperation has improved; a plan and schedule to decentralize the MOH have been adopted; and 17 Health Service Areas have been designated as centers for PHC activities and administration.  Although a pharmaceutical production/storage/distribution system was set up, administrative problems (e.g., with accounting and supplies) have arisen at the Health Service Area level.  To prepare for the NC training program, enabling legislation was passed and procedures/policies were formulated. VHW's are being trained in 12 hospitals, and MEDEX modules are being adapted to Lesotho's specific needs for both NC and VHW training.  To replace those enrolling in the NC program, 161 nurse assistants (NA) were or are being trained. The evaluators favor proceeding with Phase II, but because of existing problems (inadequate maintenance, poor radio communications, high staff turnover, and sub-optimal control over PHC providers) recommend that the MOH: (1) seek budget increases to purchase equipment/vehicles and to provide incentives needed to attract and retain competent medical and support personnel; (2) revise participant training objectives; (3) reconsider disallowing trained nurses from receiving NC training; (4) review the future role of NA training; (5) better train dispensary personnel; (6) upgrade logistic and administrative support to Health Service Areas; (7) assess its data requirements; and (8) set up a vehicle repair shop.","Attached to PD-AAJ-286|Evaluation period: Mar 1979-Feb 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","2/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Rural areas|Health care|Evaluation|Nursing education|Nurses|Assistants|Paramedical education|Community health workers|Medical education|Curriculum|Transportation|Government departments|Logistics|Participants|Integrated health care|Incentives|Health occupations|Health delivery|Health care administration|Health care planning|Health policy|Institution building|Beneficiary interviews","Lesotho","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ286A.pdf","2,445 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","000074 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to support the Pan African Institute for Development's (PAID's) training, technical assistance (TA), and research efforts.  Special evaluation covers the period 1978-79 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews of former trainees. PAID is achieving project outputs and is making excellent progress toward fulfilling the project purpose.  Decentralization is being effected through the establishment of regional institutes in Ouagadougou, Upper Volta and Kabwe, Zambia to supplement those in Douala and Buea, Cameroon; PAID's Secretary General will soon relocate from Switzerland to Duoala.  Training targets have been both over- and under-achieved, reflecting each institute's search for the proper balance between long- and short-term training. The Douala institute was on target with long-term training (71 of 75), behind but improving in short-term training (125 of 560), and ahead of schedule for seminars (449 rather than 360 participants).  Field projects (3 of 8), case studies (8 of 32), and nine technical assistance (TA) projects (9 versus 6) are satisfactory.  The Buea institute is close to targets in both long-term training (114 of 134) and short-term training (12 of 30) and ahead in seminars (302 versus 250 attendees). Little was done on field projects and case studies, but TA projects were adequate.  Long-term training has not begun at the Ouagadougou institute, but targets for short-term training and seminars were exceeded (411 versus 304 participants), 19 training programs were conducted in six countries, and consultations and TA were double targets.  The Kabwe institute, established after the project paper was written, carried out a variety of short-term courses and seminars in East Africa and eight consultations in Malawi, Kenya, and Botswana. Finally, PAID's Central Program Support Service (SCAP), in Douala, conducted six seminars and performed well in evaluating the regional institutes; SCAP information dissemination efforts are weak. A total of 33 recommendations are made regarding PAID's need to strengthen personnel management; improve SCAP's activities; charge fair and uniform fees; begin long-term training at Ouagadougou; and follow-up on former trainees.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSAN-CA-0180","","4/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Integrated rural development|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Africa|Burkina Faso|Zambia|Cameroon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL328.pdf","970 KB","000878 - National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Interim evaluation","","","","Apr 1980","","","","Mid-term evaluation of regional rural development training; (PAID) Pan African Institute for Development","","PD-AAL-328","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzNTIw","Africa Regional","6980405|9360096|9365317"
"Evaluates P.L. 480 Title II food distribution program implemented by Catholic Relief Services (CRS) in Rwanda.  Special evaluation covers the program since its inception in 1963 through 1/80 and is based on interviews with CRS/R and Government of Rwanda (GOR) officials and site visits by A.I.D.'s Agricultural Assistance Officer (AAO) and his assistant. It was found that the CRS/R's Title II projects play a significant role in meeting humanitarian and GOR and A.I.D.  development objectives, especially in regard to A.I.D.'s emphasis on pre-school feeding and nutrition education.  The team recommends that this emphasis be continued, but that the GOR be encouraged to recognize the limits of Title II assistance. Concern was expressed that CRS/R's policy in the pre-school nutrition project may foster a sense of dependence on foreign food and so run counter to the GOR's policy emphasis on local foods.  A professional examination, conducted with A.I.D., CRS, and GOR involvement, of the project's economic and nutritionalimpact is recommended. The Growth Surveillance System seems to be working well.  To promote a spirit of cooperation, the team recommends that CRS/R share information from the System's Master Charts with the GOR's Nutrition Bureau.  The team also notes an alarming incidence of moderate to severe malnutrition among Rwandan children and recommends that CRS/R be encouraged to develop with the Nutrition Bureau a pilot nutrition therapy project. CRS/R has made noteworthy progress in dealing with shortcomings in commodity management and reporting, particularly by installing a more comprehensive inventory control system.  CRS/R should be encouraged to continue to submit quarterly Commodity and Recipient Status Reports to the AAO; the latter should, after reviewing the reports, forward copies to Rwanda/Food for Peace (R/FFPO).  Finally, R/FFPO should help CRS and the AAO determine the basis of ex tackle marine surveys by CRS/R independent surveyors and also recommend a procedure for the timely disposal of inland transportation claims.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace|Beneficiary count","Rwanda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ525.pdf","592 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Evaluation team","","Barker, I.","","Jan 1980","","","","Review of the CRS/Rwanda title II distribution program; January 14-23, 1980","","PD-AAJ-525","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzNTU1","Rwanda","696PL02"

"Evaluates and explains the modifications to a project to help the Government of Jamaica (GOJ) plan and implement development projects, especially through the action-training (AT) of GOJ personnel (assigning trainees to work on actual projects). Special evaluation, written by a project advisor, covers the period 1976-79. A local, multidisciplinary Project Development Resource Team (PDRT) was set up in the Ministry of Finance to conduct and develop an institutional capability to conduct AT.  To this end, PDRT introduced coordinated systems for project planning (based on a Project Profile - a standardized initial conceptualization of a project - that has unexpectedly received wide use in the GOJ) and approval, and is introducing systems of project monitoring. Within this context, PDRT has geared AT to five specific areas, preparing project profiles, project implementation planning, project management, project administration, and project appraisal. PDRT has used different kinds of AT interventions depending on whether stress was placed on action (project development) or training (skill enhancement) - AT's complementary, but sometimes competitive goals.  The specific content of any AT intervention is determined by the trainee's role in a project.  Seminars have proven to be a particularly effective intervention with senior officials.  As the project has progressed, the PDRT has expanded its role to become actively involved in project- and organization- related training of selected GOJ ministries and agencies.  Initially, there were frequent staff vacancies and uncertain career prospects at PDRT; however, institutional changes introduced in spring, 1979 have permitted recruitment to PDRT on a more flexible and permanent basis.  To date, PDRT has directly assisted a total of 114 projects (more than anticipated) through consultations (46), planning courses (39), and implementation courses (29).  A project planning and management series consisting of four manuals and 45 modules will be published soon. A PDRT unit was most effective when it was small, stable, set up in a central agency, committed to projects, led by a native, and oriented to planners and implementers.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Management training|Development project management|Development project evaluation|Technical training|Development project design|Development project implementation|Indigenous education|Institution building","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ607.pdf","641 KB","003235 - Development Program Management Center","","008563 - USAID.

"Evaluates the status of commodities ordered for three projects in Somalia.  Special evaluation covers the period through 3/1/80 and is based on a review of project files. Procurement delays were found to be common, as necessary commodities are often not stocked in the United States and those charged with procurement lack the authority and expertise to purchase substitutes. Burdensome rules and regulations, the limited availability of carriers and erratic transport, and poor order tracking have compounded the problem of slow procurement. The purchasing agent, in most cases the Afro-American Purchasing Center, is understaffed. In addition to addressing the above problems, it is recommended that technical expediters be retained to procure supplies for large projects.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Supply management|Procurement|Limited data","Somalia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ609.pdf","197 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Limited data","","Roxby, Edwin H.","","Mar 1980","","","","Status of commodity procurement for AID projects in Somalia as of March 1st, 1980","","PD-AAJ-609","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzNjQz","Somalia","6490101|6490102|6490103"
"Evaluates the impact on nutrition of a project to construct rural access roads in Kenya.  Evaluation covers the period through 1/81. Between 1/79 and 3/80, Kenya's Ministry of Transportation and Communication collected monthly and/or quarterly data on a random sample of 828 households within the impact areas of seven rural access roads in Kenya's Western and Nyanza provinces.  The seven roads span a wide variety of ecological zones, cropping patterns, access to services, and socioeconomic status.  Variables included road use, agricultural production, land use, household income, and expenditures. Anthropometric data on children were taken. Nutritional data taken from rounds 1 (1979) and 2 (1980) of the survey were extracted for validation and amended to agree with World Health Organization standards for height for age, weight for age, and weight for length.  The longitudinal data indicate that children in the impact areas have at least kept pace with normal growth rates in rural Kenya, and perhaps have made marginal gains in height.  Cross-sectional data show some nutritional differences before and after road construction. Evidently, in four impact areas (Busia, Kakamega, Kisii, and Bungoma) food consumption improved, while in three others (Siaya, South Nyanza, and Kisumu) deleterious nutritional patterns continued.  A third round of data is expected during 2/81 and 3/81.","Attached to PD-AAJ-642|Evaluation period: Jan 1979-Mar 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Roads|Rural areas|Nutrition research|Health surveys|Child nutrition|Children|Physiological growth","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ642A.pdf","4,959 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","","","McGuire, Judith","","Apr 1980","","","","Rural areas roads project; nutrition status of children 1979-80","","XD-AAJ-642-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzNjg5","Kenya","6150168|615T011"
"Evaluates the educational and health impacts of a P.L. 480, Title II mid-day meal (MDM) program for primary school children in India. Special evaluation is based on a review, in light of six possible program benefits, of quantitative studies (1969-79) of the MDM program's impact in five Indian states. The evidence provided by the studies, while meager and inconclusive, suggests that the MDM program represents an extremely inefficient use of A.I.D. resources.  Although most of the studies ignored the question of whether or not the program increased enrollment, all but one concluded that the program did increase attendance; only two studies, however, sufficiently documented this conclusion.  Only two studies examined whether the program reduced drop-out rates and none explored repetition rates.  No significant relationship between the MDM program and academic performance was found in the two studies examining this question. Reviews of the program's health impact by four of the five studies found little relationship between the program and anthropometric measures such as weight, height, chest circumference, etc.  This is not surprising, however, since two of the studies did not include significant numbers of nutritionally disadvantaged children and the food received by children aged 6-11 was only a small fraction of the recommended daily allowance. In none of the studies was the MDM's indirect impact on school attendance via improved health status systematically and rigorously studied. Although the lack of baseline and longitudinal data on the MDM program's impact and its expensiveness in relation to India's per student investment in primary education should make USAID/I and the Government of India skeptical about conducting the large-scale evaluation of the program that seems called for, the evaluator describes three options for such an evaluation:  (1) a retrospective analysis of district- or block-level educational data to examine how enrollment rates have changed in the last 20 years as a result of the MDM program and changing socioeconomic conditions; (2) a longitudinal analysis of the MDM program recently begun in Maharashtra; or (3) a cross-sectional analysis of the MDM program in three states.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Child feeding programs|School feeding programs|Food for Peace","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ650.pdf","4,166 KB","008557 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to expand professional agricultural manpower in Tanzania.  Evaluation covers the period 12/73-12/79 and is based on document review, field visits, and discussions with project personnel. Despite the adequacy of planned inputs, the project substantially failed its purpose.  The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) Training Institute (MATI) system was strengthened to only a limited degree. Improvements made in the curricula, teaching materials, and faculty of MATI's at Ukiriguru and Mpwapwa fell far short of the project goal of creating centers of excellence. Only 1,000 of a planned 1,900 students were exposed to expatriate instruction, and subject areas were limited. Only in the case of the number of participant trainees (61) and the conduct of a manpower survey and study were goals fully achieved. The project lacked a clear design (nor was it re-designed), project managers did not clarify goals, baseline data were not developed, and planned results were neither clearly articulated nor understood.  Lack of an implementation framework led to the unavailability and underutilization of inputs.  Intermediate outputs, such as returning participant trainees, were diverted from planned uses. Among 30 recommendations made for future projects of this kind are to: develop baseline data, an early implementation and management framework, and expenditure guidelines; set realistic goals linked to project inputs and to participant selection, placement, and training; conduct ongoing evaluations; allocate adequate financial and human resources; have U.S. technicians focus on institutional development; and fit training materials and equipment to project needs.  In regard to the MATI project, it is recommended that:  (1) A.I.D.  provide guidelines for use of remaining funds, request West Virginia University to fund the dissemination of teaching materials prepared by the U.S. technical staff, agree with the MOA on placing four participant trainees at project MATI's, and push for early publication of the manpower study team report; (2) the equipment control system at Ukiriguru be strengthened at once; and (3) the MOA and the Chief of Party reallocate excess equipment at Mpwapwa and Ukiriguru to other Mati's.","Work order no. 6","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID/SOD/PDC-C-0223","","5/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural education|Professionals","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ699.pdf","11,424 KB","006434 - Devres, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Onsite evaluation|Final EOPS","","Wood, Dennis H.|Wood, Robert H.","","30 May 1980","","","","Terminal evaluation of the agricultural manpower development project","","PD-AAJ-699","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzNzQ3","Tanzania","6210119"

"Evaluates seed development project in Thailand.  Special evaluation covers the period 10/75-10/80 and is based on a review of the project by two seed experts. Although slower than anticipated, progress has nonetheless been substantial:  3,000 MT of seed of six crops was produced in FY80 and demand for seed far exceeds production capacity; 3,500 contract farm families are participating in the project; a 250-member seed division has been established within the Department of Agricultural Extension (DOAE); four seed centers have been established and Japan has financed a fifth; two private seed companies are emerging; and seed has been supplied for special projects, especially during emergency situations. Delays in project implementation are due to the host country's lack of familiarity in procuring technical assistance and equipment. Major problems encountered to date include the lack of proper disposal of waste material and cull seed and the setting of seed prices below production costs. Potential problems are posed by the marketing and distribution of processed seed and the possibility of too rapid an expansion of the seed program. To improve project performance, it is recommended that: procedures be established for the immediate disposal of all waste material and cull seed; the Marketing Organization for Farmers be disengaged from the project but continue to function as a primary outlet for project seed; a seed promotion/distribution section be established at each seed center and within the central seed division office; seed prices be raised to cover production costs; seed production targets be revised downward to take into account project delays and private sector seed production; the seed division's management style be altered to fit the operating phase into which the project is moving; private sector partcipation in the seed industry be assisted and encouraged; the Royal Thai Government and USAID/T document the project's economic benefits and obtain data needed for planning future development of the Thai seed industry; and a working capital account be developed and established as a permanent fiscal mechanism to serve the needs of the DOAE seed division.  Recommendations are also made for seed production (9), project implementation (15), and inoculum production (3).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Seeds|Agribusiness|Distribution","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ966.pdf","695 KB","008613 - USAID.

"Reports on the effectiveness and regional performance of the Regional Road Maintenance Training Center (RRMTC) at Lome, Togo, in order to recommend appropriate A.I.D. action.  Report covers the period 11/76-5/80 and is based on interviews with trainees and visits to the Center and to four of the five Entente Council member states supporting it. Prior A.I.D. assistance to the Center terminated in 1976 without attention to Entente state recognition of Center diplomas for civil service purposes or to completion of an operational protocol between the Republic of Togo and RRMTC. Both of these issues were resolved in 1978-79, but between 1977 and 1979 attendance at the Center dropped from over 100 students a year to about 60, due largely to the diploma problem, discontinued participation by non-Entente countries, and insufficient qualified faculty. In 1978 the Center undertook an extensive curriculum review to upgrade courses and make its diplomas equivalent to traditional national diplomas. The first courses with the new program began in 10/79, but implementation of the revised curriculum is being impeded by continued lack of qualified faculty and, to a certain degree, by outdated and insufficient training aids, shop equipment, and reference materials. Entente country subsidies will support a student body of about 100; if enrollment increases beyond that level, the subsidies will have to be raised or donor assistance arranged. It is recommended that A.I.D. consider providing RRMTC with U.S. faculty, participant training for African faculty and Entente students, commodities (fixed shop and rolling motor pool equipment, reference books, handbooks, training aids, catalogues), and short term advisors for management review and evaluation/follow-up of Center graduates. Entente Secretariat and A.I.D. personnel should increase attention to Center activities and alumni. In addition, the Center should solicit assistance from other donors such as the World Bank or the European Development Fund.  RRMTC requests for additional infrastructure and for initiation of a well drilling course should be discouraged until the new program is operating effectively and Entente-country road maintenance training requirements are known.","French version: PD-AAX-286","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/SOD/PDC-C-0160","","6/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Road maintenance|Training centers|Curriculum|Educational reform","Togo","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ990.pdf","661 KB","009024 - Dimpex Associates, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","","","","","Jun 1980","","","","Evaluation of the Regional Road Maintenance Training Center at Lome, Togo","","PD-AAJ-990","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTU0MDMy","Africa Regional","6980135"
"Evaluates project to train development personnel within the Yemen Arab Republic Government (YARG).  Special evaluation covers the period 1/76-8/80 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with key officials. Although some training targets have been surpassed, others have not been met and the YARG is making inadequate use of participants' skills. Enrollment is ahead by 24 in undergraduate programs at the American University in Beirut (AUB) and by 20 in U.S. Masters programs; enrollment is short by 3 in U.S. undergraduate programs, by 3 at Arab universities, by 29 in short-term non-degree training, and by 5 in seminars and conferences.  The absence of YARG training priorities, the lack of follow-up, and the unfinished training of many participants make it impossible to assess project impact. The establishment of a Human Resources Planning Unit (HRPU) within the YARG Central Planning Organization (CPO) is still being planned; a YARG counterpart has been assigned to the HRPU.  The Yemen-American Language Institute (YALI) has unqualified teachers, poor teaching materials, and a high dropout rate.  Participant files are incomplete, CPO candidate selection procedures are unclear, follow-up procedures are non-existent, female recruitment is very low, and YARG enforcement of participants' return to Yemen is lax -- A.I.D. has recently requested reimbursement for a non-returning participant.  In addition, project management responsibilities are unclear, cost data are inadequate, conditions precedent have not been met, and YARG annual contributions are unknown. It is recommended that:  (1) more effective controls over costs, schedules, and performance levels be implemented, with monitoring of the latter by AID/W; (2) USAID/Y seek the CPO's commitment to a fully staffed and functioning HRPU and decide whether the top third of AUB sophomores will finish their B.A. degrees in the United States; (3) the YARG be held accountable for its commitments and establish training priorities; (4) participant orientations be instituted, participant files be upgraded and properly maintained, and a follow-up system for returnees be instituted; and (5) YALI's English-language training services be upgraded.  If the YARG fails to set training priorities and disbands the HRPU, USAID/Y should discontinue the project.","Attached to PD-AAJ-991","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/SOD/PDC-C-0193","","8/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Personnel development","Yemen","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ991A.pdf","12,182 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation","","","","Aug 1980","","","","Evaluation and field review of the development training II project; final report","","XD-AAJ-991-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTU0MDM0","Yemen","2790040"

"The Volta Valley Authority (AVV), created by the Government of Upper Volta in 1973 to settle and develop Volta River valleys recently freed of onchocerciasis, has encountered many difficulties in defining adequate farming practices and extension approaches.  This report explores these problems and evaluates the AVV program's socioeconomic impact. After analyzing the AVV's agricultural program, its monitoring and evaluation procedures, and the economics of AVV farms, the authors present their findings.  On the negative side, although cotton yields are good, cereals production is erratic and low; recommended crop rotation fertilization practice have not been followed; animal traction has been inadequately exploited; and the technical package being promoted is too complex.  Nonetheless, settlers are given farms large enough to earn them an acceptable level of income. Future land availability has already arisen as a problem and is tied to the larger issue of ambiguous land ownership in the AVV territory. Both female and young adult male settlers lose their traditional individual fields when migrating, forcing many young adults to leave AVV territory.  Social programs have been successful; settlers appreciate the availability of schools and dispensaries and are disposed toward group endeavors. The program has also fallen short of its expected national impact. The program has had only a negligible impact on reducing population pressures on the Mossi plateau and has not provided the anticipated cereals surplus.  The AVV has realized that traditional Fulani herders depend on the area more than assumed and that individual migration into AVV areas is rapidly developing. A different strategy might simultaneously promote agricultural development and preserve the area's ecology; the current approach is threatening soil fertility. The authors conclude that the AVV's experience again demonstrates the need for development planners to learn more about traditional farming systems and the results to be anticipated from introducing new techniques. The report includes 53 graphs, tables, and figures; survey forms and data on rainfall, the 1978 crop, and market prices are appended.","French ed.: PN-AAU-361","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/afr-C-1257","","6/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Population resettlement|Sociological surveys|Animal traction|Irrigated land|Dry farming|Economic analysis|Socioeconomic development|Social impact|Evaluation|Agricultural production|Agricultural extension|Farming systems","Burkina Faso","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAK549.pdf","3,522 KB","001005 - Purdue University.

"Because potential drought-related food shortages can be predicted through early warning assessments based on weather, climatic, and agronomic data, A.I.D. sponsored two projects to develop an early warning program in the Caribbean Basin and Sub-Saharan Africa, respectively.  This report presents the results of tests and evaluations of the assessment program. After a brief overview of the two projects, the authors describe the preparation of weekly weather assessments and monthly crop condition/food shortage assessments.  They proceed to verify the early warning assessment program's accuracy and utility during 1978-80 in the Caribbean, using historical and climatic analyses of Haiti covering a 35-year period; and in Africa, relying on documented reports from A.I.D. Missions and from the Food and Agricultural Organization. The authors conclude that the agroclimatic assessments can provide useful information 30-60 days prior to harvest, representing a 3-6 month warning of abnormal food shortages, in any country of the Caribbean Basin or Sub-Saharan Africa.  The program can potentially allow A.I.D. to achieve a cost-effective response capability in monitoring and assessing potential drought-induced disasters; increasing U.S. capacity to define disaster-prone conditions and recommend disaster avoidance measures; and in applying and transferring such information to developing countries and international organizations. It is recommended that future changes in agricultural practices or socioeconomic conditions be incorporated into the assessment procedures; crop condition assessment be more localized; historical yield indices be expressed as raw, percentile, and percent of normal figures; and that time series plots of meteorological variables be examined throughout the crop season.  It is also recommended that the yield moisture index be used as the primary indicator in the Caribbean and that the crop moisture ration be used in Africa. Appended to the report and comprising the supplemental volume are weekly weather assessment data for the two regions, an evaluation of the 1979 growing season, and a description of an episodal event data base for the Caribbean.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PASA CC/OFDA-999-79","","12/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Climatology|Soil erosion|Drought|Rainfall intensity|Rainfall distribution|Cropping patterns|Crop losses|Food supply","Caribbean|Sahel","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAK897.pdf","7,099 KB","000047 - U.S. Dept. of Commerce.

"While the design and implementation of women in development (WID) projects are flawed, these innovative projects do conform to A.I.D. mandates and with modifications are replicable.  So concludes this study of seven small-scale WID projects involving vegetable production and women's workload in Senegal, day care in Ghana, the cloth industry in Sierra Leone, and studies of the vegetable tannin and silkworm industries and of the role of women in Upper Volta. Regarding the projects' designs, in many cases outputs were not quantified, goals and purposes were unrealistic, feasibility studies (when conducted) were ignored, baseline data were inadequate, and input from the target population was insufficient. Implementation was often marred by the inadequate, inappropriate, or untimely arrival of inputs; by a shortage of project management skills; and by spotty participant involvement and host government support.  As a result, patterns of achievement were inconsistent. Significantly, there is no evidence that the projects altered the traditional attitudes of local men.  External problems common to all the projects included drought, illiteracy, and weak national economies. The author recommends that WID projects requested by potential beneficiaries to meet a specific need be adequately developed and funded, but that multi-sector WID projects be integrated into larger rural development programs.  Further, WID project designs should: include feasibility studies of the project's impact and realistic outputs, purposes, and goals; be allotted adequate time and money; and contain plans for interim and final evaluations.  Effective implementation necessitates delivery of needed inputs; monitoring of outputs, external factors, and potential problems; involving beneficiaries (including men) in project operations; and soliciting the support of host governments.  Finally, evaluators should use both quantifiable and soft (subjective) data and should be allowed sufficient time for their task. Appended are separate evaluations of the seven projects.","See also PD-AAG-648-B1","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/afr-C-1629","","1/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Rural areas|Villages|Income generation|Cooperatives|Feasibility studies|Agricultural production|Handicrafts|Health education|Technical training","West Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAK439.pdf","2,404 KB","000695 - Jeffalyn Johnson and Associates, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Evaluation team|Onsite evaluation|Multi country evaluation","","","Economics (General)","1980","","","","African women in development","","PN-AAK-439","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTU0NTkz","Africa Regional","6980135|6980388"
"High oil prices combined with a disastrous 1979-80 growing season have produced the most difficult economic situation in Senegal's history.  Against these gloomy facts, this study reports on current USAID/Senegal projects in livestock, grain, irrigation, and rural health. All programs suffered from implementation and productivity problems due to insufficient technical assistance from A.I.D. and poor management on the part of the Government of Senegal (GOS).  Full reports on all but the health program are impossible due to a lack of information collection.  Of the 26 watering ponds planned for the Eastern Senegal livestock breeding program, only two were dug in 1979 and only 10 more are planned for 1980.  Protracted labor negotiations, lack of beneficiary participation, and non-existent plans for meat marketing were the primary reasons for low output.  The grain production project, designed to increase millet production, diversify crops, and provide grain self-sufficiency, failed because unanticipated blockages throughout the grain production system (from seed delivery to marketing) reduced the amount of grain that went to consumers.  Further, consumer preference for rice and the lower cost of imported millet have called the whole project into question.  While the Bakel irrigated perimeters project did achieve some success (of farmers surveyed, 40-68% enjoyed a subsistence consumption surplus and 7-23% had a marketable surplus), insufficient worker training and a lack of timely technical assistance and provision of materials hampered project effectiveness.  The Sine Saloum health care project to establish a system of village health huts to assist in childbirth, dispense first aid and basic medicines, and improve sanitation, formally began in 1977.  Due to poor management, however, huts in only two of five target areas are functioning. It is recommended that A.I.D. stress increased rural productivity and improved project management; forge better linkages between individual projects and GOS macroeconomic needs; involve beneficiaries in the original project design; improve efficiency by increased use of local currency; and establish, wherever possible, collaborative project processes with other international donors.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Foreign assistance","Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ940.pdf","800 KB","008600 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to study laterite and lateritic soils as road and airfield construction material in Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America.  Final evaluation covers the period 6/67-2/75 and is based on interviews with persons in the United States familiar with lateritic soils and a survey of knowledgeable firms and organizations throughout the world. The laterite studies developed satisfactory criteria and procedures for identifying, classifying, and testing lateritic soils and tropical black clays.  Use of the design methods, specifications, and construction control procedures recommended by the studies has permitted locally available soils to be used successfully in an increasing number of tropical highway projects, with maintenance costs comparable to those for other materials.  Construction cost benefits have been realized on one out of four projects, for an estimated total of $1 million on 14 projects in Southeast Asia and Africa. The overall reliability of the laterite reports is good to excellent. The reports have received significant world-wide distribution. Recommended test methods, design procedures, and specifications are used by a third of the survey respondents. Use is greatest in Africa.  While the laterite reports are princupally used in the design, construction, and maintenance of highways, there is some interest in using laterite soils for home building and dam construction. It is recommended that performance studies on construction with lateritic soils and black clays be conducted after several years of service and that the use of laterite in constructing housing and dams be studied.  Future practical engineering studies on road surface treatment, soils of arid areas, and expansive clays are recommended.","Attached to PD-AAL-236","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID/otr-C 1626","","11/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Construction materials|Road construction|Soil research|Tropical soils|Beneficiary interviews","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAL236A.pdf","5,947 KB","000016 - PRC-Harris, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Final EOPS","","","Soil sciences and research","Nov 1980","","","","Terminal evaluation of lateritic soils studies","","XD-AAL-236-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTU0Nzcz","Technical Assistance","9310003"
"Since the development of the first family planning (FP) project implemented in Thailand in 1968, great progress has been made there in FP and the use of contraceptives.  Findings from an evaluation of Thailand's National Family Planning Program (NFPP) are presented in this report. The NFPP has had the following significant impacts upon populaion growth:  contraceptive use, especially of the pill, has increased substantially since the commencement of NFPP; fertility is decreasing faster in rural areas than in urban areas; the steady decline in the fertility rates since the mid-1960's has accelerated since NFPP began; and the population growth rate has decreased from 3.6% to 2.6% during 1960-75.  Despite these achievements, Thailand still faces unmet FP needs in such subgroups as the hill tribes and Indo-Chinese refugees. Also included in this report are findings from the NFPP statistics system and from operational research studies in FP conducted in Thailand; information on the current status of specific NFPP program components such as information dissemination and education, manpower training, and contraceptive services; and a list of sources of support for NFPP. For the success of this program to continue, increased support is required from the Royal Thai Government (RTG) and international donors. Other recommendations arising from this evaluation include:  (1) giving priority to geographic regions and subpopulations where FP acceptance is low; (2) emphasizing improved management and supervision at the village level; (3) including information about FP in health education programs; (4) giving all health education personnel formal training in rural health and FP delivery; (5) evaluating the impact of NFPP on health status, particularly with respect to maternal and infant mortality; (6) continuing pilot projects to determine the use of non-physician personnel in FP service delivery; and (7) continuing subsidy by RTG to health facilities for voluntary surgical sterilization.  Consultation reports and technical appendices are attached.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/pha-C-1100","","2/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning|Contraceptive agents and devices|Fertility|Population growth|Family planning behavior","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAH006.pdf","1,587 KB","000156 - USAID.

"At a recent workshop on pastoralism and African livestock development, it was agreed that livestock sector programs must be reoriented to make them more compatible with the social, economic, and environmental realities of arid and semiarid pastoral regions of Africa. This report summarizes the discussions of that workshop. Workshop topics included range degradation and productivity, program and project objectives, institution building, marketing, and case studies examining the SODESP Senegalese Project, the Maasai Livestock Project in Tanzania, livestock development in Kenya, and the evolution of livestock projects in Botswana. Consensus on the following points was achieved. (1) Quantitative data relating to pastoral systems are unreliable for two reasons. First, arid and semiarid regions experience considerable climatic instability. Data gathered at a specific time or location may not be relevant under future conditions. Second, data gathering techniques are insufficiently standardized to encourage comparability. (2) Management units for development interventions in livestock should be both small scale and based on existing cultural ecological systems. In large projects, decisionmaking is centralized and remote from individual herd managers who are locally in charge of herd movements and offtake. (3) Herd mobility can be due to crisis-survival mechanisms or effective strategies for long-term range exploitation. Planners must understand these processes and find ways of delivering quality-of-life services to mobile populations without constraining mechanisms of pastoral life. (4) Semiarid rangelands can undergo biological and climatic stress without long-term secular degradation, the very identification of which is difficult. Incorrect range analysis and treatment can exacerbate the semiarid ecosystem.

"Despite high levels of investment, Kenya's 10-year old water supply program has been unable to build successful water supply systems in rural areas; even as new systems are built, the number of inoperative systems increases. This paper evaluates the impact of the national program and the reasons behind its failure and makes policy recommendations for future A.I.D. water supply projects. The two types of activities supported by Kenya's Ministry of Water Development (MWD) -- systems built and operated by MWD and self-help (Harambee) water projects -- are discussed. Of special interest is a Harambee program financed by A.I.D. and the Cooperative for American Relief Everywhere (CARE) which succeeded in building only 1/3 of its scheduled projects, with increases in per capita costs of over 100%. Complexity of design, lack of supervision and government support, widely scattered site locations, and the large number of scheduled users were among the problems responsible for these and other MWD project failures. The MWD program's impact is analyzed in terms of reliability, service to users, and socioeconomic, health, and other benefits of rural water supply. The author's main conclusion is that delivering piped water to individual metered connections is inappropriate for rural Kenya due to the lack of engineers, high capital costs, inadequate operational/maintenance funding, and ineffective administration. Specific recommendations are: (1) that groundwater resources be developed and that use of improved shallow wells and handpumps be encouraged; (2) that new projects demand only as much institutional support as is available, while upgrading support capabilities; (3) that additional funding sources for the program be located; (4) that increased system reliability become a primary A.I.D. focus; (5) that health and sanitation measures be included only if existing community practices are deemed inadequate; and (6) that A.I.D. finance self-help projects on a regional or national, rather than a piecemeal, basis. Appendices are included on major donors to the Kenyan program, reasons for diesel system unreliability, water development expenditures, evaluation itinerary, and data collected on selected systems.","EVALUATION OF SIDA, CIDA, WORLD BANK, AND CARE PROJECTS.

"The current methodology for evaluating development projects -- even ""women-specific"" projects -- concentrates on logistical questions of timing and supplies rather than on social impact questions and is therefore inadequate to assess a project's impact on women. In order to develop a new evaluative framwork which addresses these inadequacies, this study reviews evaluations of 32 A.I.D. and private voluntary organization women-specific projects. The evaluations only indirectly assess women's concerns but provide sufficient information to analyze the success of projects in meeting three basic goals for women-in-development projects: (1) participation in project decisionmaking; (2) access to immediate project benefits; and (3) improvement in socioeconomic status. Specific factors which contribute to the achievement of these three goals are identified. For example, women's participation in the decisionmaking process is higher when projects are administered by women's associations. Women's access to benefits will be greater when project activities build on the prevailing sexual divison of labor and increase women's control over their own earnings. Social impact of projects tends to be greatest when women are organized for group action and are directed in activities carrying clear economic benefits. Indicators of physical, economic, and social well-being are presented for determining a project's direct and distributional social impact. It is noted that this evaluative framework is useful to assess not only the impact on women of any project (whether women-specific or not), but, more generally, the differing impact of any project on various social groups. The author stresses that factors which increase women's participation in development should be an integral part of project design and that women's economic and social roles in household and community should be taken into account. The paper's final section suggests methods of data collection to improve determination of a project's impact on women; interviews and group discussions with beneficiaries and the evaluator's perceptions are stressed over an objective or documents-only approach. A 50-item reference list (1971-79) is appended.","French ed.: PN-ABG-691","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Development program evaluation|Women in development|Development project evaluation|Social impact|Evaluation methodology|Development strategies|Data collection|Socioeconomic development","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAH725.pdf","2,591 KB","000164 - USAID.

"Since 1976, the Philippine Government (GOP), with A.I.D. support, has built or rehabilitated over 1,000 village irrigation systems. This document evaluates the two successive A.I.D. projects which have contributed to this effort. The evaluation begins with a brief description of the projects, in which small, subsistence farmers are encouraged to form cooperative organizations called Irrigators Service Associations (ISA's) in order to gain access to loans and electricity and to construct, operate, and maintain village irrigation systems.  The GOP provides loan monies and extension services and arranges for electricity to be brought to the area. The next section analyzes the economic, social, and political impact of these projects. Although irrigation provides the opportunity to grow two crops each year and this double cropping has led to increased on-farm employment, these effects have not necessarily guaranteed real income benefits for the farmers, particularly since they must curtail off-farm employment. Increasing costs of production, debt burdens from capital investments, and persistent technological and water management problems have dampened the rise in farm incomes. The small farmers also do not receive the higher price paid by the GOP exporting company because they cannot afford to adequately treat their rice after harvest. The improvement in family income that does occur is often spent on education rather than improved nutrition. A concluding section contains major findings and policy implications. Overall, the village irrigation systems have had immediate and visible benefits. Nevertheless, more extensive use of total farm resources (raising livestock), complementary off-farm enterprises, post-harvest grain treatment, and timely and adequate credit provision will be necessary to increase farmer income to a level enabling them to carry their debt. The authors recommend, therefore, that any future A.I.D. support concentrate on technical assistance to improve the productive capacity of farms in existing irrigation systems rather than continuing to expand the ISA network. Six appendices concerning related topics, including a 20-item bibliography (1975-1979), are included.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","IRRIGATION|FARM INCOME|Small farms|Farmers|VILLAGES|FARMING SYSTEMS|RICE|AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAH749.pdf","1,671 KB","000155 - USAID.

"Since the construction in Liberia of four all-weather rural roads, some villagers of the Lofa, Nimba, and Grand Jide counties enjoy increased accessibility to markets, schools, and health clinics. Because these projects have apparently succeeded in providing such services, other villagers are now clamoring for similar assistance. First, however, it is necessary to assess who the actual beneficiaries were and how they benefited. A five-person evaluation team found that substantial implementation and road design difficulties were encountered in construction of the four roads by local contractors under the supervision of the Ministry of Public Works; and that the roads are economically justified in terms of the volume of passenger and cargo traffic. It was also found that the roads have had a mixed impact. Improved transportation has bettered educational opportunities for children of tribal communities, stimulated the cultivation of the cash crops of coffee, cocoa, and rubber; and reduced not only produce loss due to spoilage but also cargo costs of agricultural products by 90% in more isolated areas. Perhaps the most serious, long-term impact which negates these short-term benefits is the change in the land tenure and use system. Land belonging to farmers' tribes has increased in market value due to its proximity to the new roads and hence is sought by wealthy Liberians. Their renewed interest in this land impinges upon the traditional land tenure system, forcing farmers to relocate to areas removed from the benefits the roads provide. The net effect is the loss of a fundamental component of economic security and social stability. If people are to take full advantage of the access the roads offer, questions of resource and benefit distribution need to be addressed. Other negative impacts were identified. Roads have induced expanded lumbering activity and altered cropping practices -- both of which threaten the environment. Vehicle repair costs have risen sharply due to the damage vehicles suffer from poorly maintained roads. Appendices discuss the evaluation's methodology; project design, implementation, maintenance and feasibility issues; and the impact of Liberia's coup d'etat on rural development.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Road construction|Land use|Small farms|Farmers|Environmental aspects|Maintenance|Farm to market roads|Roads","Liberia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAH750.pdf","2,282 KB","000156 - USAID.

"After years of dependence on declining mineral exports, the Government of Sierra Leone (GOSL) recently shifted its focus to agricultural development. The feeder roads projects reviewed in this report were intended to complement that shift. Overall, the Cooperative for American Relief Everywhere (CARE), which is implementing these projects, has performed well, successfully coping with funding delays and other difficulties. CARE has also displayed considerable innovation in several instances -- using Peace Corps and other volunteer engineers, involving local chiefs and villagers in construction and maintenance, and helping the GOSL to improve its road selection process. Whether the Ministry of Works will provide continued maintenance is a major question. Project benefits have included more frequent visits by extension agents, increased stops by light vans providing local transportation, increased ownership of motorcycles and bicycles, and greater access to health care. Fertilizer use and marketing of greater varieties and quantities of crops are also more prevalent. According to some reports, commerical activity (new rural markets, bank lending, new rice mills) has been stimulated. On the negative side, indications are that CARE roads may have precipitated shorter fallow periods for upland rice cultivation, greater rice scarcity, and increased swamp rice cultivation. These factors suggest that food crops are being replaced with cash crops such as cocoa, coffee, and oil palm -- and are thus associated with reduced soil fertility, erosion, deforestation, and increased exposure to waterborne diseases. During project implementation, there was a shift from labor-based to equipment-based road construction. Unfortunately, A.I.D. and CARE did little to document this shift. The author recommends that in future projects A.I.D.: (1) determine whether the agricultural development strategy supported by the road project will benefit the poor; (2) obtain a commitment from the host government regarding road maintenance; (3) carry out baseline and impact surveys of new and old roads; and (4) provide incentives to A.I.D. personnel to carry out impact evaluations. A more detailed version of this report is appended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Roads|Access roads|Road construction|Rural areas|Socioeconomic development|Environmental aspects|Small farms|Farmers","Sierra Leone","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAH751.pdf","3,149 KB","000156 - USAID.

"The greatest impact of the Potable Water Project in Thailand was not health-related, but occurred in the form of economic benefits such as increased gardening, livestock raising, and crafts production. This surprising conclusion is a primary finding of this project evaluation. Some 250 water systems were constructed under this project, with an additional 550 systems built later by the Thai government. An estimated 17% of the rural population is now served by piped potable water as compared to only 3% prior to the project. Most of these water systems are not only still operating, but also financially self-sufficient, with users paying full costs of maintenance and operation. With only a few exceptions, operators appear competent and motivated, and have received consistent supervision from the Rural Water Supply Section of the Thai Ministry of Public Health. The economic, social, environmental, and health impacts of the project are evaluated. Although lack of initial baseline and village-specific health data prohibit confirmation of claims that health has improved, the convenience of direct, reliable water delivery close to villagers' homes has resulted in considerable time savings and increased water use, both of which have contributed to the above mentioned economic benefits. At first, almost all socioeconomic groups benefited equally from public-tap access. But as revenues lagged, metered private connections had to be installed to finance systems' operations -- effectively cutting off the poorer villagers from service. The success of the water systems were found to have resulted from initial community contribution of time, labor, and funds; training and subsequent support for local operators; and the evolution of viable rate structures for delivery of water to rural households. It is recommended that piped water projects be considered and planned not just for health gains, but for their economic benefits as well. Other recommendations, some generally applicable to A.I.D. projects, others specific to water projects, are included.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Water treatment|Health aspects|Potable water|Water supply|Rural areas|Health","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAH850.pdf","2,420 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Although Morocco has a high per capita GNP relative to most developing countries, its income distribution pattern is skewed and the health and nutrition status of many is deficient. In this report, the impact of the introduction by Catholic Relief Services of nutrition education into 250 Moroccan social education centers (SEC's) which distribute PL 480, Title II food is described. To launch this education program, a nutrition institute was established at Marrakech to train a cadre of Moroccan women in basic nutrition and health. This cadre developed a curriculum of practical lessons in nutrition, sanitation, and the treatment of childhood diseases which were presented at monthly nutrition classes held at the SEC's. Class attendance was spurred on by the prospect of obtaining Title II food. There was a significant correlation noted between increased education and improved nutrition in the children taking part in the program. Moreover, mothers enrolled in the program demonstrated a greater knowledge of proper breastfeeding practices, appropriate pregnancy and nursing diets, treatment of infant diarrhea, diseases requiring vaccination, and animal and vegetable protein sources. Management of this program was exceptional, as indicated by prompt food deliveries, an excellent record-keeping system, uniform and accurate infant weighing procedures, weekly home follow-up visits for absent or sick mothers, and monthly visits from the provincial directrices. It was learned from the program that dependence on Title II foods inhibits the potential expansion of this program and endangers its continuation; Title II programs can be used to gather data for project design; and requiring all mothers to pay to participate in the food and nutrition education program kept the individual centers self-sustaining and created a sense of responsibility for the mothers. It is recommended that Title II organizations establish cooperative relationships with relevant ministries; that methods be devised to phase out the donated food component; and that attendance be increased without diminishing the education program's impact.

"Nearly 30 million people in the formerly isolated villages of North and Northeast Thailand have benefitted from the 8,000 miles of roads built between 1964 and 1974 under the Accelerated Rural Development (ARD) Project. This report focuses on the impact of ARD on Thais who experienced for the first time a wide range of opportunities within and away from their home community. ARD's institutional objective was to increase the capability of provincial governments to respond to rural needs by delegating to local governors the responsibilities of planning, designing, building, and maintaining rural roads, water facilities, and other public works. Although the degree of decentralization sought by A.I.D. has not been sustained, the existing ARD system does encourage local initiative. The roads have generally impacted favorably on those in formerly isolated areas. Continued education beyond the primary grades has been introduced to rural people, along with educational programs in health care and nutrition; and there have been increases in job opportunities both within and away from villages and in access to food, agricultural credit, inputs, and technical assistance. The land under cultivation and the intensity of land use increased dramatically wherever roads provided access to markets. Availability of water and better transportation increased rice production and encouraged crop diversification, especially of corn, soybeans, and peanuts in the North and of cassava and kenaf in the Northeast. The most serious negative impact of the roads has been rapid deforestation and soil erosion due to increased demands, stemming from population and income growth, for food and agricultural products. Also, the social benefits of roads have been somewhat offset by a spread of various epidemic and contagious diseases in areas from which it had previously disappeared. ARD has created a strong national institutional capacity to sustain the rural development effort, with most of the AID-funded equipment still in use in the project's original 31 provinces. Future ARD activities -- which will focus on maintaining existing roads -- will be constrained mainly by budget limitations.

"A survey was conducted of 20 Tanzanian villages in which A.I.D. had installed water systems using the four major technologies available for dry, wet, and mixed regions. Villages visited represented regions with different natural water resources. Three major results from this survey are presented in this report. On the technological level, it was found that of the types of water systems surveyed - those driven by diesel engines, gravity, windmill/diesel, and shallow well handpumps - handpumps represented the most appropriate technology due to their greater reliability and lower capital and operating costs. Shallow wells were also labor-intensive and the use of local construction and maintenance materials increased employment. A lesson learned was that a number of diesel and windmill/diesel systems did not function due to a lack of funds for fuel and parts. It was also found that most users were willing to pay operational costs if the systems were perceived as equitable and useful. Finally, on the administrative level, it was found that some donors set up separate parallel organizations with offices isolated from the office of the Regional Water Engineer who will eventually be responsible for the project. Without close coordination, successful continuation of the project is uncertain. Three recommendations were made: (1) A.I.D. should specify the use of shallow wells with handpumps for village water projects in Tanzania. (2) Users should pay for the system's operating and maintenance costs and be involved in the water supply decision. In addition, rural water projects should incorporate a method to assess users and to collect funds to cover operating and maintenance costs. (3) Project planners should ensure that the activities of the Regional Water Engineer are integrated with donor initiatives. This can be accomplished by training counterpart personnel, conducting periodic reviews to prevent duplication, and adopting or adapting the methods of donor projects into the regional program. Appendices on field studies, bilateral assistance, and technical requirements for A.I.D. potable water projects are included.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","WATER RESOURCES|WELLS|POTABLE WATER|Social impact|Evaluation|Water supply|Rural areas|Development project evaluation","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAH974.pdf","881 KB","000156 - USAID.

"The irrigation project evaluated in this report was designed to help South Korea become self-sufficient in rice and barley and to raise farm incomes. Fifty-five irrigation works including pumping systems, drainage, reservoir construction, and land reclamation were completed. All were small (and in many instances nearly complete) elements of a larger system. Rice self-sufficiency was achieved by 1975, soon after the project began. Barley production declined due to a high rice support price and a growing demand for wheat in urban areas.  Farm incomes increased. However, because farm incomes are directly related to farm size, the project affected beneficiaries unequally. The project's success is attributable to the high degree of engineering and administrative competence demonstrated by the Government of Korea, the effective delivery of extension services and agricultural inputs, and the high support price for rice. Lessons learned include the following: (1) More attention to overall economic trends and collection of baseline data is needed in the project design stage. (2) Small and medium irrigation schemes can be economical when added to an already effective farming system. (3) Because neither the bureaucratic nor social structure of Korea permits farmers and their wives to participate in project decisionmaking, community development outputs should not be expected from such special projects. (4) The assumption that a strong correlation exists between higher income and improved nutritional standards is false in non-subsistence economies. Korean farm families directed their extra income to the education of their children rather than to dietary improvements. (5) Unless the effects on women are considered in the project design, women's working conditions may deteriorate. (The labor-saving technology introduced in this project benefited men; women have undertaken a larger share of the field work as children have left home for school or urban employment.) Aging of the farm population as the result of increased education and migration to urban areas will be an important factor in future farm development. Appendices include related socioeconomic studies and a brief bibliography (11 entries, 1974-80).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","IRRIGATION|FARM INCOME|RURAL AREAS|FARMING SYSTEMS","Korea R","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAH975.pdf","3,083 KB","000156 - USAID.

"A.I.D.'s overall evaluation of its Philippine Rural Electrification (RE) program, consisting of eight successive projects, noted that it has had limited effect on the rural poor and the economic development process. This program began in 1965 and has since energized 844 (59% of the national total) Philippine municipalities, 9,088 (27%) barrios, 1,159,434 (20%) households, and 101 new cooperatives; resulting in a change of schedule for total national energization from 1990 to 1987. To improve the productive capacity of the poor, cooperatives were organized and lent funds to extend electrical power into their areas. Many of the poor, however, could not afford its installation, continued use, or more than one or two light bulbs a month. Community lighting, such as street-lighting, indirectly helped the poor in various ways, such as by providing greater personal security. Those with sufficient financial resources or skills were able to use the electricity for entrepreneurial activities. RE impact upon development occurred in areas with a concentrated population, available technical skills and capital, and access to large and diverse markets. Active promotion of electricity-dependent investments and projects also increased program impact. Conclusions reached are: (1) Economic growth requires not only electricity, but also the development of power-oriented projects and programs. (2) Electrification must be complemented by development efforts aimed at the poor if it is to directly provide higher productivity levels, employment opportunities, and better public and social services. (3) The service natur of cooperatives requires that a high priority be given to effective management -- even at the expense of beneficiary participation or democratization of the development process. (4) Productive power use and slower expansion rates encourage the financial viability of RE systems. (5) Because of the availability of other fuels, RE does not greatly increase energy demand. Appended are the evaluation's methodology, assessments of the financial viability and development potential of RE cooperatives, cooperative statistics, socioeconomic case studies, an energy impact statement, and a 23-item bibliography (1974-80).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Electrification|Rural areas|COOPERATIVES|SOCIAL BENEFITS","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAH976.pdf","3,016 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Rural development strategies have increasingly focused on extending modern production technology to improve the low yields of small farmers who produce most of the world's food crops.  This report evaluates a research project to increase small-farmer production in Central America by developing improved cropping practices.  The Small Farmer Cropping Systems Project (SFCS) supported research by the Tropical Agriculture Research and Training Center (CATIE) in Costa Rica on the traditional multicropping systems used by over 4 million small farmers in Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala.  Although progress was slow in El Salvador and Guatemala, the project succeeded in implementing on-farm research and developing area-specific recommendations.  The major shortcoming of the 5-year project was that it concentrated on the research process itself rather than on verifying and disseminating results.  Farmer impact was thus limited to the 75 small farmers on whose farms research was conducted.  Farmers in Nicaragua and Guatemala were active participants, whereas those in Costa Rica and Honduras remained largely ignorant of the project and disinterested in adopting alternative systems.  Test farm yields increased in every country but Guatemala.  CATIE's staff, training, and support capabilities were greatly improved and most national agricultural institutions involved were positively affected.  The team concluded that SFCS is a replicable model capable of significantly improving the lot of the small farmer.  Recommendations for future projects are:  (1) disseminate research results; (2) stress an interdisciplinary approach; (3) seek the active participation of farmers; (4) improve SFCS methodology by upgrading farm selection criteria, clarifying the relationship between on-farm and central station experiments, and increasing attention to the non-agronomic aspects of small farm systems; (5) promote maximum interagency collaboration; and (6) shorten the time lag between research, verification, and dissemination.  Appendices on evaluation methodology, project impact on CATIE, and CATIE's production data are included, as are reports on Nicaragua, Guatemala, Honduras, and Costa Rica.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural technology|Technology transfer|Cropping patterns|Small farms|Farmers|Multiple cropping|Research facilities","Central America|Guatemala|Nicaragua|Costa Rica|Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAH977.pdf","2,078 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Two rural electrification systems initiated in Bolivia in 1973 and 1974 are the subject of this report. By 1979, all distribution networks were completed, except in the La Paz region. Power was supplied to 42,000 consumers and was used primarily for residential lighting. Although demand outpaced supply, consumption per household was lower than projected and irrigation and industrial use was negligible. The preponderant positive impact of the projects was social. Household lighting improved the physical quality of life for 7% of Bolivia's rural population. Electric light was more convenient, less expensive, safer, and healthier than previous lighting sources such as kerosene and candles. Unfortunately, electrical power did not appear to play a catalytic role in economic development nor was it a precondition for it. Excessive technical design standards increased capital and operating costs of the systems. The premature termination of project financing for the initial hookups resulted in disproportionate exclusion of the poor from project benefits. The urban-rural rate structure, although beneficial, provided insufficient revenues for utilities to expand the rural systems. In addition, the absence of an aggressive promotion program, including a mechanism to mobilize financing by beneficiaries, resulted in a smaller number of residential and productive consumers than might otherwise have been possible. Several lessons were learned: (1) Similar projects should be located where a demand for productive use is evident from the productive use of other forms of energy. Alternatively, if the project purpose and probable impact is purely social, the system should be designed to maximize household connections. (2) Designers should introduce cost constraints into technical standards by allowing choices to be made by host-country technicians and by those who will be concerned with the utility's revenue-earning operations. (3) Electrification projects should be linked to other development activities. (4) A vigorous promotional program to teach rural people how to obtain and make productive use of electric service is recommended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Electrification|Rural areas|SOCIAL BENEFITS","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAH978.pdf","1,586 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Evidence indicates that improved water supplies in rural communities reduce the incidence of diarrhea. To demonstrate this phenomenon, two communities in Guatemala, Florida Aceituna and Guanagazapa, were selected for study due to their similar population, environment, and health characteristics. The former, which obtained water from shallow wells and rivers, served as a control to establish a norm for diarrheal incidence without project assistance. The latter was provided with a piped chlorinated supply system. Data from both communities were analyzed independently. Halfway through the project, a program to alter sanitary behavior and encourage latrine construction was instituted in Guanagazapa, allowing changes in diarrheal incidence to be ascribed either to water alone or to both water and the new program. The mean amount used per person over the project was 26 liters daily for each person in Florida Aceituna and 68.4 liters in Gaunagazapa. Eighty percent washed their clothes and bathed at home in Gaunagazapa compared to less than 1/3 who did laundry and 1/5 who bathed in the control village. Gaunagapaza showed a significant improvement in sanitary awareness over the project period and 79 new latrines were installed. Latrines continued to be built at a rate of two per month following the project. Almost no construction occurred in the control village. Data suggest that water alone was a sufficient condition to reduce diarrheal rates. Diarrhea declined substantially among the 1-45 age group in Guanagazapa, with children 1-7 benefiting the most. The health program and the increased use of latrines did not appear to decrease diarrhea notably. Data also indicate that water quantity rather than quality was responsible for improved health -- the amount of water used at home was three times greater in the experimental than in the control village. Water quality, however, while good at the tap, deteriorated in the transfer to domestic containers. Analyses determined that half of the samples from domestic containers had fecal coliform bacteria and three quarters had some coliform bacteria. Three appendices and a 17-item bibliography (1948-79) are appended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Water supply|DIARRHEA|Health|Rural areas","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ007.pdf","946 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Have A.I.D.'s health care projects helped alleviate malaria, infant diarrhea, and other health problems afflicting the people of Senegal? This evaluation of the Sine Saloum Rural Health Care Project to establish a network of village health huts to deliver basic health services provides a partial answer to this question. Despite difficulties from the start, several important achievements were realized. With the help of villagers, health huts were constructed and equipped in 200 target communities. Training materials and a records system were developed and a village health staff was trained in their use. Three conditions must be met, however, if the project is to succeed: the huts must earn enough to cover operating costs; government supervision and support must improve; and the medicine resupply system must function. Other problems areas include a high turnover of hut health workers; the close proximity of the huts to each other which forces some to close; and the high salaries paid to village health workers which drain the system's capital. Finally, the project's scale is too large and project management unsatisfactory. Although the huts have not operated long enough to make the project's impact clear, records show that visits to village health huts are often for the same treatment already obtained at larger, more distant health centers. However, the continuous closing of health huts because of poor project management may well negatively affect villagers' attitudes toward primary health care. Recommendations include: altering the health hut financial system to avoid collapse; closing health huts which overlap services; halting construction of additional health huts until the existing huts are improved; including a family planning component; obtaining firm assurances of budgetary support from the government; and strengthening A.I.D.'s project management team. Since this evaluation, several corrective measures have been made such as delaying project expansion; recruiting an experienced project manager; studying similar, more successful projects; and redesigning the project. A 24-item French and English bibliography (1968-80) and technical appendices are attached.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Community health workers|Development project implementation|Health care|Rural areas|Villages|Development project design|Development project management|Health facilities","Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ008.pdf","2,787 KB","000156 - USAID.

"The focus of current development investments in transportation has shifted from highways and railroads to low-volume rural roads, but few evaluations of the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of these roads have been conducted. This study reviews the available evaluative literature and presents issues to be considered in designing future rural road projects. Emphasis is placed on the broad social impact of rural roads and the diffusion of benefits to the rural poor. Impact areas in which roads are a significant factor are identified, e.g., agricultural production, employment, health, and education. Examples are offered of the potential benefits and problems of road construction in each impact category and questions are proposed for use in future evaluations. Roads must be location-specific in design if maximum benefits are to be derived, since roads are only one aspect of a region's development process. Roads almost invariably facilitate agricultural production and permit changes in crop composition (in response to increased market access), although it is usually the larger, wealthier farmers who benefit most. Roads also expand the use of technology by wealthier farmers, aggravating regional income disparities. Increased government extension services and cooperatives also tend to benefit the wealthier farmers. Increased availability of raw materials and markets encourages agribusiness and other commercial enterprises, but tends to discourage cottage industries. Road construction increases short- and long-term employment and land values and intensifies land use, while lower transport costs encourage a greater flow of consumer goods and travel. New roads also increase access to health, nutrition, and education services. Road development commonly causes local environmental problems such as deforestation, erosion, and decrease in soil fertility. The effects on national integration, community development, women, and minorities are too complex and regionally influenced to be generalized. Finally, criteria for designing projects in furtherance of social, environmental, and economic goals are suggested. Attached are a 170-item bibliography (1950-79) and lists of sources consulted.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Roads|Rural areas|Access roads|FARM TO MARKET ROADS|Social impact|Environmental aspects|ECONOMIC ASPECTS","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ135.pdf","5,064 KB","006434 - Devres, Inc.","","000156 - USAID.

"Although it upgraded a total of 181 miles of rural roads between 1972 and 1976, the Jamaican feeder roads project failed to have any demonstrably significant benefits. This report investigates the causes of that failure by examining the logic, appropriateness, and achievement of the project's goals. It was planned that road improvement would generate rural employment and help to stabilize the political climate. Furthermore, the roads were to facilitate market access, thereby stimulating increased agricultural production and income for small farmers. However, A.I.D. made a fundamentally illogical decision in relying on a feeder roads project as means to these goals. The projected labor-based construction mode was never actively pursued either by contractors or by the implementing agency and no significant employment was generated. Even had rural employment increased, the authors show that each step in the planned chain of events -- decrease in migration and urban crime, increase in tourism, and political stabilization -- was only loosely linked to the preceding condition, making their achievement highly unlikely. From the developmental perspective, the project neither lowered transport costs nor increased land under cultivation, once again because of a flawed program logic. The project also had limited (even adverse) social, environmental, and institutional effects. It demonstrated the inadvisability of relying on central departments to implement labor-based construction and the need to consider rural roads projects as a part of integrated rural development, not as isolated infrastructure. The authors conclude that the haste brought about by the project's high political priority ultimately caused its failure. A more methodical design and review process would have revealed the ineffectiveness of the rural roads approach and its propensity for failure. These conclusions are particularly important since politically-oriented foreign assistance from any source could encourage repetition of similar difficulties. Detailed project strategies and economic, social, environmental, institutional, and engineering analyses are attached.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Access roads|Farm to market roads","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ199.pdf","2,460 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Some 100,000 Tunisians living in dispersed rural settlements are using wells and springs that have been improved with U.S. assistance. This report evaluates a series of projects conducted by Cooperative for American Relief Everywhere (CARE), with partial funding by A.I.D. and assistance from the Peace Corps, in which 600 existing Tunisian water sources were renovated. According to the report's project implementation section, the projects involved little local participation. To control water contamination, the springs and wells were enclosed with relatively low-cost technology requiring little maintenance. Subsequent sections describe the projects' impact on availability and use of potable water, health and quality of life, beneficiary participation, and local institutions. On the basis of Tunisian records and standards, about 75% of the project sites were not producing potable water. Only 50% of the project sites visited were fully operational and adequately protected from surface contamination. No relationship between the CARE water projects and a change in the incidence of water-related disease could be determined. A negative impact on health may have occurred where users discontinued their own disinfection practices thinking the water was safe when in fact it may have been contaminated because project-provided treatment had ceased. Although most local disinfection and health education teams established under these projects are still in existence, they have not generally been effective. Included among the lessons are: (1) future AID-supported water projects should concentrate on increased water quantity, dependability, and accessibility; (2) project design should reflect demonstrated community need rather than prepackaged donor solutions; and (3) UN water quality standards will have to be scaled down if ambitious potable water goals are to be met during the Drinking Water Decade (1981-90). The authors recommend that A.I.D. work with the Tunisian government to agree on a long-term public health strategy, experiment with alternative potable water technologies, and evaluate projects in a collaborative fashion. Various project-specific appendices are included.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","POTABLE WATER|WELLS|QUALITY OF LIFE|Health|Water supply|Rural areas|HEALTH EDUCATION","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ207.pdf","1,490 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Although irrigation can greatly improve the world's capacity to feed itself by increasing agricultural production, most irrigation projects fall short of this goal. These failures are due sometimes to defective design, but more often to the expense involved, poor management and leadership, and improper use of resources. A sound system of evaluation can improve the effectiveness of these projects. This report examines A.I.D.'s current evaluation process and recommends revisions to improve project design. After reviewing the current status of irrigation in the developing world, the authors discuss A.I.D.'s evaluations, which typically concentrate on a project's conformity to its original purpose or on the performance of the implementing agency. The study found no evaluations which look comprehensively at a project's three stages -- preparatory, construction, and operational -- or examine and compare basic themes of irrigation project designs. Recommendations are: (1) that in order to improve project management and design, far greater use be made of evaluative data; (2) that evaluations focus on donor, host country government, and user needs; (3) that a grid of analytical questions/criteria be used consistently in evaluating each project; (4) that use of local public and private institutions in evaluating projects be increased; and (5) that evaluations stress management and environmental issues and farmer risk responses. Finally, evaluation guidelines designed around five major components are presented for routine use at each of a project's three stages. The five areas are economic viability; use of land, water, capital, and labor resources; performance and management of the water system; environmental effects (including health impacts); and social soundness, including effects on production and income distribution. At least one project from each of A.I.D.'s four regional bureaus should be selected for more detailed examination, and an overview of the irrigation in each region where A.I.D. has or will have irrigation projects should be developed. A 107-item reference list (1967-80) and annexes on related UN projects, environmental considerations, and criteria for project site selection are appended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","IRRIGATION|Development policy|CRITERIA|Development project evaluation|EVALUATION|Development program evaluation|USAID|Development strategies","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ208.pdf","1,767 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Severe erosion of irreplaceable topsoil in Indonesia decreases agricultural productivity, requiring annual rice imports amounting to 2.6 million metric tons. The Panawangan Pilot Watershed Project was designed to reverse this trend by establishing soil and water conservation practices capable of maintaining high production levels in the dryland farms of the Citanduy River Basin. This report evaluates the project in terms of its soil conservation practices, agricultural and community development programs, economics, and participating agencies. To reverse topsoil erosion in dryland areas caused by poor land use and increasing population pressures, the Panawangan Project has promoted improved soil conservation practices such as bench terraces, waterways, gully plugs, cutthroat flumes, and sediment traps, and has begun collecting soil erosion data. The project has also initiated an agricultural development program consisting of improved agronomic practices such as variety and fertility trials and multiple and monoculture cropping; a grass revegetation program; planting of trees as cash crops and for lumber and fuel; and livestock, beehive, and fish pond production programs. Besides providing technical assistance to farmers in the above and other areas, the project has actively engaged farmers in project implementation through community and farmer training programs, including special sessions to inculcate the project's basic concepts, especially by convincing farmers that the project will help increase farm production. Consultants have coordinated the activities of the wide range of local and national Indonesian agencies and research institutes involved in implementing this USAID-supported project. The project's most recent development (3/79) has been the establishment of nine mini-watershed demonstration sites. Government use of these pilot sites as a means of extending the Panawangan Project's successes is recommended. Also recommended is a low-interest loan program to enable dryland farmers to finance the inputs such as improved crop varieties and access to cooperatives and technical assistance which are required to increase production. A 31-item bibliography (1954-78) is appended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/SOD/PDC-C-0215","","1/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","WATERSHEDS|EROSION CONTROL|WATER RESOURCES|RIVER BASINS|SOIL EROSION|WATER MANAGEMENT|DRY FARMING|AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT|SOIL CONSERVATION","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ308.pdf","3,001 KB","000473 - Engineering Consultants, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","","","","Hydrology and water resources","1980","","","","CITANDUY RIVER BASIN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT; PANAWANGAN PILOT WATERSHED IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION REPORT","","PN-AAJ-308","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTY0NDI2","Indonesia","4970245"

"Evaluates a Save the Children (STC) community-based integrated rural development (CBIRD) project in Mahweit, Yemen.  Special evaluation covers the period 5/79-6/80 and is based on a review of project documents, site visits, and interviews with (ex) project staff and project-related personnel. As a result of a 6/79 USAID/Y-STC special evaluation, the project was extensively redefined in 6/80, with new activities in training, outreach, and project management.  Nonetheless, the project's nutrition and women's centers were forcefully closed in 2/80 by representatives of a community faction and STC staff left Mahweit on 4/26, 4 days before a deadline imposed by local political leadership.  Under local pressure, the Governor had demanded that the project entirely finance a Mahweit sewer system. When STC rejected this demand as beyond the project's means and scope, locals were incredulous, and asked for compliance or withdrawal of the ""American project"". The underlying problem seems to be that Mahweit lacked the very features - social homogeneity, common goals, and egalitarian ideals and institutions - presupposed by STC's CBIRD philosophy.  As a result, STC could not successfully develop processes rather than end products, involve the highly factionalized local community in the project, undertake several tasks simultaneously, expand women's roles, or generate self-help activities, especially without help from the central government.  Moreover, STC staff lacked the experience to adapt the CBIRD approach to the local context.  The project's very first output, a youth center, which had been built to satisfy a perceived need for concrete results, allied the project with one local faction.  Later, disputes arose over programs for women, road projects which crossed private land, and finally, over water projects.  (Five successful small water projects were, however, built in the outlying Charbi area). The attitude of the Governor and the local climate make resumption of the project in Mahweit town in any form highly unlikely.  Government officials are willing, however, to allow resumption of the project in a modified form in Mahweit Province.  A final option is to terminate the project at this juncture and reschedule the remaining funds.","Companion project evaluation summary: PD-AAM-269|Evaluation period: May 1979-Jun 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Community development|Project change|Limited data plus","Yemen","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL463.pdf","2,227 KB","001407 - Save the Children (U.S.)","","000133 - USAID.

"Presents consultants' report on designing a study to evaluate the health impact of the Surakarta (Indonesia) Water System project; the report also presents recommendations for improving the project itself. Report is based on review of project documentation and results of a questionnaire administered onsite. In designing the planned evaluation, the following are recommended: (1) include a longitudinal study in addition to the planned baseline and follow-up surveys since currently available surveillance data are of little use; (2) hire two epidemiologists, a sanitary engineer, and field workers; (3) identify cohorts of 200 families with at least one child aged 0-4 for weekly evaluation of illness and quarterly evaluation of water and sanitation facility usage; (4) develop a definition of diarrhea; (5) conduct an on-going analysis of the data collected; (6) measure the heights and weights of children aged 0-4 twice yearly; (7) develop and test reporting forms on enteric diseases; (8) work with the city to standardize reporting of water-related diseases; (9) identify or develop a local laboratory capability; and (10) develop techniques to monitor the water/sanitation behavior of young children. To improve the project, it is recommended that:  (1) community leaders and personnel from other local water/sanitation activities be involved; (2) a health education component be added; (3) avaliable data on population and incidence of disease be used to determine which areas of the city of Surakarta are to be included; (4) a mechanism for collecting routine water quality data be developed; and (5) capabilities to operate and maintain as well as to evaluate new and existing to operate and maintain as well as to evaluate new and existing water systems be created.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Evaluation|Water supply structures|Water supply|Health|Urban areas","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL462.pdf","16,883 KB","008558 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the Council of Voluntary Social Services (CVSS) and select CVSS member agencies promote efforts by Jamaican PVO's on the priority problems of unemployment, children/youth, and rural outreach.  Special evaluation covers the period 10/77-9/80 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel and beneficiaries. Results of a survey of CVSS activities in the three areas noted above show that CVSS has met the objectives of the grant agreement to an appreciable degree, although success has been less than it should have been.  The main problems overall have been inherent weaknesses in the structuring of the CVSS and its staff and the staff's lack of project planning and implementation expertise.  More specific problems have included the peripheral nature of - and the lack of marketing forecasts in - income-generating projects and the diffusion of resources caused by the sheer number of rural outreach activities. The CVSS has taken considerable action to attain training targets. Training has covered a broad range of subjects for staff members, member agencies, and volunteers.  Although the training did not always achieve its desired end, due perhaps to the choice of topics, failure to motivate trainees, or the low educational level of trainees, this activity is highly commended. The grant has helped the CVSS begin to redress deficiencies in its operations and has provided an opportunity to develop technical capability within the CVSS and its member agencies.  To improve its operations further, the CVSS should improve inter-agency coordination, develop an appropriate structure arising from its needs, strengthen marketing and accounting inputs to ongoing projects, finance projects only after establishing a detailed financing position, provide appropriate planning and marketing staff, consider how to shift project emphasis from welfare to dealing with Jamaica's socioeconomic reality, and prepare operational plans for itself and its member agencies.  More specific recommendations regarding staffing, financing, fund-raising, regional offices, advice services, and development of a comprehensive training plan are provided. A 1-year project extension, as well as assistance that may be needed thereafter, is strongly recommended.","Attached to PD-AAL-907","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Social services|Private voluntary organizations","Jamaica","","","008563 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the institutional capacity of the Egyptian Ministry of Irrigation (MOI) and to develop improved irrigation and water management practices.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/76-11/80 and is based on document review; interviews with Government of Egypt (GOE), contractor, and USAID/E personnel; and site visits. Although progress has been constrained by inappropriate or delayed provision of technical assistance and equipment, excellent success has been achieved in some areas.  A multidisciplinary Egyptian water management study team, having received over 178 person-months of training, is conducting what is apparently the only on-farm research with good farmer cooperation in Egypt.  Relationships between the contractor and the Egyptian team have been excellent, although the Egyptians have questioned the contractor's extensive use of short-term advisors. In three pilot areas, Mansouriyah, Kafr-El-Sheikh, and Minya, the team has completed water budget studies which have provided valuable data on current constraints to on-farm water management.  Field trials in precision land leveling and long furrows were delayed but have now begun.  Initial crop management experiments, although important in building farmer confidence and producing remarkable yield increases, were irrelevant to project purposes per se; the focus of these experiments has now been modified. The project's major shortfall has been its failure to demonstrate yield increases strictly from changes in water management.  Due to the contractor's lack of a results-oriented attitude, planned canal trials have not begun, making it impossible for the project to fully achieve all outputs.  In addition, project findings have not been disseminated to Egyptian agencies. Pilot testing will now begin at three project sites to establish prototype irrigation delivery system technologies.  A detailed action program is outlined.  Recommendations are to continue the project and to expand its purposes to include labor savings, cost reductions, and water savings.","Attached to PD-AAI-560","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Water management|Irrigation|Agricultural research|Institution building","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAI560A.pdf","3,766 KB","008539 - USAID.

"Evaluates management of a multi-donor agricultural development project in Somalia's Bay Region.  Special evaluation covers a period ending 2/80; no methodology is noted. The project is in effect an integrated development project in which 8 Government of Somalia (GOS) entities are participating directly and 7 others indirectly.  The Project Management Unit (PMU), negotiated for the project by the World Bank, is a large and overdue step towards decentralization and interagency cooperation.  To institutionalize these concepts, the Interministerial Coordination Committee (ICC) should be strongly supported; a regional Technical Committee created; and the most qualified member of Somalia's regional staff be made Deputy Project Director.  Linkages with national institutions should not be neglected; as a case in point, USAID/S should urge an agreement between the Water Development Authority (WDA) and the Ministry of Agriculture which commits the WDA to send USAID/S rigs and personnel out of the region only after the WDA has completed drilling. To date, no provision has been made for popular participation; a crop and livestock advisory committee for all four project districts is urged.  Due to a shortage of trained Somali manpower, resident (not short-term) consultants should be employed and given intensive language training. Although GOS salaries are very low, donor allowances seem excessive and should be regulated by a GOS commission or at least by the ICC for this project. USAID/S should provide comparable allowances to GOS project personnel. To improve rural outreach, it is recommended that vehicles be provided in moderation; no service arrangements be made which would be negated by a partial cut in vehicles; and base-level veterinary and extension staff be housed in the villages. In light of supply shortages, it is urged that the PMU and national agencies (with help from the PMU accountant) authorize expenditures for supplies in good time; USAID/S use project funds to build a regional store of water pumps for the WDA; and spare vehicle parts be procured. Means suggested to provide a project contingency fund include increased World Bank commitment to the project or USAID/S use of P.L. 480 local currency funds.  USAID/S should allow the GOS Magistrate of Accounts to audit the project (subject to USAID/S review) only if the World Bank provides technical assistance. In fine, the project is managerially sound and should work well if problems with the WDA are solved.","Publication no.

"Evaluates project to increase revenue generation by local Philippine governments.  Special evaluation covers the period 1978-5/80 and is based upon interviews with project personnel, document review, and site visits. Although the project - which is behind schedule - suffers from an inappropriate design, overly optimistic objectives, and a lack of direction, it has made a strong positive contribution to its objectives and staff have shown initiative and drive in the face of serious and unexpected obstacles.  Tax mapping has been conducted by 147 local governments (which also have brought property records up to date) and begun by 143 others.  A tax mapping manual has been prepared, and a manual of improved collection procedures is being reviewed by the Ministry of Finance (MOF).  Through seminars and on-the-job training in tax mapping, recordkeeping, and collections, assessors' offices now possess the capability to tax map and maintain tax maps. However, many factors that were not anticipated during the design stage have dissuaded some local officials from participating in the project.  These include high start-up costs, the long waiting period before a province or municipality sees a tangible financial return, the fact that the seed money and other financial incentives alloted in the project are inadequate or accrue only after mapping is completed. Further, criteria for choosing participating municipalities are lacking in the project design, progress has been slowed by undue delays in commodity distribution, government and local officials seem to lack adequate information about the project, and the MOF views the project - which is implemented by the Ministry of Local Government and Community Development - as usurping some of its traditonal functions. By targeting fewer municipalities, providing larger incentives, and offering part of the sum in advance, the project might have more success.  In addition, onsite technical assistance would be cheaper and more effective than the present 3-day lecture and seminar training format.  Recommendations (particularly regarding institutional arrangements) are also made for Phase II, which could commence in 1983.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSAN-CA-0198","","10/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Tax collection|Real property taxes|Revenues|Local level|Tax assessments","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM123.pdf","9,581 KB","001103 - Syracuse University.

"Evaluates projects to provide integrated community health services (ICHS) and family planning-maternal/child health (FP/MCH) services, respectively, in Nepal.  Special evaluation covers the period 1973-79 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with Government of Nepal (GON) health personnel. The ICHS project has progressed slowly.  Plans to extend a functioning model of integrated basic health services to 675 new health posts (HP's) fell short - of 533 HP's established in 75 districts, 185 offer traditional curative services, 283 offer FP education and extension as well, and only 65 HP's in 23 districts offer fully integrated FP/health/malaria surveillance services.  Integration of services is only token, however, as FP/MCH services function independently of the ICHS program; malaria surveillance will not be fully integrated until 1985.  Integration difficulties are due mainly to resistance from other agencies, lack of strong GON direction, the low status of the ICHS project in the Ministry of Health, and insufficient project staff with poor management skills. Nonetheless, a system on which to build is now in place.  A total of 1,522 village health workers have been trained and make periodic home visits.  Among other HP personnel, 77 assistant nurse midwives, 34 auxiliary health workers, and 61 senior health workers received 3-6 weeks of training in 1978-79.  Training was not optimum, however, due to staff limitations and inadequate facilities.  The project has also suffered from poor reporting, supervision, and logistics; inadequate and delayed travel reimbursement; and, most seriously, severe shortages of medicines - only a 3-4 month supply is available per year. The FP/MCH project, on the other hand, has already substantially met its objectives.  As of 1978, the project supported 492 service sites in 62 districts with 1,748 staff.  Since then, 4 regional and 40 district offices, and 232 FP clinics (some in HP's) have been established, and 714 outreach workers have been trained to provide education, referrals, and contraceptives.  Vasectomies and laparoscopies are being provided - mostly at mobile facilities - to an increasing number of acceptors each year. FP/MCH sites also provide oral rehydration education and immunizations, and have provided effective FP education. Expansion of the ICHP and FP/MCH projects are planned for 1980-85. Eleven recommendations are made.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","3/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated health care|Health care|Health outreach services|Technical assistance","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAF676.pdf","2,906 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","000074 - USAID.

"Evaluates rural road component of a small farmer development project in Guatemala.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/79-8/80; no methodology is stated. Although work is a year behind schedule, the objectives of building a rural road network and establishing a permanent system for road maintenance have been achieved.  Delays were attributed to difficulties in attaining cooperation between the Ministries of Agriculture and of Communications and Public Works.  This resulted in retarded selection of road sites, program changes, delays in defining the project for Region IV, slow project authorization and financing, and delayed equipment acquisition. Road sites were selected on the basis of their possible contribution to agricultural productivity.  Of the originally targeted 280 km, eventually augmented to 293.5 km of 50 roads in four regions, work has been completed on 156.6 km. Supervisory functions of the four regions are located respectively in Chimaltenango, Jalapa, Chiantla, and San Miguel Uspantan.  Resident delegate directors of each region oversee local road work activities during site visits and supervise equipment availability, maintenance, and storage.  Control of project progress, equipment purchases and inventories, and labor recruitment and remunerations are systematically documented.  Wages are calculated based on time worked rather than tasks completed, provoking worker dissatisfaction. The project's labor-intensive strategy has been successful.  A monthly average of 1,428 local laborers, selected via promotion by social workers and resident project delegates, have devoted 60%, 25%, and 15% of their 500,000 total days worked to terracing, drainage, and resurfacing respectively. Based on the low-cost achievement of goals, it is recommended that national funding be continued.  To facilitate the rural roads program, it is also recommended that:  (1) a Department of Rural Roads be established in the Ministry of Communication and Public Works; (2) broader criteria for road site selection be developed; and (3) better systems for personnel, equipment, and financial management be designed.","Loan no. 520-T-026","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Roads|Rural areas|Labor intensive technology|Road construction","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAM076.pdf","1,038 KB","008550 - USAID.

"Evaluates project implemented by Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) to conduct research on and provide technical assistance (TA) to A.I.D.'s integrated rural development (IRD) projects.  Mid-term evaluation, conducted by Regional Bureaus, covers the period through 12/80 and is based in part on document review, interviews with project personnel, a field visit, and questionnaires to USAID's. Results have been mixed.  DAI's state-of-the-art paper (SOAP) on the organization and administration of IRD projects was well done, although too general to meet specific needs; the IRD design manual should remedy this defect.  While the core DAI team achieved a balance of expertise in research, it did so to a lesser extent in providing TA.  As a result, although DAI provided TA to the targeted 10 countries, the Technical Reports documenting the assistance paid inadequate attention to the management structure and the performance of IRD projects.  Awareness of sociocultural variants was also lacking, a defect also noticeable in the SOAP.  Further, site selection was based more on A.I.D. judgement of DAI's potential utility than on DAI's own research strategy or the needs of IRD projects.  Emphasis on the latter two factors would have enabled DAI, e.g., in Jamaica, to provide practical help in solving IRD project management problems. RAD (A.I.D.'s Office of Rural Development and Development Administration) farmed out to DAI its own responsibility to learn IRD project management and took only the usual steps document distribution and seminars - to disseminate research results.  The latter means are insufficient; one cannot learn of IRD project management by proxy nor are attempts to do so cost-effective.  The fault basically lies not with RAD, however, but with the structural separation of learning and doing throughout A.I.D. For the rest of the project, which should not be extended, TA should be more intensive and cumulative and innovative steps should be taken to disseminate research results.  In future TA/knowledge-building projects, RAD should be staffed with direct hires, its mandate expanded to include training and updating USAID personnel, and the latter work with contractors as part of their career development program.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSAN-C-0065","","12/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Development project design|Development project implementation|Information dissemination|Project change","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM290.pdf","18,176 KB","000079 - USAID.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE BAM IS TO PREPARE A COHERENT FIVE-YEAR (1978-82) PROGRAM OF STUDIES AND INVESTMENTS WHICH GOUV CAN PRESENT TO THE DONOR COMMUNITY FOR FUNDING. AID FUNDS WERE SPECIFICALLY AIMED AT STUDYING SOCIO-CULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS RELATED TO RESETTLEMENT PROGRAMS, AS WELL AS THEIR AGRICULTURAL CREDIT AND GRAIN MARKETING SYSTEMS, THE USE AND MAINTENANCE OF HEAVY EQUIPMENT, THE ORGANIZATION OF REPAIR FACILITIES, AND THE TRAINING OF AVV PERSONNEL. THE PROJECT'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN TERMS OF OUTPUTS, LESSONS LEARNED, ETC (OR THE LACK THEREOF) WERE NOT SPECIFICALLY EVALUATED DUE TO LACK OF COMPLETE PROJECT DOCUMENTATION AND OF FIRST HAND INTERVIEWS WITH KNOWLEDGEABLE SOURCES, AND THE PASSAGE OF THREE YEARS SINCE AID REPORTS WERE MADE PART OF THE ONGOING STUDY. THE PRESENT EVALUATOR'S BEST JUDGEMENT, BASED ON A FEW SHORT PARAGRAPHS IN THE BAM REPORT WHICH DREW UPON NARRATIVE PREPARED BY THE AID-FUNDED CONTRACTORS, IS THAT THESE CONTRACTORS MADE A MODERATELY USEFUL CONTRIBUTION IN THE PREPARATION OF THE BAM REPORT WHICH ITSELF HAS BEEN A USEFUL PLANNING DOCUMENT FOR THE AVV AND THE DONOR COMMUNITY. FOR REASONS NOT ASCERTAINABLE, SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY AID-FUNDED CONTRACTORS WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE BAM'S FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS. A TOTAL OF $106,237.16 WAS EXPENDED. THE UNLIQUIDATED BALANCE OF $3,762.84 IS TO BE DEOBLIGATED BY 6/30/80. STEPS SHOULD BE TAKEN TO VERIFY THAT ALL BILLS AND COMMITMENTS HAVE BEEN PAID. EVALUATION IS PREFACED BY A PES FACESHEET.","ATTACHED TO PD-AAG-685-B1","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Personnel management|Management training|Environmental research|Sociology research|Economic research|Agricultural product marketing|Cereal crops|Agricultural credit|Disease prevention and control|Population resettlement|ONCHOCERCIASIS|Demographic research|Regional development|Development planning|MIGRATION|Limited data","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG685C1.pdf","316 KB","000027 - USAID.

"EVALUATES THE HARMONISATION DE L'ACTION DES COMMUNAUTES HAITIENNES ORGANISEES (HACHO) PROJECT TO PROVIDE HUMANITARIAN AND SERVICE PROJECTS TO THE PEOPLE OF NORTHWEST HAITI. THIS END-OF-PROJECT EVALUATION COVERS THE PERIOD FROM HACHO'S INCEPTION IN 1966 TO 9/30/79, AND IS BASED ON A REVIEW OF DOCUMENTS, HACHO FILES, FIELD VISITS, AND INTERVIEWS BY A CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGIST AND A COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION SPECIALIST. HACHO'S RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER DONORS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WERE DESCRIBED AND EVALUATIONS WERE MADE OF SELECT HACHO PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICINE, NUTRITION, WATER PROJECTS, AND CRAFTS. THE EVALUATOR'S FOCUS, HOWEVER, WAS ON HACHO'S RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS, WITH WHICH HACHO HAS BEEN ACTIVELY ENGAGED AND THE BASIC STRUCTURES AND ACTIVITIES WERE ALSO DESCRIBED. LOCALISM WAS ALSO STRONG WITHIN THE COUNCILS AND RESIDENTS FAVORED LOCAL CONTROL AND DECENTRALIZATION, AS OPPOSED TO HACHO'S EMPHASIS ON MOLDING LARGER UNITS, COUNCILS AND SUBCOUNCILS, SUBCOMMITTEES AND REGIONAL FEDERATIONS. LOCAL RESIDENTS DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN HACHO AS AN AGENCY, THE COUNCILS AND THE FEDERATIONS. STRUCTURES BECOME BLURRED INTO LOCAL VERSUS OUTSIDE INTERESTS. NO HACHO POLICIES WERE PURSUED TO CLARIFY THIS PROBLEM. ALSO, PROJECTS WERE PREDOMINATELY INITIATED BY HACHO AND THEN ACCEPTED BY THE COUNCILS, UNLESS THE PROJECTS THREATENED THEIR VESTED INTERESTS. THUS, COUNCILS BECAME THE RECIPIENTS OF AGENCY SERVICES. LOCAL INITIATIVES WERE ONLY VISIBLE CONCERNING THE TYPE OF SERVICES TO BE RECEIVED. EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT LOCAL OFFICIALS FOUND IT EASIER TO SEEK FUNDS FOR CIVIL IMPROVEMENTS THROUGH HACHO AND THE COUNCILS RATHER THAN USING THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT, WHICH APPEARED UNWILLING TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT HACHO BE RECOGNIZED AS AN AUTONOMOUS REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCY OF THE HAITIAN GOVERNMENT AND THAT IT CONTINUES TO PROVIDE LOCAL SERVICES. HACHO SHOULD ENCOURAGE COMMUNITIES TO DEVELOP SELF-SUSTAINING ACTION PROGRAMS.

"EVALUATES PROJECT TO DEVELOP AN INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR MARINE RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT (ICMRD) AT THE UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND (URI) TO ASSIST LDC'S IN IMPROVING THE USE OF THEIR FISHERY RESOURCES. EVALUATION, CONDUCTED BY SPECIALISTS FROM AID/W AND THE US DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE MEETING WITH 18 URI STAFF MEMBERS, COVERS THE ENTIRE LIFE OF THE GRANT FROM ITS INCEPTION ON 1969 TO ITS TERMINATION ON 12/31/79. THE PROJECT WAS EXTENDED FOUR TIMES, FROM 5/74 TO 12/79, WITH $1,260,000 IN ADDITIONAL FUNDS. ADDED TO THE ORIGINAL PROJECT OBJECTIVES WERE THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF A FISHERIES INFORMATION SERVICE AND THE STRENGTHENING OF LINKAGES TO OTHER LDC FISHERIES DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTIONS. THE EVALUATION TEAM CONCLUDED THAT THE INFORMATION SYSTEM FULLY MEETS PROJECT DESIGN REQUIREMENTS. OVER 1,080 REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION WERE ANSWERED IN 1979 ALONE. THERE WAS CONCERN, HOWEVER, FOR THE FATE OF THE SYSTEM AFTER THE TERMINATION OF AID FUNDING, AS THE REGULAR CAMPUS LIBRARIES DO NOT HANDLE SUCH REQUESTS. PROJECT SHORTCOMINGS INCLUDED THE FACT THAT USAID'S DID NOT MAKE GOOD USE OF ICMRD; THAT THE LACK OF A COHERENT AND STABLE US FISHERIES/LAW OF THE SEA POLICY CAUSED MANY PROBLEMS; AND THAT AID'S ATTENTION TURNED TOWARD AQUACULTURE AND AWAY FROM ARTISANAL FISHERIES PROJECTS JUST AS ICMRD'S CAPABILITIES WERE BECOMING ESTABLISHED. THUS, ALTHOUGH SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN TERMS OF ASSEMBLING A QUALIFIED STAFF, TRAINING US AND FOREIGN PERSONNEL, GENERATING PROFESSIONAL PUBLICATIONS, AND PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO AID AND LDC'S, THERE IS A DANGER THAT, WITH THE PROJECT END, ICMRD WILL SHIFT ITS FOCUS AWAY FROM THE PROBLEMS OF POOR COUNTRIES AND TOWARD US DOMESTIC PROBLEMS. THE EVALUATION TEAM THEREFORE URGENTLY RECOMMENDED THAT AID CONSIDER MEANS OF CONTINUING SUPPORT TO ICMRD TO ENABLE IT TO KEEP ITS CORE FACULTY AND NECESSARY BACKUP SUPPORT. ALSO RECOMMENDED WERE THE INSTALLATION OF A PROFESSIONAL MANAGEMENT CAPABILITY IN AID/W TO INFORM USAID'S OF AID/W FISHERIES POLICY AND URI RESOURCES, AND AN AID/W REASSESSMENT OF ITS CENTRALLY-FUNDED UNIVERSITY SUPPORT PROGRAMS AND THEIR EVALUATION.","Evaluation period: 4 May 1969-31 Dec 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Universities and colleges|Educational facilities|Fishermen|Agricultural training|Fishing industry|Agricultural planning|Agricultural policy|FISH|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG196C1.pdf","595 KB","000854 - U.S. Dept. of Commerce.

"Evaluates project to develop an effective means of supplying young milkfish to commercial farmers in Southeast Asia.  This terminal evaluation is based on a two-day, onsite review at the Oceanic Institute (OI) at Waimanola, Hawaii. Both A.I.D. and OI expected that methods developed earlier by OI for mullet could be modified for use on milkfish. However, this expectation proved wrong.  The maturation and spawning of milkfish in captivity is much more difficult than mullet -- milkfish are easily distressed and their reproductive  physiology is more complicated.  As a result, a lack of brood animals proved to be an overwhelming obstacle.  For example, of 77 brood animals available in 1977, only six were found to be in proper reproductive condition for experimentation.  Spawning efforts in the Philippines might have been successful if more fish had been available -- and if a typhoon had not destroyed traps used to supply brood stock. However, OI researchers made progress in the use of hormone injections to induce spawning, and successfully identified the stage of ovarian development at which the oocytes are responsive to exogenous hormone treatment.  Also, later project experiments suggested that milkfish sperm can be stored for considerable periods and still be effective. Overall, OI's performance was satisfactory and its personnel well-qualified.  Technical and fiscal reports were submitted on time. Coordination with other institutions was extensive, and included contact with the Southeast Asia Fisheries Development Center (SEAFDEC), French Polynesia, and Taiwan.  Management problems included:  too many and too varied research activities, thus preventing sufficient attention to problem areas; misunderstandings with SEAFDEC personnel earlier in the project; and logistical bottlenecks -- a lack of vehicles, fuel, and tanks, and male fish ready for breeding.  This report is attached to a PES (PD-AAG-211-B1).","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Fish breeding|MILKFISH|Limited data","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG211C1.pdf","646 KB","000064 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to investigate the ecology and physiology of cattle ticks in order to develop environmentally sound and economically feasible controls for ticks and tick-borne diseases.  Evaluation covers the period 9/29/78 - 9/29/79 and is based on a Research and Advisory Committee special team's review of research results as presented by the contractor, the International Center for Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE) in Kenya. Significant progress has been made in both research areas. Well-designed studies are being carried out by highly competent ICIPE personnel in exemplary collaboration with other research institutes. First year accomplishments include development of an experimental skin test to identify and measure host cattle resistance to tick infestation and controlled studies to show that host animals develop resistance following prolonged exposure to ticks. Experimental physiological research results are not encouraging, however. Tests of ecdysteroids, precocene, and pheromones do not suggest that these chemicals are greatly able to disrupt the development and reproduction of ornithodoros porcinus, although ecdysteroids may be very effective against the East Coast Fever tick, rhipicephalus appendiculatus. Immunological studies, although not part of the present project, are considered integral to the total program by ICIPE.  Research to date has shown that exposure helps develop cattle resistance to ticks and that antibodies produced in mammalian hosts against tick antigens are ingested by feeding ticks. Future studies will attempt to combine these two approaches to render animals resistant to tick infestation as well as immune against target antigens for ticks.  ICIPE will submit a proposal for AID/W's participation in these studies.  In any case, it seems clear that future tick-borne disease control programs must include not only dipping of cattle with acaracides, but also the use of chemotherapeutic drugs and immunological techniques. ICIPE's technical and research training program continues at a high level, with 74 LDC researchers trained in the last year. Third-year funding is recommended.","Evaluation period: 29 Sep 1978-29 Sep 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Cattle|Livestock diseases|Livestock|Agricultural research|Pest control|Insects|Biology research|Disease prevention and control|Animal diseases|Ticks|Research facilities|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG227C1.pdf","774 KB","002992 - USAID.

"Evaluates project implemented by Harvard University (HU) to strengthen academic activities in patient care, teaching, and research at the University Center for Health Sciences (CUHS) of the the University of Yaounde, Cameroon.  Evaluation covers the period 11/29/73 to 12/31/79, and is based on HU team reports. In late 1974, a nurse/midwife and obstetrician joined the pediatrician and public health nurse on the HU team, augmenting its efforts in research and long-range planning.  The team assisted in training of medical personnel knowledgeable in medical problems endemic to Cameroon by developing clinical facilities and training in effective pre- and postnatal care, high-risk pregnancy and acute pediatric care. A major achievement of the team was the creation of a highly effective prenatal and Maternal Child Health clinic, which opened in 10/74 to provide both clinical and training facilities.  In 1975, a Child Spacing Clinic was established which provided a broad range of family planning services, and which reached, in its first year, over 1,000 patients.  A second very successful output was the establishment of a High-Risk Pregnancies (HRP) Clinic, another outpatient teaching facility.  As a result of the HRP Clinic's efforts, the prenatal mortality rate fell from 41.3 to 31.2 per 1,000. An acute problem faced by the team was the difficulty of implementing necessary preventive pediatric medical training because of the huge number of critically ill and malnourished children requiring care.  This project taught the need for increased emphasis in Cameroonian medical education on preventive medicine, especially for children under five. Other problems faced by the team were difficulties of communication, paucity of support personnel, inadequate facilities and overburdened professional staff.  Evaluation contains team members' recommendations in these areas. In the final phase of the program, a bilingual community nursing textbook was published and distributed, additional curriculum developed, and preparations made for the project team's 1979 withdrawal. Evaluation includes detailed description of activities by team members.","Evaluation period: 29 Nov 1973-31 Dec 1979","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Medical education|Curriculum|Health delivery|Health facilities|Publications|Health professional education|Maternal child health care|Clinics|Family planning clinics|Universities and colleges|Medical schools|Preventive medicine|Public health care|Nurses|Nurse midwives|Operations research","Central Africa|West Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG074A1.pdf","4,067 KB","001359 - Harvard University","","","English","application/pdf","Pre evaluation data|Evaluation team|Final EOPS|Onsite evaluation","","GUILLOZET, NOEL|CHAMBERLIN, ROBERT|et al.","","23 Apr 1980","","","","HARVARD - CUHS PROJECT","","PD-AAG-074-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc2OTQz","Sahel Regional","6250531"
"Evaluates project to increase crop production and marketing, especially of sorghum, in Botswana.  This special evaluation covers the period 8/1/76 to 2/29/80 and was based on a review of project files, site visits and interviews with project personnel. Progress in each of the project's three main components is as follows:  Institution of a Crop Division (CD) within the Government of Botswana (GOB) did not take place due in part to start-up delays. Accomplishment of this institution-building target now seems impossible. A GOB task-force prepared long-range development plans for crop production that did not include a CD.  It is recommended that this latter initiative be supported, and that USAID and the GOB develop a program for the Country Program Officer and a participant training program for the remainder of the project. The crop research component has been successful.  When screening trials showed that few of the crop varieties introduced had the yield potential or adaptability of local varieties, a breeding program was introduced to incorporate the desirable characteristics of introduced varieties into those locally produced.  Since the GOB lacks the skilled manpower to continue this program, funding from the USAID Agricultural Research Project for one or two breeders should be considered. Component to increase the warehouse storage space of the Botswana Agricultural Marketing Board (BAMB) is progressing slowly, but adequately.  Five 1,000 metric-ton grain warehouses have been built and are operating with reasonable efficiency.  Six more 1,000 metric-ton, strategically located warehouses will be completed by 9/80. Additional U.S. or third-country training in grain storage operations and agricultural technology is recommended for BAMB personnel. It also recommended that the GOB submit a reimbursement request (using Fixed Amount Reimbursement Procedures) for completed construction and periodic statements of local currency support; and that the final contribution date of the project be extended and $9,000 deobligated by amending Project Grant Agreement.

"Evaluates project to institutionalize a program of supervised production credit for small- and medium-sized farmers in northern Tunisia.  This special evaluation by a joint U.S./Tunisian team covers the period 10/78-5/80 and is based on a review of project documents, interviews, and field trips. The project has generally progressed well. Project administration was moved from the Direction of Vegitative Production (DPV) office to the ministerial Office for Assistance to Small and Medium Scale Farmers because the DPV was overburdened with other projects.  Project personnel have been recruited and trained, regional offices have been established, and equipment and materials have been acquired -- the project is now in place and ready to expand its services.  More than 1.2 million dinars have been approved in credit since the project's start and nearly 2,000 farmers in the target group were reached with technical services and credit during the past crop year.  Short-term loans are granted solely for field crops and vegetable production, while medium-term loans are for livestock and tractors.  More fertilizer is being used; production, especially of wheat, barley, and vetch, has increased; and fallow land has decreased. Problems include a shortage of vehicles for extension agents; a lack of coordinated planning at regional levels and below; a need for the National Bank of Tunisia to upgrade its services and for the project manager to receive senior staff support. The following actions are recommended:  (1) improvement in loan collection and reduction in delinquent accounts; (2) extension of the project for two years; (3) deductions from farmers' savings accounts to improve working capital as an alternative to increasing interest rates; (4) provision of funding for personnel recruitment and equipment; (5) strengthening of in-country training of extension agents; (6) extension of the small farmer credit system to other parts of Tunisia; (7) continued project evaluation by the National Center for Agricultural Studies; and (8) provision for anticipated shortfall of grant funds.

"Evaluates project to institute a program of supervised production credit in small- and medium-sized farms in Tunisia.  Evaluation covers the period 10/78-5/80 and is based on field studies by the National Center for Agricultural Studies. Project administration was moved from the Direction of Vegitative Production (DPV) office to the ministerial Office for Assistance to Small and Medium Scale Farmers (DAPME) because the DPV was overburdened with other projects.  This move noticeably improved managerial performance, but also delayed project implementation, as did the slowness of the National Bank of Tunisia (BNT) in informing its branches of responsibility in the project, processing loans, and reimbursing suppliers of commodities. Moreover, BNT reporting services have been incomplete, making loan monitoring difficult.  The project was also slowed by initially scarce supplies (especially fertilizer and D-5825 wheat seed), availability of machinery, and processing delays. Nevertheless, progress has been significant.  Nearly 1,000 loans, totalling over $500,000, have been made, with nearly two-thirds going to farmers holding 20 hectares or less and the rest to holders of 20-50 ha. Project area growers receiving at least one supervisory visit rose from 35% to 95% in 1978/79 and crop yields generally increased as the amount of land left fallow was reduced and the use of fertilizers, seed varieties, and herbicides and contact between farmers and credit extension agents rose markedly.  Forage production increased 41% and diversification patterns have improved.  The project's economic impact, however, while generally positive, has been uneven.  Farmer revenues increased in humid areas but decreased in arid areas due to climatic conditions.  The loan reimbursement rate has averaged 42% (and is now approaching 61%), with the best rate found among smaller farmers.  Many farmers expect to repay their loans gradually as money is received on the sale of other crops.  The recovery rate should improve further as weather conditions improve and project inputs increase.

"Evaluates project to establish the International Center for Living Aquatic Resources Management (ICLARM) as an important source of fisheries research and technology development in Southeast Asia and the Southwest Pacific.  This evaluation is based on an onsite review at ICLARM's Manila offices. ICLARM, originally headquartered in Honolulu, was established by a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation in 1975.  In response to a request for assistance, A.I.D. in turn requested that ICLARM broaden its geographic scope and establish its headquarters in a developing nation. ICLARM assumed a global charter, moved its headquarters to the Philippines, and reoriented its program to emphasize aquaculture and traditional (artisanal) fisheries.  In 1979, it received an $800,000 grant from A.I.D. Other donor funding was obtained shortly thereafter. ICLARM has achieved a number of breakthroughs in fish production.  In addition, it has demonstrated the viability of a cooperatively implemented research program rather than functioning strictly as a ""bricks and mortar"" institution. However, problems have occurred.  For example, at Central Luzon State University (where farming systems research with tilapia is being carried out), questions have arisen regarding how much of the University's fishery station can be used by ICLARM for long-term research. ICLARM's current activities fall into five major categories: aquaculture, traditional fisheries, resource development and management, marine affairs, and education and training. One of its strongest functions is its information service. An excellent reference library is being amassed, and a publications subsection is producing several series of studies and reviews. Evaluators recommend that A.I.D. allocate the final increment of its $800,000 three-year grant.  Other recommendations include the estabishment of a more comprehensive network of working relationships with research institutions worldwide and that every effort be made to refute the allegation that ICLARM is a US-dominated institutions.  This report is attached to a PES (PD-AAG-275-B1).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","FISH|Fisheries|Agricultural research|Fishery management|Institution building|Technical assistance|Limited data","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG275F1.pdf","1,788 KB","000064 - USAID.

"Evaluates project providing participant training to meet the critical need for technical and managerial manpower in Africa.  Evaluation covers the period 7/76-7/80 and is based on visits to four African countries, an examination of project records, and a review of the project paper (PP). This evaluation focuses on sub-Saharan Africa -- an area which ranks the lowest of any major world region in terms of training capacity and available manpower. The project was designed to offer a variety of training options:  U.S. training including the AFGRAD (African Graduate Fellowship) program, ""job selected"" academic training; short-term nonacademic training; training in Africa including INTERAFF II (academic training in third-country universities); non-degree, third-country training; and special, unscheduled training.  INTERAFF II was never implemented.  The PP presumed that the ratio of training in the United States as opposed to Africa would be on the order of 4 to 1 -- and was budgeted accordingly. However, because of the high cost of U.S. training in addition to other non-monetary reasons, the authors suggest that the PP be revised to redress this imbalance.  To date, 52 of the 249 AFGRAD II participants have completed their training.  To encourage more African-based training, A.I.D. should gather and disseminate information on available sources of training and develop working relationships with African organizations capable and willing to assist in placing trainees. U.S. academic training should be provided to candidates seeking M.S. degrees in programs not available in Africa and to those pursuing Ph.D.'s, particularly in scientific and technical fields.  A.I.D should continue to restrict training to development-related fields.  Other recommendations include tracking returning participants and evaluating their subsequent utilization and taking special steps to increase the number of women participants.

Evaluation covers the period 6/78-3/80 and is based on visits to PAID (Pan African Institute for Development) headquarters in Switzerland and to its regional offices in Africa. The project is being implemented by regional institutes in Douala and Buea, Cameroon; Ouagadougou, Upper Volta; Kabwe, Zambia; and the Central Program Support Service (SCAP) in Douala. The levels and quality of PAID personnel are satisfactory, with the professional staff now numbering 57. PAID's financial situation appears sound. Support from African governments and external sources is increasing. The outputs envisioned in the Project Paper (PP) have been generally achieved. From interviews, it appears that former trainees have done well in their careers. Some occupy senior positions in national and international development organizations such as the African Development Bank. PAID's record in assisting development agencies is impressive. Provision of substantive assistance to 40 institutions by 1982, called for in the PP, is on schedule -- during the first two years of the project assistance was given to more than 20 institutions. The authors outline 33 recommendations, with the following major actions called for: strengthening PAID's overall personnel management; charging fair market value for contract services; introducing long-term training at Ouagadougou; strengthening PAID's research and publication programs; improving internal evaluation; and instituting an effective follow-up program for former trainees. The authors also recommend that PAID consider recruiting staff with livestock and range management background for the Ouagadougou and Kabwe offices. In addition, PAID should consider the use of audiovisual equipment in its training programs and should consider installing telex facilities to improve interoffice communication and coordination. A.I.D. should continue this grant as planned and should consider some form of assistance after 1982.

"Evaluates project to support private voluntary organization (PVO) efforts to promote rural development in Ghana through farmer associations and rural business enterprises.  This special evaluation covers the period 9/77-5/80 and was based upon questionaires, onsite visits, and interviews with project personnel. PVO's have generally performed well, despite a lack of project guidelines.  USAID spent considerable time developing the latter.  Seven PVO's have conducted subprojects in 26 of Ghana's districts, directly benefitting 40,000 villagers.  Examples of subprojects are given below. Catholic Relief Services, operating in Tamala, has reached the initial stage of Farm Service Center construction and A.I.D. commodities are flowing into Ghana.  The Ghana Organization of Voluntary Assistance (GOVA) has formed 10 crop associations in Akobima.  In the Yensi Valley, the Ghana Rural Reconstruction Movement (GhRRM) has undertaken various subprojects such as introducing 348 small poultry farmers to various production methodologies. In Atebubu, the Association of People for Practical Life Education has begun forming numerous trade associations and has set up water projects in 10 villages.  In Ntonso, YMCA/Rural Enterprise Guidance Association's has established five craft and crop associations.  In Mankessim, Technoserve has provided technical and managerial assistance to two syrup factories.  The Christian Service Committee (CSC) in Tamala, is operating the old Farming Service Center and will build another center. Linkages with other A.I.D. projects were developed and two unanticipated results evolved:  Technoserve's assistance to other PVO's and the formation of a PVO consortium.  The team recommends that a second phase of the project should be implemented to allow for completion of phase one activities as well as new initiatives. Several suggestions for phase two modifications are given, including inviting all PVO's in Ghana into the program.  The team felt that the project deserved serious consideration for replication elsewhere.  (On the specific reasons for this, see PD-AAG-107-B1).","Evaluation period: 1 Sep 1977-31 May 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural production|Private voluntary organizations|Farmers|Poultry housing|Animal breeding|Poultry|Animal husbandry|Business enterprises|Rural development|AGRIBUSINESS|EMPLOYMENT|WATER SUPPLY|Agricultural inputs|Small farms|Indigenous education","Ghana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG107C1.pdf","3,365 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","DIMOND, FRANK|FUCHS-CARSCH, MARIAN","Agricultural enterprises and cooperatives","30 May 1980","","","","FARMERS ASSOCIATION & AGRIBUSINESS DEVELOPMENT","","PD-AAG-107-C1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MDMz","Ghana","6410072"
"Evaluates project to rehabilitate agricultural areas damaged in Lebanon's civil war.  Onsite evaluation, which is attached to a PES of 7/29/80 (PD-AAF-837-A1), covers the period 9/1/77-7/21/80 and is based on review of statistics and interviews with project staff and beneficiaries. The provision of low-interest loans to subsistence farmers who not only had property, farms, and homes destroyed, but who received little government assistance, answers a critical need in Lebanon.  Most loans were used to counter heavy damage in the South, where nearly 100% of the people earn all their income from farming, by providing agricultural inputs to small land-holders who had lost all self-confidence and incentive.  Nine community loans have also been made to dig wells, purchase communal tractors, and improve irrigation canals.  Save the Children (SCF), the implementing agency, insures effective use of loan funds by farmer training and other assistance. Loans have been made to 867 individuals and 9 villages; total beneficiaries are estimated to be 55,522. A women's component was begun in late 1979 which offered training in home economics, health, nutrition, and other topics to 15 women who are now community workers.  Loans for income-generating projects have been made to 71 women in 10 communities. Child health care centers and literacy classes that are still needed have not been funded; a broader range of projects for women should be considered for funding. Despite the security problem, most project objectives have been achieved:  income-generating potential has been increased; 19 community committees have been formed and 10 cooperatives strengthened; and the organizational structure has provided loans on a timely basis to the poorest individuals.  Almost 95% of the loans which have matured to date have been repaid.  Project funding and scope should be increased to meet the enormous needs which still exist, particularly in the south. Finally, SCF should incorporate the goals, objectives, and organizational structure of the project into a request for new funding, while shifting the focus from rehabilitation to development.","ATTACHED TO PDAAF837-A1|Evaluation period: 1 Sep 1977-21 Jul 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Community self help|Disaster relief|CIVIL WAR|Agricultural credit|Agricultural inputs|Agricultural production credit|Community development|Villages|Cooperatives|Nonformal education|Indigenous education|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Lebanon","","","001407 - Save the Children (U.S.)","","","English","","Country program evaluation|Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","FISCHER, JOHN L.|DAVIES, PHILIP E.","","21 Jul 1980","","GRANT AID/NE-G-1436","","AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION (SPECIAL EVALUATION OF 8/19/80)","","XD-AAF-837-1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MDUy","Lebanon","2680314"
"Evaluates project to facilitate the development of self-help cooperative enterprises in El Salvador.  Evaluation, prepared by Technoserve, Inc., covers the period 4/1/79-12/31/79.  No methodology was specified. Technoserve provided advisory services to 12 enterprises.  Five received technical and administrative assistance to initiate their programs, and one feed cooperative, COPIGAC, was able to assume complete management control of its activities.  Five other enterprises received assistance during their project proposal stages.  In addition, one cooperative received assistance during its study stage, while assistance to another cooperative, Corrales, S.A., was terminated due to its lack of financial commitment and disorganized membership.  In addition, Technoserve has conducted preliminary investigations on 13 other cooperative proposals.  Unfortunately, several promising groups and project ideas have been deferred because of Technoserve's heavy workload and limited financial resources. Specific activities have included assisting three cattle fattening feed lot projects and two feed concentrate plants.  Also, two cooperatives, ACADES (a wholesale grocery cooperative) and ACOPECC (a shirt making enterprise), reached a stage where they can manage their own activities and Technoserve assistance was therefore terminated. In regards to institutional relations, the Technoserve Promotion Committee has drafted legal by-laws for a National Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), which will assume Technoserve's role once the contractor departs.  The Ministry of Planning has agreed in principle to this plan.  Due to the changing political environment, further progress in this area has been delayed.  Administrative changes in Technoserve have included the appointment of an Salvadorean project director and two staff advisors. Projects assisted by Technoserve have increased the incomes, employment, investment, and productivity of the sponsored groups beyond initial expectations.","Evaluation period: 1 Apr 1979-31 Dec 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|CATTLE|Community self help|EMPLOYMENT|Cooperatives|Business enterprises|INVESTMENT|Feasibility studies|Private voluntary organizations|Management operations|Small scale enterprises|Agricultural cooperatives","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG312C1.pdf","3,937 KB","008540 - USAID.

"Evaluates the U.S. National Committee for the Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Project, which combines two environmental projects (Field Support, 9311028, and Training and Grants, 9311113) designed to upgrade the capability of A.I.D.'s Regional Bureaus and Missions in the area of environmental activity.  This special evaluation covers the period 9/77-6/80 and was based on onsite visits, interviews, and a review of project files. Under the combined projects, 18 subprojects have been implemented. To date, the main accomplishments have been as follows: Phase One environmental profiles were completed for 22 countries, with seven more underway, and a pilot Phase Two profile on Guatemala is near completion. A technical review of the profile process was conducted.  Several high-level policy conferences were held:  a U.S. Strategy Conference on Tropical Deforestation and a World Conference on Sea Turtle Conservation in Washington, D.C.; a Conference on Environmental Management and Economic Growth in the Smaller Caribbean Islands in Bardados; and an International Conference on the Social and Economic Consequences of Natural Resource Policies in Durango, Mexico. Two technical workshops were also conducted, one on watershed management training conducted in Los Banos, Philippines by the University of Arizona; the other on concepts and techniques for resource inventory and monitoring conducted by the University of Tennessee. The project suffered initially from the lack of a full-time manager. This problem, however, has been solved. It is recommended that the project be extended to 3/82 so that planned activities and an additional seminar can be carried out; that the RSSA with MAB be converted into a general agreement; that training services undertaken in the project be planned and evaluated (with DS/IT evaluation methods revised, and procedures instituted by workshop or seminar managers).  In addition, a summary program description should be drafted; other donor support should be explored; and regional bureau environmental officers should review their regional portfolios. Evaluation is attached to project PES (PD-AAG-226-B1).","Evaluation period: 1 Sep 1977-30 Jun 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Environmental research|Data collection|Data analysis|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG226C1.pdf","648 KB","000080 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to extend community based integrated rural development (CBIRD) programs administered by the Save the Children Foundation (SCF) in six developing nations.  Evaluation covers the period 5/1/75-12/31/78, consists of a contractor's ex post evaluation, and examines in detail CBIRD's impact in Honduras and Colombia. Using grant funds, SCF became a full-fledged development assistance foundation.  Both field and U.S. headquarter staff were trained in the CBIRD approach and SCF professional capabilities, especially in planning, evaluation, and reporting, were strengthened. In the project's 3 years, SCF received 13 operational program grants, mainly because of its increased capacity for self-evaluation and proposal writing. SCF applied the CBIRD approach in numerous social infrastructure, welfare, and productive enterprises projects.  It was found that the more innovative, straightforward, and necessary the project, the greater chance it had for vigorous community support. SCF provision of rational feedback to the participants generated community commitment and countered the feeling of powerlessness so prevalent among Latin America's poor. SCF is commended for regularly applying concepts of women in development and appropriate technology in the field.  The strong self-help component in projects to build schools, clinics, roads, and other infrastructure made these the most successful. Health, nutrition, and other social welfare service projects were less impressive since they were often understaffed and poorly planned. Finally, the programs did benefit the poor, but not the poorest -- women heads of households and the landless. Observations/suggestions include:  (1) truly innovative ideas, which have the greatest socioeconomic impact, are usually generated outside the community and are not ""felt needs;"" (2) the inclusion of planning, evaluation, and reporting activities can strengthen community participation in larger development projects; and (3) experimentation with innovative ideas should always be accompanied by thorough recording and evaluation.

"Evaluates project to develop the capacity of the Government of Lesotho (GOL) to implement and use agricultural sector analysis.  This special evaluation, which is attached to a PES (PD-AAG-091-B1), covers the period 9/1/76-2/1/80 and is based on interviews with project personnel. The project is progressing well, as follows:  (1) Training targets have generally been achieved.  Eight students will have completed B.S. or M.S. level U.S. training by 8/80, and 24 have attended formal in-country courses in agricultural production economics and applied statistics.  A tutorial program was offered for students scheduled for U.S. training (a highly commendable practice). On-the-job training, however, was very limited.  (2) The project team produced over 40 research papers on agricultural development in Lesotho, including work in all targeted areas (land and water conservation, manpower, livestock, marketing, and crop production and risk management); another 15 reports are near completion. Agricultural field studies were undertaken, existing data analyzed, and an agri-planning library established.  The Ministry of Agriculture's (MOA) planning unit was upgraded to a Divisional level and its staff increased by seven. (4) As planned, a long-term relationship has been established between MOA and Colorado State University. It is recommended that the agreement termination date be extended for one year and that additional USAID assistance be based on plans developed with the MOA and the Ministry of Finance.  Lessons learned included the following:  (1) A realistic plan for counterpart personnel is vital.  (2) Host governments must honor their commitments to contribute project personnel.  (3) USAID should document potential implementation differences between major project participants.  (4) Workplans agreed upon by all project participants should be developed for specific time periods and progress should be reviewed regularly. (5) Key terms should be precisely defined. (6) In projects with training programs, assignments for graduating trainees should be agreed on with host governments as a condition of scholarship acceptance.","Evaluation period: 1 Sep 1976-1 Feb 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Participants|Indigenous education|Reference libraries|Agriculture|Agricultural research|Universities and colleges|Agricultural economics|Economics education|Statistical analysis|Technical training|Agricultural development|Agricultural education|Sector evaluation","Lesotho","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG091C1.pdf","1,296 KB","008569 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop an effective economic and rural development management training program for district- and regional-level government officials in Ghana.  Evaluation, conducted by a team of six U.S. and Ghana officials, covers the period 9/77-2/80 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with project staff. Due to recruitment and commodity procurement delays, the project is a year behind schedule.  Nevertheless, the National Coordinating Committee (NCC) composed of five senior Government of Ghana (GOG) officials was established, but has been inactive and has failed to provide policy guidance.  A Project Secretariat (PS), including professional GOG staff, was also formed, but its lack of leadership has isolated field staff. Due to manpower shortages, only eight of nine planned three-man training teams were formed and trained. These teams have conducted seminars, attended by 1,998 district and regional staff, in 63 districts. The seminars have been so well received that uninvited departmental heads have requested invitations.  Quarterly field training seminars for the training teams have been held and curriculum and teaching materials are regularly reviewed.  Lack of local resources for the seminars has discouraged District Councillors (DC) from participating in the seminars.  Other problems include poor problem-solving techniques by field staff and resource and budget shortfalls due to Ghana's economic instability. It is recommended that NCC be reactivated and reconstituted; PS be adequately staffed to expedite field support; logistical support problems, especially regarding transportation, be reviewed; government policies be modified to increase local financial authority and alleviate resource shortages; GOG budget allocations be transferred to the recurrent budget to ensure timely arrival of commodities; ways be sought to apply training outputs more effectively to villages; seminars be extended to subordinate staff; and local resources be used in the seminars and methods be devised to integrate DC's in the seminars.

"Evaluates project to improve Guatemala's health care delivery system. This final evaluation's timeframe and methodology are not specified. Delays in project implementation, delivery of equipment, and submission of final vouchers necessitated three extensions of the terminal date for loan disbursement, totalling 27 months.  These delays were attributed to the 1976 earthquake and the Government of Guatemala's (GOG's) lengthy contract preparation and approval procedures. Utilizing construction contractors selected by the Ministry of Health, seven regional hospitals were renovated and an eighth is near completion in the Mazatenango, Tiquisate, Coatepeque, Zacapa, Chiquimula, Melchor de Mencos, Jutiapa, and Huehuetenango regions. In addition, a training center in Quirigua was renovated and expanded and construction of the Jutiapa Nursing School will be completed pending installation of windows and doors.  Half of the last major equipment procurement for rural hospitals, 100 health posts, the Training Center, and the Nursing School was obtained; the remaining equipment is being shipped and will be funded by GOG.  A health sector planning unit was staffed by eight technicians and the funding for their salaries was assumed by GOG in 12/79. Designs for radio communications networks were completed in four departments. Construction of the eighth hospital and the Jutiapa Nursing School remains to be completed.","AID LOAN 520-L-021","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Clinics|Health delivery|Hospitals|Health facilities|Building construction|Building renovation|Educational facilities|Health care planning|Health policy|Institution building|Telecommunications technology|Medical equipment|Limited data","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAF782E1.pdf","198 KB","008550 - USAID.

"Evaluates pilot project to educate key middle management business personnel in Egypt.  This special contracted evaluation, which is attached to PES (PD-AAG-322-B1), covers the period 10/78-2/80 and is based on document review and interviews with project and Egyptian business personnel and with trainees. Mainly because the terms of cooperation between the contractor, Southern Illinois University (SIU-C), and Egyptian counterpart institutions were not clearly defined at the project design stage, many key Egyptian institutions did not participate in the program.  As a result of this failure, which should be avoided in future projects, SIU-C's contract was modified and the program was basically carried out in the United States through academic training at the SIU-C campus and practical internship at U.S. businesses.  Key elements of the original program, in-country and country-specific education, never materialized. Ninety-six representative businessmen participated in the program, which focused on improving individual skills in the areas of U.S. political, economic, and business environment, and generally approved both it and SIU-C's performance. Suggestions for improvement include greater efforts to ensure that participating U.S. businesses parallel participants' home organizations; more emphasis on decisionmaking; reduction in classroom matter; and ensuring that all students are on the same level.  While the project benefitted individual participants, it had little impact on Egyptian management training institutions because of their non-participation. The project design, while correctly linking manager to environment, incorrectly assumed Egypt would soon possess a U.S.-type business environment; while in fact the public sector will likely remain dominant in Egyptian business for some time.  Thus the project provides no basis for a USAID/E long-term management development program.  It is recommended that such a program combine individual and organizational renewal within existing legal, sociopolitical, and institutional constraints and that host country institutions participate in project design and implementation.","Evaluation period: 1 Oct 1978-29 Feb 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/OTR-C-1773","","8/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Mid level managers|Management training|Institution building|Pilot projects|Business enterprises|Management|Problem solving|Beneficiary interviews|Public data|Project change","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG322C1.pdf","1,471 KB","000394 - Coopers and Lybrand Associates, Ltd.","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Final EOPS","","","","Aug 1980","","","","EVALUATION OF THE MIDDLE MANAGEMENT EDUCATION PROGRAM (MMEP) PILOT ACTIVITY (FINAL REPORT)","","PD-AAG-322-C1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MTI3","Egypt","2630042|2630090"
"Evaluates project to assist the Government of Cameroon's Mission for the Development of Food Crops (MIDEVIV) to implement a seed multiplication and distribution program to meet the needs of 250,000 farmers. This special evaluation covers the period 1/1/76-2/1/80 and is based on an onsite visit and a 3-day training seminar on seed technology. Major problems have included a lack of foundation seed, inadequate working conditions and excessive use of labor, adverse weather conditions, poor cultural techniques, and inadequate use of fertilizers and pesticides.  In addition, the inclusion of three broad components -- seed production, dissemination, and marketing -- proved to be a basic error in the project design.  Initially, the project was to be implemented over 5 years.  However, funds are exhausted, and A.I.D. has reduced the life of the project by 1 year.  The departure of U.S. personnel may lead to further problems.  For example, the weeding, harvesting, and processing equipment has not yet arrived, and the seed warehouses are still under construction.  This project should be considered an experiment which will set the foundation for Phase II of the project, establishment of a national seed service.  A plan of action should be outlined for the transition period, and the government should be kept informed of modifications to the initial agreement. Furthermore, the Government of Cameroon and donor agencies should make every effort not to lose momentum during that time.  Other recommendations include:  (1) scaling the project to available manpower resources and emphasizing personnel training; (2) restricting seed production to two state-operated farms; (3) increasing support to those farms rather than dispersing project resources; (4) establishing a realistic time frame for the project; (5) providing technical expertise to organizations receiving foundation seed; and (6) educating farmers on the benefits of good seed.  The authors emphasize that seed production at the small-farm level (a major activity during this evaluation period) should cease, and efforts should be redirected to information dissemination.","Companion project evaluation summary: PD-AAI-549-A1|Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1976-1 Feb 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSAN-CA-0148","","2/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Seeds|Distribution|Seed production|Agricultural storage facilities|SEED TESTING","Cameroon","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/GetDoc.axd?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MTMy&pID=NTYw&attchmnt=VHJ1ZQ==&uSesDM=False&rIdx=MjU1MDA=","","008524 - USAID.

This special evaluation, attached to PES, covers the period 8/31/77-10/31/80 and is based on onsite observations. Cotton, groundnuts, and soybeans have been found favorable for upland production; their use would also improve area water management. Another year is needed before the crop production and water management findings can be extended to farmers in the demonstration/training phase. Only the land preparation and leveling activities are on schedule, despite the fact that the project is 60% complete.  The structures and water measurement activity is 20% complete, demonstration/training is 10% complete, and water balance activities have not yet begun.  Personnel problems have been major: the Chemonics Inc. staff has performed only fairly, while the Government of Sri Lanka has assigned an insufficient number of trained, permanent staff to the project. Data analysis and critically important extension efforts have been most affected; more field researchers are needed to identify the most useful water management techniques and to collect additional information on the amount of rainfall and irrigation water which is being needlessly drained.  At least two permanent researchers must be added if the project, which is necessary now more than ever, is to benefit the greatest number of people. Recommendations are:  (1) the project should be extended for one year; (2) the manual ""Leveling Small Farms in Bench Terraces"" should be published immediately; (3) nine Sri Lankans should be hired as research assistants in irrigation/drainage methods, demonstration/training, water balance, and structures and measurement; (4) the project director should be given extra help in managing the project; (5) short-term expatriate advisors with backgrounds in hydrology, irrigation engineering, and extension should be hired if sufficient in-country advisors are not available; and (6) two persons with advanced U.S. training in on-farm water management should be provided.","Evaluation period: 31 Aug 1977-12 Nov 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Water conservation|Water management|Agricultural production|Appropriate technology|Rural areas|Delivery systems|Agricultural inputs|Cropping patterns|Agricultural research|Demonstration|Farms|Farmer training|Indigenous education|Participants|Graduate education|IRRIGATION|Irrigated farming|Project change","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG313A1.pdf","1,371 KB","001244 - U.S. Dept. of Agriculture","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation|Interim evaluation","","KEMPER, W.

"Evaluates project to develop a self-sustaining credit guaranty mechanism to nutralize the risk of commercial lending to small entreprenuers (SE) outside the bona fide credit system of Paraguay. This Special Evaluation, which is attached to a PES (PD-AAH-215-A1), covers the period 10/1/78-12/31/79 and was based on interviews, site visits, and a review of files. The growth of the Productive Credit Guaranty Project (PCGP) has surpassed expectations. In a portfolio of $9.9 million, 534 loans were executed.  The PCGP has generated credit to SE's and the partial guaranty and related incentives have attracted lenders.  The Central Bank of Paraguay (CBP), the in-country administrator, has initiated program operations and start-up activities, but has not fulfilled its obligations which include preparing accurate data relative to the borrower eligibility, drafting project feasibility studies, and technical assistance follow-up for borrowers.  The remaining three PCGP groups, i.e., A.I.D., lenders, and borrowers, are performing well. While evidence to date is not conclusive, the 75% guarantee level has reduced risk and stimulated lending, while also maintaining lender interest in loan quality. Program implementation should be completed as designed. Specifically, program monitoring and CBP control of lenders and technicians should be strengthened, particularly CB recertification and evaluation of technicians.  Also, CBP should prepare short- and long-term plans and conduct regular program assessments. Recordkeeping, reporting, and communication between participants should be improved.  A.I.D. should consider adopting a 3- or 4-component model if the technician and in-country administrator roles are not improved to support the monitoring and control functions.  If, however, Paraguayian participants cannot fulfill their responsibilities, A.I.D. should consider replacing the 5-component model with a 3- or 4-component model.  Other recommedations include focusing borrower eligibilty requirements on the target borrower groups and increasing the pace of delegation.","WORK ORDER NO. 1|Evaluation period: 1 Oct 1978-31 Dec 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-OTR-C-1774","","10/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","CREDIT|Financial institutions|Financial management|Management training|Banks|Small farms|Farmers|Small scale enterprises","Paraguay","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAH215B1.pdf","3,990 KB","000944 - Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Co.","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","","","1 Oct 1980","","","","PARAGUAYAN PRODUCTIVE CREDIT GUARANTY PROGRAM : OPERATIONS REVIEW","","PD-AAH-215-B1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MTQ5","Paraguay","5260114"
"Evaluates project to repair the electrical distribution systems destroyed by Hurricane David in the three Dominican Republic cities of Haina, San Cristobal, and Bani.  This final evaluation, which is attached to a PES of 10/28/80 (PD-AAH-370-D1), covers the period 11/20/79-9/22/80 and was based upon onsite inspections conducted by the contractor, the engineering firm of Charles Main. Except for minor details, the restoration work has been completed, and the objectives of the project have been achieved.  Upon Main's arrival in country 2/22/80, the Dominican Electricity Corporation (CDE) had already completed much of the restoration effort.  Although no AID-financed materials had yet arrived, the CDE had received bids on the list of AID-financed materials and was in the process of evaluating these bids.  CDE furnished supplier recommendations to A.I.D., which were approved after being removed by Main.  CDE then issued purchase orders to the suppliers.  The materials started arriving in the Dominican Republic in 6/80 and all of the deliveries are expected to be in the country by the end of the summer.  This will allow CDE to complete the restoration of the remaining items and replace materials which had been diverted from other projects.  A total of 20% of the poles, 90% of the conductors and 50% of the transformers in Bani and 80% in San Cristobal were restored. Restoration in Haina is assumed to be similar to Bani.  The material cost of restoring power to each city was estimated by Main to be approximately $250,000.  Main estimated that 98% of the restoration had been completed as of 5/80 and that about 20% of the work would have to be upgraded or redone. The use of an accounting system organized into small geographical areas which would record the material and labor changes in each area is recommended as a future monitoring device.  The ""quality"" aspect could be monitored through an individual crew foreman with separate field monitoring by an independent engineering firm, although this requires a fairly extensive and time-consuming effort.","Evaluation period: 20 Nov 1979-22 Sep 1980","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Disaster relief|Electric power distribution|ELECTRIFICATION|Electrical system maintenance","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAH370E1.pdf","519 KB","000315 - Charles T.

"Evaluates project to promote the participation of Costa Rican women in socioeconomic development programs.  This special contracted evaluation (attached to PES, PD-AAF-923-E1) covers the period 1/79-2/80 and is based on a review of previous evaluations and interviews with project personnel and participants. The project is being implemented by the Overseas Education Fund of the League of Women Voters in conjunction with the Federation of Voluntary Organizations (FOV), a local PVO.  USAID financing expired 11/79, and the project staff has been reduced to a bare minimum. Several local government agencies have refused funding, citing government cutbacks and a deteriorating economy.  The evaluators strongly recommend further A.I.D. funding of the project -- which has been very successful in motivating and improving the self-image of poor women.  For example, 7 of 15 participants reported a decline in physical agression from their husbands. They attributed that decline to their own renewed sense of self-respect. While many husbands resisted the program initially, their attitudes changed. A significant cause of this change was the increase in income due to the wives' improved job attitudes. Publicizing the program came too little and too late--in part due to the difficulty of hiring public relations personnel at the offered salary level.  Publication of more news bulletins is recommended. Existing public relations posts should be maintained, and special funds should be allocated to establish a publicity program involving local university students.  An indepth study should be conducted to determine the degree and content of the change in attitude among women participants. Other recommendations include further elaboration of the motivation-adaptation method of training and establishment of an advisory committee composed of representatives from public and private agencies with development programs for women. The project staff performed well.  An unplanned effect was the therapeutic value of the group sessions for the participants.  The project was a lesson in human relations within a subculture of poverty.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1979-28 Feb1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Indigenous education|Private voluntary organizations|Women in development|Education|Associations|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG366A1.pdf","688 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Pre evaluation data|Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Final EOPS|Onsite evaluation|Social science evaluation","","HILDALGO, JORGE G.|BONILLA, CARLOS|et al.","","16 Jun 1980","","OPG 515-0140","","OEF/FOV HUMAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT","","PD-AAG-366-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MTU0","Costa Rica","5150140"
"Evaluates project to separately fund small constructive activities. This special evaluation, prepared by Fundacion Campaneros de las Americas and attached to a PES (PD-AAH-204-A1), covers the period 9/1/79-9/30/80 and is based on onsite interviews with subproject directors. The 18 subprojects, which range from rabbit production to forestry to schools and small businesses, are evaluated according to the following criteria:  rate of completion; type of administration; type of group involved; location; level of community investment; group involvement in funds management and project planning; experience in previous projects; level and time span of income generation; appropriateness of technology; and return on investment.  Of these 11 factors, six were prime determinants of success and five were relatively unimportant.  Community involvement was found to be critically important; the greater its extent, the higher the chance of subproject success.  Type of administration was the most influential factor: only one of the six activities which were less than 20% complete had a community-based administrative mode, but all eight of the activities which were over 80% complete had a community-based administration.  The most successful community administrators were found to be Peace Corps volunteers, while absentee administrators were least successful.  Also, cooperatives and associations, especially those with a purpose parallel to the activity, had a higher completion rate.  Other guarantors of success are community cash and in-kind investment; community involvement in funds management and project planning; and short-term income generation activities. The evaluators recommend that the program be continued and expanded. Stricter limits should be imposed on the spending of project funds. Finally, an onsite screening interview with potential administrators should be conducted to promote the implementation methods most likely to succeed.","Evaluation period: 1 Sep 1979-30 Sep 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Small scale enterprises|Cooperatives|Financing|Community development|Community participation|Agricultural production|FORESTRY|Animal husbandry|Livestock|Cottage industries|Beneficiary interviews","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAH204B1.pdf","2,842 KB","002119 - Partners of the Americas","","","English","application/pdf","Peace Corps|Country program evaluation|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","STRONG, NED D.","","31 Oct 1980","","","","EVALUATION OF THE SPECIAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY AUTHORITY FOR FY 1979","","PD-AAH-204-B1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MTU1","Ecuador","5180004"
"Evaluates project to establish the Volta Valley Development Authority (AVV) to develop the underpopulated areas under its control in Upper Volta. Evaluation, timeframe for which is not specified, is based on interviews with project staff, site visits, and review of documents. AVV's farm model and technical package are inflexible and do not address all farmers' needs.  The fertilizer used is inadequate; it is geared to cotton, but not to cereal crops.  The method of applying fertilizer (after, instead of, during planting) is useless.  Soil erosion and runoff are rampant due to plowing with heavy machinery, monocropping with cotton using clear-cut furrows (versus intercropping with legumes), burning fields after harvest, and a 2-year fallow period. Pesticides are used indiscriminately without testing for need and optimum timing of application.  Plow animals are poorly trained and unhealthy. An extension service was established and is functioning in most of the settled areas but lacks leadership, training equipment and facilities, transportation, and trained personnel at all levels. Two AVV research stations (RS) were set up to study agronomy and animal production. Both RS's staff are competent and their experiments well-designed and executed.  Further experiments are being conducted at the Kamboinse Agricultural RS under the management of International Crops Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT).  However, AVV cannot absorb the data generated by the RS. Recommendations include:  (1) limiting the use of heavy equipment; (2) using crop-specific fertilizers; (3) using early and late maturing crops and inter- and double-cropping; (4) improving the health and training of plow animals; (5) recruiting extension agents (EA) from villages based on farming experience and extending training for all EA's to a year; (6) obtaining data on Malawi's extension service; (7) obtaining additional trainees, equipment, and facilities; and (8) applying the research findings from the AVV and ICRISAT RS at the village level.  Finally, AVV should work more closely with other government agencies and adopt a more flexible policy on migrants.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/SOD/PDC-C-0230","","3/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Laboratories|Agricultural research|Agricultural extension|Agricultural extension training|Appropriate technology|Indigenous education|Rural development|Fertilizers|PESTICIDES|ANIMAL HEALTH|MIGRATION|Cropping patterns|Small farms|Farmers|Institution building|Crop diversification|Agricultural equipment|Agricultural technology|Beneficiary interviews","Burkina Faso","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP040.pdf","614 KB","000883 - A.L.

"Evaluates project to improve the capability of Liberia's John F. Kennedy National Medical Center (NMC) to serve as the key institution in the nation's health care delivery system.  This special evaluation, focusing on NMC's impact, covers the life of the project, 1963-1979, and is based on interviews and a review of files. USAID assistance was provided to three of NMC's four components -- the JFK Memorial Hospital, the Maternity Hospital, and the Tubman National Institute of Medical Arts (NIMA). Over the years, NMC has grown into a modern medical center and teaching complex providing services, personnel, and supplies to the entire health care delivery system.  The JFK Hospital has a daily in-patient load of over 300 and an outpatient load of 450.  Since it is used as a last resort, mostly by malnourished children, it has a high death rate (20%).  In 1979, the Maternity Hospital served over 20,000 and 56,000 in- and out-patients, respectively; while NIMA enrolled 285 students and graduated 93 certified technicians and service personnel.  NMC patients are a cross-section of society.  Children under five and the poor are admitted free.  Through payroll, purchases, and development expenditures together totalling over $10 million, NMC has also had a positive economic impact. NMC drawbacks include overcrowding due to free care; overuse by the wealthy; high operational costs (over 40% of the national budget); and low wages which compel staff to hold two jobs and cause absenteeism and long patient waiting periods.  NMC is also viewed as a U.S. transplant, especially because the level of technology is difficult for Liberians to absorb and causes operational and maintenance problems. Lessons learned include the inadequacy of prior consultation with Liberian counterparts and of follow-up of U.S.-trained participants; the need to screen contractors to identify potential conflicts; the preferability (in hindsight) of a smaller, less costly institution; and the success of the institution building goal because A.I.D. stayed with the project to its completion. Overall, NMC has had a quite positive impact on health care in Liberia.","Loan no. 669-H-004A/B|Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1963-31 Dec 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Clinics|Health outreach services|Health delivery|Health facilities|Medical education|Indigenous education|Participants|Technology transfer|Institution building|Rural areas|Health care|Beneficiary interviews","Liberia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG343B1.pdf","2,449 KB","001629 - Cokasco, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Final EOPS|Impact evaluation","","","","1 Mar 1980","","LIS-I-80","","IMPACT STUDY; JOHN F.

"Evaluates project to reconstruct the principal 69 kv transmission line which was damaged by Hurricane David in the three Dominican Republic cities of San Cristobal, Valdesia, and Bani.  This final evaluation, which is attached to a PES (PD-AAH-371-A1), covers the period 11/20/79-7/4/80 and was conducted by the contractor, the engineering firm of Charles T. Main. The project was completed in six months.  Minor delays in material deliveries caused short recesses in the construction effort. Had these delivery problems not occurred, the project would have been completed in shorter time with some labor cost savings. Construction began in early 12/79 with materials which were available in the inventories of both the Dominican Republic Electric Corporation (CDE) and the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA).  During construction, Main observed the anchor installation, structure erection, hardware installation, and the wire stringing and made recommendations to PREPA, who then made improvements accordingly.  In the mountainous regions a helicopter was used to transport and erect the structures and to string the wire.  All of the conductor was installed manually.  During the initial stages of construction, Main noted that grounding was not done on some structures. This grounding was later completed and no deficiencies exist at this time. PREPA's accounting system was found to be excellent for establishing a basis for the invoicing. Invoices, which represent everything except for the accounting adjustments of the PREPA contract, have been approved for approximately $100,000 less then the original PREPA budget. PREPA was supported reasonably well by the CDE in the areas of excavating holes, surveying, and in other areas of line construction. It may be more efficient to have these smaller items totally under PREPA's control.  Main feels the effort of all parties contributed to the successful completion of the project.","Evaluation period: 20 Nov 1979-4 Jul 1980","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Disaster relief|Electric power distribution|ELECTRIFICATION|Electrical system maintenance","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAH371B1.pdf","2,307 KB","000315 - Charles T.

"Evaluates project to support the Partners of the Americas (PA) program to develop partnerships between U.S. and Latin American (LA) cities or states. Evaluation covers the period 1/75-6/80 and is based on interviews with partnership personnel. Citing examples from 11 representative partnerships, the evaluation examines the PA's national association (NAPA) and its support for the program's 50 partnerships in such areas as agriculture, rehabilitation, community education, health, sports, and journalism. The partnerships are very effective in promoting A.I.D.'s development aims and fostering people-to-people relationships. However, the partnerships need strengthening in terms of funding, membership, public recognition (even in partnership communities), and geographic scope. The planned expansion of community education activities needs to be clearly defined.  Successful rehabilitation projects, especially those providing appropriate technology, should be strengthened. NAPA is praised for its high quality staff and efficient accounting system.  However, NAPA makes little systematic effort to record and disseminate experiences among the partnerships, and there is insufficient follow-up of grant objectives. Despite efforts to locate outside funding, NAPA still depends on yearly A.I.D. grants, which should remain a routine part of A.I.D.'s annual budget. The major recommendations for partnerships are to increase membership through selective recruitment rather than general campaigns; to create an executive directorship for each partnership; and to organize LA partnerships into national and regional federations.  NAPA should improve and expand its member services in fund-raising, project design, and training and should promote institutional linkages.  NAPA should also build an information bank of case studies and increase publicity of its successful development projects.  Increased LA participation is needed in the PA Boards and NAPA's executive committee. Finally, partnerships should establish substantive indicators of performance, timing, and responsibilities and should use the mini-grant concept wherever possible.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1975-31 Oct1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAC/PD-C-1396","","11/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Community development|Private voluntary organizations|Education|Rural areas|Disadvantaged groups|Disabilities|Vocational training|Agricultural development|Development strategies|Health outreach services|Technical assistance","Latin America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG338C1.pdf","2,933 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Pre evaluation data|Multi country evaluation|Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","STEDMAN, WILLIAM P., JR.","","1 Nov 1980","","","","EVALUATION OF THE PARTNERS OF THE AMERICAS","","PD-AAG-338-C1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MTcw","Latin American Regional","5980436"
"Evaluates project to implement an integrated rural development program in Upper Lofa County, Liberia.  This special impact evaluation covers the period 1/77-5/80 and is based on project documents and interviews with beneficiaries. Project activities have generally been successful, and the project has had a positive impact on rural development in the area.  The production of surplus cash crops has increased farmer income, but has at the same time put inflationary pressures on the economy.  The project's most successful element has been the rapid adoption of swamp rice production; with the introduction of better seeds and cultivation methods, production is now at 258% of target and non-project farmers are clamoring for inclusion. Upland rice has not reached its targets, both because of the high response to swampland rice and the difficulty of obtaining and distributing seeds to farmers.  Although rehabilitation of existing trees was abandoned because it was impractical, coffee and cocoa production is generally on target.  The first new coffee crop will be harvested in 1980. The Liberian feeder road construction program has fallen far behind schedule.  Even with construction help from A.I.D.'s road maintenance group, only 100 new miles of feeder roads have been built, far less than needed to meet farmer needs for accessibility to swamp and cocoa cultivation areas and for marketing surplus crops. Well-digging efforts have been a success, however, already equalling the final target of 100, and the schistosomiasis surveillance unit has kept snail infestation under control.  The project has had a positive social impact, especially through farmer training by extension agents and the town cooperative units, which now number 200.  Problem areas include the insufficient input of small farmers into cooperative management and the cooperatives' difficulties in delivering inputs and managing loans.  Finally, the project has helped boost host government agricultural development efforts elsewhere in the country and has strengthened the government policy promoting diversification into cash crop and food production.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1977-31 May1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Road construction|Farmer training|Agricultural extension|WELLS|Integrated rural development|Agricultural cooperatives|Agricultural inputs|Agricultural diversification|Access roads|RICE|Agricultural credit|Agricultural extension training|Cooperatives|Management operations|Cocoa|COFFEE|Appropriate technology|Rural areas|Beneficiary interviews","Liberia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG345A1.pdf","2,151 KB","008570 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to carry out farming systems research in Southern Mali. Evaluation covers the period 1/1/78-12/17/80 and is based on an onsite review. USAID's financial contribution is relatively small.  Other donors include Canada and the Ford Foundation.  The project was designed to consist of four components:  (1) a study of the existing farm system and identification of constraints; (2) development of technological solutions; (3) testing of the new techniques; and (4) extension of the techniques to area farmers.  However, the first 2 years of the project have been devoted solely to information gathering -- constraints analysis still remains to be done.  In addition, the case-study methodology chosen by project personnel to carry out their research proved far more difficult than anticipated.  Farmers were selected from three villages (Sakoro, Gladie, and Monzondougou), reflecting different levels of development.  However, cotton production rather than agricultural technology proved to be the determinant of development in the villages.  A further problem was that the case-study methodology presupposes an intimate knowledge of the villages by the researchers -- which is not the case in this project.  The researchers live in Sikasso and, given the distances involved, can visit the villages only once every couple of weeks.  While the project research team is dedicated and well qualified, it is also young and inexperienced.  Nevertheless, on-the-job training of the team should be considered a valuable output. Corn production trials have been suggested for the 1980 season.  A strong local preference for millet and sorghum in addition to milling difficulties are major drawbacks.  The Tierouala research station has played -- and is expected to continue to play -- a marginal role in the project. The project management proved highly competent--excercising initiative in adjusting the methodology prescribed in the project paper to suit local conditions.  Use of the case-study and farm-typology research approaches should be reconsidered in light of the problems experienced.  Replication of the project should be postponed.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1978-17 Dec 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","625-0929A-S-00-8001","","12/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural production|Agricultural technology|Farms|Agricultural surveys|Cropping patterns|Institution building|Laboratories|Farming systems research|Delivery systems|Agricultural inputs|Farming systems","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG078B1.pdf","10,637 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","ARIZA-NINO, EDGAR J.","Farming systems","17 Dec 1980","","","","MALI - SUD FARMING SYSTEMS RESEARCH PROJECT - AN EVALUATION REPORT","","PD-AAG-078-B1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MTg1","Sahel Regional","6250928"
"Evaluates project to train local health workers and to establish a regionalized health information and delivery system in the Eastern Coastal areas of Nicaragua.  This contracted final evaluation, which is attached to a PES Facesheet (PD-AAG-335-B1), covers the period 1976-3/80 and is based on interviews, site visits, and a review of project files. Although two conferences were held on the subject, the planned regional health council was never institutionalized. Nevertheless, 34 villages were loosely integrated into a health system and six of these communities have established health posts.  In addition, 191 village health workers (VHW) -- 44 health care leaders, 51 nutritionists, and 96 midwives -- have been trained and receive periodical retraining from the Center for Regional Development (CENDER).  The bulk of VHW time is spent on curative medicine. Regarding the project's secondary objectives, the planned regional training center facility was not established, nor were training manuals developed.  This has impeded the formal reporting of project-related data to other agencies.  Moreover, since the Ministry of Health's logistical system has proven unsatisfactory, the Wisconsin Nicaraguan Partners has been distributing the medications by default. A referral system was established in Zelaya, but it is poorly operated due to inadequate transportation and communication.  Also, two clinics have set up radio programs to promote health care, yet due to power interruptions, etc., their impact is limited. Recommendations include the following:  While the program should definitely not be expanded, it should receive additional support.  VHW training can be improved by formalizing the curriculum and developing a teaching manual for each worker; by emphasizing preventive care, e.g., immunization, and community health education in such areas as sanitary practices; and by inculcating a team approach. Finally, a list of essential drugs and algorithms explaining appropriate dosages should be developed. A price range for each drug should be posted and VHW's encouraged to follow-up on patients to whom the drugs are given.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1976-31 Mar1980","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Indigenous education|Medical education|Curriculum|Health education|Primary health care|MASS MEDIA|Health delivery|Logistics|Clinics|Building construction|Information and referral services|Community health workers|Rural areas|Training centers|Educational materials|Manuals and handbooks|Private voluntary organizations|Beneficiary interviews","Nicaragua","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG335C1.pdf","2,547 KB","008584 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to support the work of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) to promote rural development.  This special contracted evaluation, attached to a PES of 1/81 (PD-AAG-346-B1), covers the period 6/76-7/79 and included interviews with ECA personnel. The major finding is that ECA's great collaborative potential is being underutilized because of the low level of funding and the poor design/implementation of ECA projects. Although several projects have been successful (seven are recommended, with certain revisions, for continued funding), the impact of A.I.D. support on ECA programming and priorities has been minimal.  Implementation of ECA projects has been hampered by ECA's difficulty in recruiting qualified staff due to its slow and complex hiring policies and its location in troubled Ethiopia. ECA also lacks sufficient support and administrative services. Most ECA projects lack proper focus and utilize resources poorly. Project assumptions are often untested and no criteria exist for measuring achievement of outputs.  To correct these design problems, A.I.D. personnel should be brought into the conceptualization and planning phases, and ECA should be granted direct access to A.I.D. decisionmakers.  Most importantly, project impact has been damaged by the proliferation of proposals and donors, each with its own priorities and requirements.  The resultant series of projects are unrelated and lacking in intra-agency cooperation. The ECA secretariat can provide only limited, ineffective leadership over this wide-ranging project area. Future funding must be highly structured, with individual donors concentrating upon selected areas to avoid multi-donor concentration in some areas and neglect in others. It is recommended that A.I.D./ECA design a regional development project prototype, limiting support to one development concept.  A.I.D. should assist at the conceptual, planning, implementation, and evaluation phases, and should specify mechanisms for collaboration among ECA divisions.  The project should follow the Lagos Plan for cooperative economic and agricultural development.","Evaluation period: 1 Jun 1976-31 Jul 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/afr-C-1654","","7/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Agricultural development|Development strategies|Development project design|Development project implementation|Development project evaluation|Institution building|Appropriate technology|Rural areas|Technology transfer|Women in development|Alternative energy resources|Economic policy|Economic planning|Needs assessments","Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG346C1.pdf","15,130 KB","002104 - One America, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation|Impact evaluation","","","","1 Jul 1980","","","","ECONOMIC COMMISSION FOR AFRICA; EVALUATION AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT OF 1976-1979 GRANTS AGREEMENTS","","PD-AAG-346-C1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MTkz","Africa Regional","6980340"
"Evaluates project to enhance the ability of A.I.D. Missions and LDC institutions to develop and implement rural development programs. This special AID/W evaluation, attached to a PES (PD-AAG-351-B1), covers the period 9/77-9/80; methodology is unspecified. A change in project management and a refocusing of priorities delayed project implementation during the first year. Activities during the period included 121 days of consulting services provided to Missions; plans made for an applied research program in Haiti; two strategies papers drafted; and a list of specialists made and distributed.  Three planned conferences on applied research did not materialize, but a workshop on alternative approaches to extension did take place. During the next 18 months, the project gained momentum. Consulting services, increasingly in demand, were provided to six Missions, primarily in developing background and project papers. Applied research on small farmer agricultural production and marketing systems (farming systems research -- FSR) was initiated in Thailand and Cameroon.  Nine papers were published and the state-of-the-art paper (SOAP) was begun. The project received additional funding in 1980 in response to increased USAID demand for project services. The SOAP on FSR was published and followed by two seminars.  Four other papers are being prepared, and additional seminars are planned on the SOAP, field work in FSR, and modern data collection methods. Evaluators conclude that the project is achieving its purpose, especially through providing consultant services and diffusing knowledge on alternate rural development strategies.  The project should be extended for 30 months and analytic work should continue on the cost-effectiveness of alternative data collection methods; institutionalization issues; integration of cropping and livestock production; consumption effects of alternative production; and the relationship of production/consumption to policies and infrastructure. Other recommendations are that the level of professional and student effort be maintained and that information dissemination receive greater emphasis.","Evaluation period: 1 Sep 1977-30 Sep 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Information dissemination|Rural development|Development project design|Development project implementation|Development project evaluation|Small farms|Farmers|Data collection|Data analysis|Cropping patterns|Animal husbandry|Livestock|Agricultural research|Agricultural development|Development strategies|Agricultural production|Agricultural product marketing|Development planning|Technological development|Farming systems research|Technical assistance|Project change","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG351C1.pdf","753 KB","000079 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the capability of Guyana's Ministry of Works and Transport (MWT) to improve the national road system. This special evaluation prepared by USAID's chief engineer covers the period 12/1/79-12/31/80 and is attached to a PES facesheet and another special evaluation (PD-AAG-328-B1, F1). No methodology is given. The imminent restructuring of MWT will further delay project progress.  If USAID and the host government disagree on new conditions for the project, USAID should consider ending one or more project components. Despite USAID urging and the readiness of design and contract documents, the construction of two feeder roads has not yet begun.  Due to the low priority of this component for MWT, and the ability of project funds to finance construction of only 10 of 25 planned miles of road, USAID should deobligate the funds and not extend the time to meet conditions precedent.  Construction of the highway laboratory is 5 months late.  The laboratory may be hard to staff and, because a local university has a similar laboratory, it may not be needed. Due to MWT's inaction, USAID should consider ending funding for this activity.  MWT has not decided how to improve the rebuilding, district, and central workshops.  Given the construction materials shortage, completion of any improvements prior to the project's end is unlikely.  Equipment repair has been continually delayed.  USAID should disallow additional equipment purchases and fund improvements only if they can be finished in time.  The performance of Tippetts-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton (TAMS), the contractor, has suffered due to the above problems, MWT's poor project management, and its own personnel changes and staffing problems.  The project's likely redesign and reduced inputs will render at least one team position obsolete, requiring a contract renegotiation.  Training conducted by TAMS has had no major long-term impact on local institutions, has used inadequate materials and facilities, and may not have been extended appropriately. Any redesign of the project should consider improving training program's effectiveness.","Loan no. 504-T-013|Evaluation period: 1 Jan1979-31 Dec1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Management training|Administrative occupations|Soil scientists|Technical training|Vocational training|Mechanical technology|Technicians|Laboratory equipment|Science education|School laboratories|Educational materials|On the job training|Indigenous education|Access roads|Road construction|Roads|Transportation system design|Institution building|Transportation education|Transportation planning|Project change","Guyana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG328C1.pdf","1,063 KB","008553 - USAID.

"Evaluates training component of project to upgrade the institutional capability of Guyana's Ministry of Works and Transport (MWT). This special contracted evaluation covers the period 1/1/79-10/1/80 and is based on a review of project documents, project personnel interviews, and site visits. This evaluation is attached to a PES facesheet and another special evaluation PD-AAG-328-B1, C1). The training component's major shortfall is MWT's failure to inventory staff and training needs as planned, leading to isolated individual training without established benchmarks.  The training's impact cannot be gauged, although it will likely have a limited, short-term effect.  There is no list of potential trainees, trainee projections are inaccurate, and data on trainees entering the program are unavailable.  No records are kept of trainee activities after program completion; although trainees from the Transportation Planning Unit and the Soils Testing Laboratory were found working in training-appropriate areas. Contrary to their original assignments, the Equipment Management Specialist and Heavy Equipment Shop Administrator have done little formal training of management personnel and have been directed to participate in the operational affairs of MWT's Plant Maintenance and Hire Division (PM&HD).  Training facilities are inadequate and, despite the use of individual materials, the lack of teaching aids has limited training utility. It is recommended that the government immediately take a skills inventory; that a comprehensive training plan be made; that the implementing agent, Tippetts-Abett-McCarthy Stratton (TAMS), and USAID meet with MWT staff to review project goals and to assess MWT and PM&HD's commitment to the project; that the Technical Training Specialist re-assert his leadership role in the program; that MWT reconsider filling the Training Coordinator position; that USAID review the scholarship component and clarify TAMS' role in it; that ways of exploiting local potential institutional resources be researched; and that TAMS and counterpart managers consider project orientations for MWT and PM&HD staff.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1979-21 Oct1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-504-C-80-2","","10/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Management training|Administrative occupations|Soil scientists|Technical training|Vocational training|Mechanical technology|Technicians|Laboratory equipment|Science education|School laboratories|Educational materials|On the job training|Indigenous education|Institution building|Transportation education|Transportation planning","Guyana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG328F1.pdf","1,297 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","KOVACH, JOSEPH W.","","21 Oct 1980","","","","EVALUATION STUDY - TRAINING COMPONENT - RURAL FEEDER ROADS PROJECT","","PD-AAG-328-F1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MjA3","Guyana","5040068"
"Evaluates project to reduce LDC dependence on nitrogen fertilizers through use of nitrogen fixation by tropical legumes.  This special evaluation, which is attached to a PES (PD-AAG-348-B1), covers the period 2/77-7/80 and is based on interviews with project staff and visits to research sites. Biological Nitrogen Fixation Project (NifTAL) management and leadership have been commendable, along with the scientific competence and enthusiasm demonstrated by the staff.  NifTAL activities at the University of Hawaii (UH) are not well-integrated with UH's programs. Some 1,493 ""Rhizobium"" isolates from 83 legume species were collected for NifTAL and LDC research.  The isolates are being used for the International Network of Legume Inoculation Trials (INLIC) which test promising strains under various conditions (i.e., when stored under high temperatures).  INLIC also verifies data from research conducted under subcontract at the University of California (UC) on the tolerance of ""Rhizobium"" strains to soil stress factors.  A system for processing data compiled through INLIC has not yet been developed. Small-scale, low-cost inoculant production systems have been developed.  However, since these systems utilize pre-sterilized peat inoculants, their applicability is reduced in LDC's lacking suitable peat deposits. NifTAL has provided training in ""Rhizobium"" technology through short courses in LDC's, an intern program for scientists and technicians, and a graduate program.  Documents have been assembled for use by staff, trainees, and clients abroad and 900 persons in 88 countries have exchanged information with NifTAL.  NifTAL's outreach is nevertheless hampered by lengthy operational procedures. It is recommended that NifTal be continued in an expanded research scope and integration of the project with UH programs and with the UC subcontract be improved; an External Advisory Board be established; a data analysis system for INLIT be developed; other donors provide training and information service funds; A.I.D. assist in improving information dissemination; and staffing be increased before expanding INLIT.","Evaluation period: 1 Feb 1977-31 Jul 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","LEGUMES|Nitrogen fixing bacteria|Nitrogen fixation|RHIZOBIUM|Fertilizer alternatives|Tropical zone|Tropical biology|Biology research|Information dissemination|Reference libraries|Agricultural training|Universities and colleges|Participants|Indigenous education|Soil research|Project change","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG348C1.pdf","977 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","POPENOE, HUGH|HANKINS, ALLEN C.|et al.","","1980","","","","REPORT OF REVIEW TEAM ON BIOLOGICAL NITROGEN FIXATION SYMBIOTIC PROJECT (NIFTAL)","","PD-AAG-348-C1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MjE5","Technical Assistance","9310613"
"Evaluates project in which the Escuela de Benemerita Sociedad Filantropica del Guayas (BSFG) develops a program at the Anzoategui school in Ecuador to provide vocational training (VT) to 860 youth. Evaluation, time frame for which is not specified, is based on the International Institute for Educational Planning's Model for Evaluating Nonformal Education, review of literature, a questionnaire, site visits, and interviews with project staff. The project is moving slowly towards its goals.  VT program administration has been poor -- decisions are made by figurehead and not working administrators and there is confusion over staff roles and responsibilities.  Administrators have been lackadaisical in seeking contributions from industry and in using donated funds effectively. They have also failed to set up links with potential employers and to organize the planned on-the-job training component.  School-industry coordinators were not hired, nor were seven planned program advisory councils set up. The VT program is modern in concept and, except for three Peace Corps Volunteers and a faculty advisor, is taught only by indigenous staff.  A trained manpower needs assessment was made, but did not alter the planned curriculum. Although the latter balances basic academic skills with technical vocational skills, the pre-vocational curriculum has not been upgraded to prepare trainees for specific VT programs.  There is a lack of social, financial, job placement, and follow-up counselling services. Much of the school's equipment is old, but is being replaced. There is a high drop-out rate for first and second year students. Youths who do graduate have found jobs more readily in urban rather than in rural settings. Detailed recommendations are made to correct the project's shortcomings as detailed above.  Key areas of concern include altering the administration so that decisionmaking is at the school level; involving business organizations in curriculum development; and obtaining outside technical assistance in staff and curriculum development and manpower analysis. A PES of 9/80 (PD-AAH-308-Q1) is attached.","Attached to PD-AAN-847","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Curriculum design|Vocational training|Curriculum|Vocational guidance|School buildings|Employment services|Educational centers|Labor surveys|Youth|On the job training|EMPLOYMENT|Faculty|Teacher education|Private voluntary organizations|Beneficiary interviews","Ecuador","","","","","000079 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop a regional soil fertility (SF) research program in Central America to synthesize fertilizer alternatives suited to small farmers' cropping systems. This special contracted evaluation, time frame for which is not specified, is based on interviews with project staff, document review, and site visits, and is attached to a PES (PD-AAG-611-B1). Project implementation was transferred to the Centro Agronomico Tropical de Investigacion y Ensenanza (CATIE). Under the first contractor, the regional SF program was incorporated into national SF programs in Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, Panama, and Nicaragua.  As a result, most of these countries are using the SF field experimentation model.  Unfortunately, the country residents for the national programs, except for Guatemala, are limited in their time spent on field testing. Costa Rica has the most established program including a Soil Science Society and 11 professionals in the Soil Department.  Panama's program is not well known, although representatives attend regional seminars. Despite setbacks in Honduras due to relocation of their SF lab, progress has been made through 30 ongoing field experiments.  Guatemala's program is of secondary importance; their SF lab is well-staffed, but the Soil Department lacks professionals. Nicaragua's SF program is defunct due to political crisis. Although CATIE displays SF expertise, its effectiveness in coordinating the overall program is limited.  Inability to hire a SF Coordinator is of major concern.  CATIE has not provided the needed technical assistance to the national programs, and the regional Soil Analog project has disintegrated.  CATIE's well-trained Central Lab is virtually its only link to the national programs, but it is a good one. Recommendations include hiring a regional SF Coordinator; emphasizing on-site technical assistance from CATIE for the national programs in field experimentation; surveying Nicaragua's soil lab facilities and technician training needs; rejuvenating the Soil Analog project; and ensuring that each Country Resident maintains contact with his national program.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-596-503-T","","9/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Small farms|Farmers|SOIL FERTILITY|SOIL RESEARCH|Agricultural technology|Fertilizers|Fertilizer alternatives|Laboratories|Agricultural research|Professionals|Appropriate technology|Rural areas","Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG611C1.pdf","1,941 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","PEARSON, ROBERT W.","Soil sciences and research","6 Sep 1980","","","","SOIL FERTILITY EVALUATION REPORT","","PD-AAG-611-C1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MjQy","Reg Office Cent America & Panama (ROCAP)","5960063"
"Evaluates project to implement development projects emphasizing improved agricultural production in Niger's Niamey Department. This contracted special evaluation is based on document review, interviews with project staff, and site visits; time frame is not specified. Despite a large promotional campaign, the dry season village literacy training program for men was poorly attended, forcing seven training centers to close.  Only 1-6% of those attending achieved literacy, while a vast majority showed little or no progress.  Teaching materials were in short supply.  Instructors were poorly motivated and often absent due to holding other jobs.  Program evaluation was done infrequently, if at all. In the Centre de Perfectionment Technique (CPT) adult literacy training program at Fandou, Boula, and Simira, literary activities were not documented, making evaluation difficult.  Boula is in its first training cycle, and no testing has yet been performed.  The other two centers did not keep or lost test copies.  Even though male and female trainees and their instructors lived at the training centers, attendance was only 60-70%, with women absent most.  A major reason for absenteeism was fatigue, especially when classes were held in the early afternoon. In the cooperative training component, the Union Nigerienne de Credit et de Cooperation (UNCC) trained some 1,600 persons through formal training courses and through cooperative information presented in literacy programs.  Results were poorly documented and UNCC lacked sufficient field agents to work with newly-formed cooperatives.  Courses were too brief to be comprehensive. In Phase II of this project, it is recommended that:  literacy training be provided only through CPT's; Continuing Education Centers (CEC's) be formed at cooperative seat villages to organize teaching and reading materials; CPT-trained village women be included in CEC programs; CPT curriculum be flexible and deal with local issues; evaluation of CPT training be performed regularly with better documentation of attendance and test results; and CPT/CEC instructors' cooperative training capabilities be upgraded.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/afr-C-1686","","10/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","LITERACY|Learning motivation|Functional literacy|Educational centers|Literacy instruction|Indigenous education|Adult education|Education|Women in development|Agricultural production|Agricultural cooperatives|Villages|Cooperatives|Educational materials|Evaluation|Educational delivery|Project change","Central Africa|West Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAH317A1.pdf","1,018 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","PAINTER, THOMAS M.","","23 Oct 1980","","","","ADULT LITERACY AND COOPERATIVE TRAINING PROGRAMS IN THE NIAMEY DEPARTMENT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT : EVALUATION OF PHASE I ACTIVITIES AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PHASE II","","PD-AAH-317-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MjQ0","Sahel Regional","6250929"
"Evaluates a project to develop self-help enterprises in Kenya by providing technical assistance to agricultural and financial cooperatives.  This special evaluation covers the period 10/1/78-5/31/80, is attached to a PES facesheet (PD-AAG-629-B1), and is based on a review of project documents, site visits, and interviews with project personnel. Technoserve (TNS), the implementing agent, has met all planned outputs.  TNS has reviewed 26 requests for assistance, analyzed 13 subprojects, and implemented five subprojects.  The agricultural and livestock development projects will not realize their full potential due to the project's limited timeframe.  The allied ranching subproject has suffered from badly structured loans, high water costs, a lack of immature steers for purchase, and low beef prices. Ranch operations have improved, however, by adopting accounting and management systems and by training local ranch personnel.  The Drumvale farming cooperative has repaired its basic facilities, e.g., dairy sheds, and has rebuilt two dams.  Drumvale's poultry/egg operation has profited, and its sheep and goat mortality rates have declined.  The Nguu farm cooperative has repaired its facilities, improved its water management, stopped illicit grazing by patrolling its lands, and upgraded its administrative practices. Also under this project, the Harambee, Reli, and Ardhi cooperative credit and savings societies have reported dramatic improvements in their administrative capabilities, with a resultant expansion of operations. One shortfall in this area, however, is the apparent lack of cooperation between TNS and host government financial cooperative institutions. TNS's administrative apparatus is spare but adequate, with many active counterparts.  However, TNS's foreign image requires it to develop a more effective marketing strategy.  It is also recommended that USAID and TNS initiate a livestock production/ranching forum to acquaint technicians, officials, and producers with each other's problems and views.  In addition, USAID need employ only one officer, perhaps the agricultural officer, to monitor TNS activities.","Evaluation period: 1 Oct 1978-31 May 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/afr-C-1656","","7/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural cooperatives|Community self help|Agricultural management|Associations|Cooperatives|Management operations|Management training|Credit cooperatives|Private voluntary organizations|Animal husbandry|Livestock|DAIRY CATTLE|Dams|Poultry|Indigenous education|Institution building|Extension services|Administrative occupations","Kenya","","","001172 - Barnett and Engel","","","English","","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","ENGEL, NAT|NYONGO, PETER A.","","3 Jul 1980","","OPG GRANT NO.

"Evaluates project to enable Movimiento Derechos de la Mujer (MDM), a Peruvian private voluntary organization, to inform and advise women in urban slums of their legal and social rights. Evaluation, which is written entirely in Spanish, covers the period 9/79-10/80 and is consists of the special evaluation prepared by the Inter-American Legal Services Association. The evaluation focuses on the technical and legal aspects of MDM's work and assesses MDM's capabilities in the field of legal assistance to the poor. After a presentation of the methodology used to prepare the evaluation, the author examines each of the following questions: (1) Can a legal services program operate efficiently with a volunteer base?

"Evaluates project to increase the capabilities of Caribbean nations to design, implement, and evaluate food/nutrition (FN) programs. This special evaluation, attached to a PES (PD-AAG-608-A1), covers the period 6/79-11/80 and is based on meetings of a joint USAID/Caribbean Food and Nutrition Institute (CFNI) team, including representatives from host country governments. The project continues to progress well; it seems likely that its purpose will be achieved.  Significant gains have been made through the Caribbean Community in adopting a regional FN strategy that will necessitate a major expansion of CFNI's role.  Some training activities, especially the 3-day seminars for health personnel on diabetes and obesity, have fallen behind schedule but additional seminars and courses are planned in order to meet output targets. CFNI has also greatly increased its capability to produce and distribute educational materials and to provide technical assistance (TA) to member nations in developing national FN programs. Although many countries have enunciated FN policies and nine have adopted formal plans, it has been much more difficult to get commitments for funds and personnel to formulate and implement actual programs. Very few countries have achieved the multisectoral planning and coordination envisioned for the project. It is recommended that the project be extended for 1 year and that additional funds be granted in order to:  (1) extend the TA staff and increase member nations' self-sufficiency in designing, implementing, and evaluating national FN programs; (2) finance the final 3-month course in project implementation and an additional course in FN surveillance; (3) provide in-service training for graduates of the community nutrition program; (4) hold a second meeting of the national heads of nutrition units; (5) develop an anemia-specific intervention and develop a regional strategy for anemia reduction; (6) update the strategy for control of diarrheal disease and malnutrition, especially among children; and (7) support continued CFNI distribution of prototype educational materials which can be locally reproduced.","Evaluation period: 1 Jun 1979-30 Nov 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Development project design|Development project implementation|Indigenous education|Development project evaluation|Technical training|Nutrition education|Nutrition|Educational materials|Extension services|Health policy|Sector planning|Management training|Nutrition improvement|Nutrition surveillance|Workshops|Regional development|Institution building|Project change","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG608B1.pdf","2,483 KB","008563 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to control or reduce aflatoxin production in maize. This special contracted evaluation covers the period 10/77 to 3/80 and is based on an onsite review. The University of Missouri project team has been stymied by a lack of effective methods to identify resistant maize selections. Although between 500 to 1,000 selections of maize were evaluated, the researchers have been unable to identify resistant materials experimentally. Examples of the methods used include:  (1) insertion of a hypodermic needle through the husk and injection of A. flavus spores into the kernels; and (2) inoculation by pin board which involved injuring a double row of kernels and inoculating them with about 1.5 ml of a suspension of a million spores per ml.  The first method did not contaminate a sufficient number of kernels for an effective evaluation; the second method was too severe, contaminating all varieties. However, a promising laboratory screening method has been developed that would permit screening of corn lines and crosses in the offseason.  Varieties from 20 countries will be selected for testing in 1980.  Six research papers and one review publication were produced by the research team during this period (XD-AAG-658-1). The capability of the research team is not in question. Instead, it was an administrative decision to build a P-3 containment laboratory which slowed progress.  The 2-year construction of the lab prevented the researchers from determining early in the project that their inoculation techniques were ineffective.  The evaluation team recommends a 2-year unfunded extension of the project.  Other recommended actions include refinement and modification of the inoculation techniques; reassessment of sampling size and sampling procedures as well as the development of uniformity trials; a review of the aflatoxin-level criterion for resistance in corn kernels; strengthening of international cooperation and ties; and development of an annual report and publication of research accomplishments in normal scientific channels.","Evaluation period: 1 Oct 1977-31 Mar 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Toxic substances|Maize|Agricultural research|Varietal research|Crop disease control|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG658C1.pdf","1,230 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","DIENER, URBAN L.|MOSS, DALE N.|et al.","","9 Apr 1980","","","","AFLATOXIN REDUCTION IN MAIZE - EXTERNAL PROJECT REVIEW (4/8-4/9/80)","","PD-AAG-658-C1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3Mjcw","Technical Assistance","9311181"
"Evaluates project to institutionalize a management training capability in LDC family planning institutions.  This special evaluation, which is attached to a PES (PD-AAG-660-B1), covers the period 9/77-3/80 and is based on site visits, interviews with trainees, and a review of files. The Center for Population Activities (CEFPA) has met its contractual obligations.  CEFPA has a strong board and dedicated staff who have developed a good relationship with their counterparts and USAID's.  Its organizational experience and flexibility should not be lost to A.I.D. Still, upgrading the scheduling and staffing of training programs and holding debriefings after each training event are recommended. To date, 255 LDC family planning personnel have been trained in 11 training events. Although it is premature to judge the long-range effects of this training, its impact so far has been limited. More country-specific training materials are needed and trainee selection criteria must be made more stringent; candidates in Mauritius were unsatisfactory.  CEFPA also needs to develop an effective follow-up to its programs and a better needs assessment. Trainees claimed that the training, while useful, was difficult to apply due to host country bureaucratic procedures, unsympathetic advisors and the shortness of the training time. In Nepal, planning and the delegation of authority were cited as the most frequently applied skills, while in Mauritius, the use of communication and management skills was cited. Institutionalization of the training function within counterpart agencies, Family Planning-Maternal Child Care in Nepal and the Mauritius Family Planning Association, will not occur.  This is due not only to the organizational and functional problems within the two agencies, but also to a perception of training as a reward and a lack of staff commitment.  The latter, in turn, has been due to CEFPA's failure to coach top staff in the use of trained supervisors. Expansion of CEFPA's technical assistance function to include such coaching is one of several actions recommended as a way to pursue institutionalization more vigorously.","Evaluation period: 1 Sep 1977-30 Apr 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","4/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|FAMILY PLANNING|Technical assistance|Family planning occupations|Medical education|Workshops|Indigenous education|Participants|Family planning services|Management training|Educational materials|Beneficiary interviews","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG660C1.pdf","1,408 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","MUNCH, NEAL J.|KEEKEE, MINOR|CHEEMA, JATINDER","","30 Apr 1980","","","","TRAINING OF FAMILY PLANNING MANAGERS","","PD-AAG-660-C1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3Mjc2","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","9320627"
"Evaluates project to obtain reliable socioeconomic data on rural farm and non-farm households to improve the Government of Bolivia's rural planning capacity.  This Annual Evaluation, which is attached to a PES (PD-AAG-579-B1), covers the period 6/79-4/80.  No methodology is specified. Data processing and integration have been delayed by 20-month late arrival of the Chief Resident Economic Analyst. Progress so far has been as follows:  (1) The Ministry of Agriculture and Campesino Affair's (MACA) planning capacity has not been upgraded, nor its staff increased. MACA's Statistical Division, however, has improved its ability to conduct studies and collect data.  (2) Cost increases caused by a year's delay prevented completion of the Rural Household Study (RHS).  Less data can now be collected, and RHS should be reduced to a pilot project. (3) The National Statistical Institute (INE) is in the process of producing edited data tapes for the Socioeconomic Farm Survey, which is due 9/80.  (4) Work demands on the author delayed completion of the Southern Valley Survey for almost 3 years and reduced its utility.  (5) INE is processing and verifying 2 years of data for the Credit Analysis Study.  Edited tape will be ready by 12/80. Data collected for the Impact Analysis is now on computer tape.  The Rural Financial Market Analysis has produced publications such as ""The Role of Credit on Small Households in Bolvia"".  (6) Although National Crop Technology Survey data were collected and coded, these data should be reviewed for accuracy.  (7) The Traditional Practices Study was implemented late, yet has been run smoothly by the Rural Development Services Team. Twelve months of data from 123 homes were collected.  The role of women in rural households should be included in this study. The project has shown that this type of project is time-consuming for A.I.D. management and that the heavy workload and conflicting demands make it unwise to rely on A.I.D. direct-hire employees to draft analytical documents.  It is recommended that the project's implementation and budget plans be revised as per annexes to the evaluation.","Evaluation period: 15 JUN 1979-15 APR 1980|Bibcode changed from 32 to 22 2008-05-19","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Rural development|Small farms|Farmers|Data collection|Data analysis|Economic analysis|Beneficiary interviews","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG579C1.pdf","1,039 KB","008515 - USAID.

"Evaluates subproject of the African Women in Development Project to provide women in 12 villages in Senegal with lighter work alternatives of a socioeconomic nature within a pre-cooperative structure. This special contracted evaluation, time frame for which is not specified, is based on document review, visits to six representative villages, and interviews with project staff and villagers. Since not all inputs have been acquired, few planned activities have been achieved.  Both men and women have made substantial contributions to the project, including asisting with hut construction.  Women have assisted in project design and activities; as a result, their leadership and organizational skills have improved markedly. Women did not, however, demonstrate an adequate understanding of financial management of their earned revenues.  Poor weather conditions and drought have delayed well construction, prevented growth of the eucalyptus trees planted to obtain firewood, and damaged the project's manioc and niebe crops.  Fencing around the eucalyptus trees and crops has supplied protection from grazing animals.  The planned village pharmacies are not operating due to the high cost of obtaining U.S. medicines.  A sheep pen was constructed, but it does not provide an adequate air flow for the sheep, making them susceptible to disease during the rainy season.  Two millet mills were installed, one of which is functioning. Unfortunately, the women lack the financial training to successfully use the millet as a source of income. Evaluation of the project activities has been on a regular basis with project managers providing informal training to women during site visits. It is recommended that:  the project be extended one year without increased funding; women receive systematic training in record-keeping, debt amortization, and depreciation; the markets for the project goods produced be assessed; extension agents assist the women in sheep-raising and alternative tree cultivation; the sheep-pen design be closely monitored; and waivers be prepared to allow the purchase of less-costly medicines from UNICEF or from other non-U.S. sources.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Associations|Community development|Sheep|Agricultural product marketing|Millet|Trees|Agricultural production|CROP YIELD|Financial management|Management training|On the job training|Development project design|Development project implementation|Development project evaluation|FIREWOOD|Rain|Labor intensive technology|Community self help|Project change","Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG648E1.pdf","409 KB","000695 - Jeffalyn Johnson and Associates, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","","","1 Apr 1980","","","","AFRICAN WOMEN IN DEVELOPMENT : TIVAOUANE EVALUATION REPORT","","PD-AAG-648-E1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MzE4","Africa Regional","698038810"
"Evaluates subproject of the African Women in Development Project to develop the Gara Cloth Cooperative (GCC) for women in Sierra Leone. This special contracted evaluation covers the period 6/76-3/77; no methodology is specified. Although quality, marketable items are being produced, the system for ordering and distributing raw materials to GCC's producer members has been disorganized, and cash payment to the women producing the finished goods is slow.  As a result, many members have lost confidence in GCC. Raw materials must be imported with costly Government of Sierra Leone (GOSL) levies (although GCC is eventually reimbursed).  Sales and production facilities are outdated and many urban GCC members have sold their goods to separate retail outlets for higher profit.  GCC's accounting system is poor, and cost/benefit information has not been provided to GOSL. A GCC Executive Committee (EC) was established, but members require coop-specific management training.  Many EC members are illiterate, limiting the amount of management training they can absorb. Based on these findings, it is recommended that the project be redesigned so that:  (1) coop management training is given to EC members; (2) a raw materials distribution system is developed; (3) debts are repaid to GCC members; (4) raw materials are purchased in bulk to lower costs; (5) showrooms and garment styles and fabrics are updated; (6) orders are prioritized to assure timely delivery; (7) sales and marketing skills of personnel are upgraded by on-the-job-training; (8) overseas contacts are made to assist in penetrating foreign markets; (9) an accounting design is established for GOSL; (10) GCC is identified by GOSL as a potential source of foreign revenue and contributor to the balance of trade; (11) problems caused by GOSL's import levy are resolved; and (12) GCC is protected against foreign producers who are establishing automated manufacturing centers in Sierra Leone. At the time of this evaluation several problems were resolved, e.g., record-keeping procedures were developed, and designs for a salesroom and production center were drawn up.","Evaluation period: 1 Jun 1976-31 Mar 1977","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Associations|Institution building|On the job training|Accounting|Financial records systems|Cooperatives|Management operations|Management training|Marketing|Handicrafts|Industrial facilities|Artisans|Customs operations|Retail marketing|Project change","Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG649A1.pdf","469 KB","000695 - Jeffalyn Johnson and Associates, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","","","1 Apr 1980","","","","AFRICAN WOMEN IN DEVELOPMENT : GARA CLOTH INDUSTRY EVALUATION REPORT","","PD-AAG-649-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MzE5","Africa Regional","698038802"
"Evaluates subproject in which the Voltaic Scientific Research Center (VSRC) studies the feasibility of training Sahelian women for non-formal education in Upper Volta. This special contracted evaluation covers the period 3/77-1/80 and is based on document review and an interview with the AID/W desk officer for Upper Volta. This feasibility study, which prepares for the Training of Women in the Sahel Project (6860226), is a subproject of the African Women in Development Project. The feasibility study was submitted one and a half years late due to budgetary constraints within VSRC and the necessity to travel great distances over poor roads to obtain research data. At the time of submission, project 6860226 had already been designed, funded, and partially implemented. The study does provide a comprehensive overview of Sahelian women's socioeconomic roles in different ethnic groups. Consequently, the study may still have impact upon project 6860226. The study covers past formal education programs and recommends various project activities, including agricultural training programs and health and nutrition educaton programs. A structure for staffing and coordination of these activities is also suggested. Results of a questionnaire administered to village populations and an extensive bibliography are included. It is concluded that even if the study had been available prior to design of the project, additional data collection would have been necessary to provide more specific information needed for the design of project 6860226. Based on these findings and conclusions, it is recommended that in the future, project design studies be conducted shortly before arrival of the pre-design team.","'AID No. 698-0388.8'|Evaluation period: 1 Mar1977-31 Jan1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Feasibility studies|Agricultural management|Agricultural training|Health education|Nutrition education|Nonformal education","Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG650E1.pdf","243 KB","000695 - Jeffalyn Johnson and Associates, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation","","","","1 Apr 1980","","","","AFRICAN WOMEN IN DEVELOPMENT : INCOME PRODUCING FEASIBILITY STUDY","","PD-AAG-650-E1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MzIw","Africa Regional","698038808"
"Evaluates the agricultural component of a project to promote integrated rural development in Mauritania.  This special evaluation, which is attached to a PES facesheet (PD-AAG-638-B1) covers the period 9/77-5/80 and is based on onsite review. The intent of the project was to develop replicable agricultural and livestock interventions in Mauritania's Tenth Region, the nation's bread basket.  The two types of activities are integrated only in the sense that they are under the same management. The project paper emphasized the testing of cereals/legume crop rotation schemes in conjunction with the use of animal traction and fertilizer. However, little or no progress had been made.  Demonstration plots are in the process of being fenced in, and no crops have been planted. Instead, the project management has added new elements -- a nursery, irrigated vegetable gardening, tree farming, and chicken farming.  The evaluation team feels that there is little potential for success in these areas, and that they should be given lowest priority.  The team equally discounts the likelihood of success for the planned cooperative development. Activities requiring irrigation should also be dropped.  The evaluators feel that project management attempted too much, and that the slow pace of the project is due to a failure to set priorities. The project should be extended for 2 additional years.  The major emphasis of the project during the remainder of its life should be on demonstrating improved and replicable technical packages. Innovations which do not show immediate replicability should not be tested.  Future efforts should emphasize dryland cereal production and the testing of crop rotation systems.  Greater efforts should be made to integrate agriculture and livestock.  The idea of using tractors should be dropped, and animal traction and the use of manure as fertilizer should be promoted. Recommendations for future projects and studies are also included.  A report on the livestock component is attached (PD-AAG-638-F1).","Evaluation period: 1 Sep 1977-1 May 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/afr-C-1651","","5/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Pilot projects|Integrated rural development|Agricultural production|DRY FARMING|Demonstration|Farms|Agricultural technology|Agricultural inputs|Crop diversification|Cropping patterns|Appropriate technology|Rural areas|Project change","Mauritania","","","001690 - Development Assistance Corp.","","","English","","Onsite evaluation","","MURPHY, ERNEST L.","","21 May 1980","","","","AGRO-ECONOMIC EVALUATION OF THE GUIDIMAKA IRD PROJECT","","PD-AAG-638-C1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MzIy","Mauritania","6820201"
"Evaluates subproject of the African Women in Development Project to assist women's vegetable cooperatives in 13 villages in the Casamance region of Senegal to increase their commercial vegetable production. This special evaluation, the time frame for which is unspecified, is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with villagers. Vegetable gardens were reported planted by women in seven of the 13 targeted villages, but only two of the four villages visited had producing gardens. Women reported that crops were planted at the wrong time, causing loss of crops, income, and coop membership. The 25 installed wells are operational but often run dry. Only two of the 26 pumps are working since spare parts are difficult to obtain, and there is a shortage of maintenance personnel. Project vehicles are broken, and all but two donkeys have died from disease. Supervision and provision of technical assistance by Government of Senegal extension agents were uncoordinated. Profits from the produce were difficult to ascertain since the women were reluctant to release this information for fear of being taxed. It is clear, however, that profits were minimal. While training in cooperative and financial management training was provided irregularly to women, some did not understand the concepts presented. Only 10 women attended a regional seminar on vegetable production due to lack of advanced notice and transportation. Only a few of the 13 planned literacy training centers were constructed, and those trained are primarily men. Women do not have time to attend or are uninterested. The centers are also used for child care and community meetings. In general, women did not evidence a desire for this project; rather, it was imposed upon them. However, the nutrition level in the villages has increased from consumption of the produce. For similar projects in the future it is recommended that marketing studies be conducted to avoid market saturation; training be provided in vegetable preservation, vehicle maintenance, and animal care; and that project inputs arrive at the villages in carefully-spaced intervals.","'AID No. 698-0388.7, Senegal'","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Associations|Financial management|Villages|Cooperatives|Financing|Management operations|Management training|Marketing|Vegetables|Agricultural product marketing|Crop production|VEHICLE REPAIR|WELLS|Agricultural extension|Seminars|Literacy instruction|Beneficiary interviews","Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG650C1.pdf","439 KB","000695 - Jeffalyn Johnson and Associates, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","","","1 Apr 1980","","","","AFRICAN WOMEN IN DEVELOPMENT : CASAMANCE VEGETABLE GROWERS EVALUATION REPORT","","PD-AAG-650-C1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MzIz","Africa Regional","698038807"
"Evaluates the livestock and range management component of a project to promote integrated rural development in Mauritania.  This special evaluation, which is attached to a PES facesheet (PD-AAG-638-B1) and another special evaluation (PD-AAG-638-C1), covers the period 9/77-5/80 and is based on a review of documents and an onsite visit. There were relatively few livestock, and these tended to be in fair to poor condition.  The Guidimaka was obviously overgrazed and was below average in rainfall.  The project has made very limited progress due to a combination of factors:  (1) The project paper and Pro Ag were very vague, providing less than technically sound recommendations.  (2) The project management and implementation staff did not have the technical knowledge to supplement and correct the PP design.  (3) The remote location of the project site magnified all the other problems. Accomplishments include: assignment of all advisors; completion of 90% of the planned project housing; fencing and clearing of three agronomic units; fencing of a range demonstration unit (450 ha) and 25 ha of forest research lands; cultivation of a forest and garden nursery; installation of wells; and acquisition of vehicles, livestock and commodities.  The author concludes that the project outputs should be limited to a few interventions aimed at increasing economic efficiency. Also range, animal, and social data should be collected for the development of a technological production package. Lack of adequate backstopping from Pacific Consultants caused many difficulties for the PC team.  An experienced person with a strong livestock-range-agricultural background is needed to consult with the project team on a periodic or full-time basis.  The project should be extended to 12/82.  Detailed recommendations for a revised project are outlined.","Evaluation period: 1 Sep 1977-31 May 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","LIVESTOCK|Animal husbandry|Range management|Agricultural technology|Agricultural inputs|Demonstration|Farms|DRY FARMING|Project change","Mauritania","","","","","","English","","Onsite evaluation","","DICKEY, JAMES R.","Livestock","12 May 1980","","","","EVALUATION REPORT OF THE LIVESTOCK AND RANGE MANAGEMENT PORTION OF THE GUIDIMAKA I.R.D.

"Evaluates subproject of the African Women in Development Project to study the feasibility of women in Upper Volta producing silkworms from mulberry trees and vegetal tannin from acacia trees for marketing. This special contracted evaluation, time frame for which is not specified, is based on a review of two pre-feasibility studies and an interview with the project manager. The silkworm production pre-feasibility study provides background on silkworm and mulberry tree cultivation and concludes that silkworm production is viable in Upper Volta. It also recommends undertaking a 2-year project to determine the feasibility of women producing silkworms. Although the study thoroughly examines silk and mulberry tree production and its economic viability, it does not explain the research methodology used nor women's involvement in silk production and its income-generating potential. Despite its drawbacks, the study may be used as a guide to design a subsequent project-specific, pre-design study. Recommendations include that USAID contact local Goverment of Upper Volta (GOUV) officials to ascertain the study's relevance; that GOUV and local support be obtained before implementing such a project; that a women in development specialist and economist be part of the project-design team; and that the present study be used to define the scope of the pre-design study. The vegetal tannin production pre-feasibility study begins with technical information on acacia and tannin and on the world market for tannin. It concludes that although production of vegetal tannin is uneconomical since it would meet insurmountable competition on the world market, it could be profitable if a global reforestation scheme were undertaken. It recommends cultivating acacia. This study fails to examine the income-generating potential for women, how women would participate in production at the village level, and the effect on the present local tanners of a large-scale tannin enterprise by women. The study's suggestions should be disregarded until information on the research methodology used is obtained and GOUV is consulted regarding the study's accuracy.","'AID No. 698-0388.5, Upper Volta'","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Feasibility studies|SERICULTURE|Mulberries|Plantations|Tanning|Industry|Women in development|Development research|Marketing research|Project change","Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG650A1.pdf","353 KB","000695 - Jeffalyn Johnson and Associates, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation","","","","1 Apr 1980","","","","AFRICAN WOMEN IN DEVELOPMENT : SILKWORM AND VEGETAL TANNIN STUDY EVALUATION REPORT","","PD-AAG-650-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MzI1","Africa Regional","698038805"
"Evaluates subproject of the African Women in Development Project to provide day care services, which include health, nutrition, and family planning components, to women at three sites in Ghana (Asokore, Bawalashie, and Kona).  This special contracted evaluation, time frame for which is not specified, is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel.  The YWCA is implementing the subproject. Most planned outputs have been achieved.  Two buildings were converted to day care centers in Bawalashie and Asokore.  The buildings are small and in poor condition, causing some parents to prevent their children from attending, and need additional equipment.  Despite these constraints, the village communities have widely supported the centers. A total of 159 children are being served by the two centers, against a target of 150-200. Six women attendants, aged 18 to 21, were trained in nutrition, hygiene, and child care.  Although their rapport with the children was good, the turnover is high since many left to be married. Only one of their replacements was trained.  Older women were trained as supervisors.  Community health nurses from the Ministry of Health instructed village mothers in high protein diets and food preparation and storage, and developed a systematic program of check-ups and innoculations for day care children.  Family planning services were not well-received.  The Ministry of Agriculture's Home Extension Unit provided the centers with sorghum and wheat, and Catholic Relief Services provided milk.  Other problems included inadequate USAID funding, which forced YWCA to assume training and overhead costs; and drought, which prevented Bawalashie farmers from supplementing tuition costs and from providing food for lunches. It is recommended that:  the project be extended and improved; YWCA's request for more funding be approved; day care staff be comprised of women of different ages; current facilities be replaced or the existing space maximized through use of the surrounding area; and income-generating activities include handicrafts when drought precludes farming activities.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Day care services|Child feeding programs|CHILD NUTRITION|FAMILY PLANNING|Public health care|Nurses|Rain|Handicrafts|Women|Private voluntary organizations|Nutrition education|Sanitation education|Mothers|Health education|Management training|Child care|Technical training|Beneficiary interviews|Project change","Ghana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG649C1.pdf","497 KB","000695 - Jeffalyn Johnson and Associates, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","","","1 Apr 1980","","","","AFRICAN WOMEN IN DEVELOPMENT : GHANA DAY CARE EVALUATION REPORT","","PD-AAG-649-C1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MzI2","Africa Regional","698038803"
"Evaluates subproject of the African Women in Development Project to establish a pre-cooperative structure providing women in Senegal's Kassack Nord with a variety of profitable socioeconomic activities. This special contracted evaluation covers the period 1/79-2/80 and is based on document review and site visits. The project is not progressing well.  Project implementation was delayed 15 months by bureaucratic and budgetary difficulties between USAID and the Government of Senegal's (GOS) Societe d'Amenagement et d'Exploitation du Delta (SAED).  The planned Association of Rural Interest (AIR) is not operational, although several seminars on its organization have been held. Funding for project inputs was inadequate in relation to targeted outputs. The grain mill, maternity clinic, poultry hut, and fabric dying hut were constructed, but are not yet functioning.  Some six ha of rice fields are being prepared for harvest, but are not ready for cultivation.  As a result, the villagers must live in temporary camps near GOS rice fields for five months each year, thus lessening pressure on SAED to implement project activities. Most outputs have not been realized.  The only perceptible outputs achieved have been the vegetable gardens; literacy training (which pre-dated the project); hygiene and maternity instruction conducted by a trained midwife; and sewing and knitting lessons from the project coordinator.  Although successful activities have been favorably received, there is little evidence that they have taken place, as planned, within the pre-cooperative AIR structure. It is recommended that:  Kassack Nord rice fields be completed before starting other project activities; a feasibility/marketing study of planned activities be conducted; an AIR be made operational and a plan developed which coordinates inputs with women's contributions and focuses on activities with the greatest hope for success; AIR members receive training in bookkeeping, equipment maintenance, and cooperative management; SAED's management skills be upgraded; and USAID monitoring be improved.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1979-29 Feb1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Education|Associations|Hygiene|Literacy instruction|Agricultural production|RICE|Handicrafts|Feasibility studies|Villages|Institution building|Communities|Gardening|Cooperatives|Management training|Financial management|Sanitation education","Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG649E1.pdf","341 KB","000695 - Jeffalyn Johnson and Associates, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","","","1 Apr 1980","","","","AFRICAN WOMEN IN DEVELOPMENT : KASSACK NORD EVALUATION REPORT","","PD-AAG-649-E1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MzI3","Africa Regional","698038804"
"Evaluates project to integrate women into the economies of developing African countries.  Evaluation covers the period 6/76-9/80 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project staff. This project consists of seven subprojects (SP's):  Gara Cloth Industry-698038802; Ghana Day Care-698038803; Kassack Nord-698038804; Silkworm and Vegetal Tannin Study-698038805; Casamance Vegetable Growers-698038807; and Income Producing Feasibility Study-698038808; and Tivaouane-698038810. While SP's conform to A.I.D.'s criteria and are inherently replicable, most SP objectives were not stated quantifiably, nor were baseline data furnished, making performance difficult to measure.  The findings of the few feasibility studies that were conducted were either not used or the long lapse of time between the study and project commencement rendered the results irrelevant. Market studies also were not used; as a result, the commodities produced in the SP's were introduced into already saturated markets.  Budgetary levels were insufficient to meet the scopes of projected outputs and to supply planned inputs. The delivery of funds and inputs was often delayed, but project planning rarely took these delays into account.  The inputs for several of the SP's were technically inappropriate, since there were no personnel trained to maintain them.  None of the SP's included in their designs the routine evaluations which might have averted poor project management in several instances.  The above factors suggest that women in development projects do not enjoy a high A.I.D. priority. Nonetheless, the SP's that did succeed in generating enthusiasm among the women.  Most SP's could be salvaged with appropriate funding, technical assistance, management, and monitoring. It is recommended that:  a management training component be included in each SP; feasibility studies be conducted prior to project design; measurable objectives be incorporated in project designs; sufficient time and funding be allotted for implementation; regular evaluations be conducted; project inputs be technologically appropriate; and women assist in project planning.","See also PN-AAK-439|Evaluation period: 1 Jun 1976-30 Sep 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Rural areas|Villages|Income generation|Cooperatives|Feasibility studies|Agricultural production|Handicrafts|Health education|Technical training","West Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG648B1.pdf","824 KB","000695 - Jeffalyn Johnson and Associates, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Evaluation team|Onsite evaluation|Multi country evaluation","","","","1 Apr 1980","","","","FINAL REPORT : AFRICAN WOMEN IN DEVELOPMENT","","PD-AAG-648-B1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MzI4","Africa Regional","6980388"
"Evaluates project to carry out basic research on the control of root-knot nematodes in developing countries.  This special contracted evaluation, attached to a PES (PD-AAG-654-B1), covers the period 6/75-1/80 and is based on an onsite review. The project was implemented by North Carolina State University and has produced excellent results.  Originally limited to six regions, new regions were added as the project progressed. Outputs include the development of a network of 104 cooperating scientists from 58 countries; completion of a crop loss assessment survey; evaluation of more than 700 living populations of Meloidogyne; identification of Meloidogyne-resistant food crops, cultivars, and germplasm; associations with international crop development centers; and 182 research publications. Satisfactory progress was made in the identification of Meloidogyne-resistant food crops, cultivars, and germplasm as well as in the evaluation of environmental parameters associated with Meloidogyne host-parasite relations.  However, progress was considerably slower in evaluating responses to crop rotation and in the implementation of plant protection schemes.  The project demonstrated the wisdom of allocating limited resources to local cooperators -- which resulted in their dedication to the program on the basis of scientific rather than financial advantages.  The use of regional coordinators, on the other hand, did not work well.  If used at all, they should be selected after the project is in operation so that scientists with the greatest interest in the project can be identified.  The team strongly recommends that the project be extended and that the following actions be taken: (1) the addition of a professional position in the field of technology transfer; (2) additional training of international cooperators; (3) provision of a plant breeder and an ecology consultant; (4) appointment and termination of regional coordinators and cooperators at the discretion of the principal investigator; (5) close coordination with the USDA/SEA/SR Committee on Crop Loss Assessment Systems.","Evaluation period: 1 Jun 1975-1 Jan 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","PEST CONTROL|Agricultural research|Nematodes|Crop disease control|Crop pests|Crop diseases|Crop losses|CROP ROTATION|Cropping patterns|Institution building|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG654C1.pdf","1,068 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","BIRD, GEORGE W.|BLACK, CLANTON C., JR.|et al.","","7 Feb 1980","","","","INTERNATIONAL MELOIDOGYNE PROJECT - PROJECT REVIEW (FEBRUARY 6-7, 1980)","","PD-AAG-654-C1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MzMw","Technical Assistance","9310614"
"Evaluates project to integrate family planning information and education in formal and nonformal home economics programs in LDC's. Evaluation covers the period 1/1/78-4/21/80 and is based on site visits in Jamaica, Panama, Sierra Leone, Thailand, and the Philippines and discussions with AHEA (American Home Economics Association, the project contractor) regional directors. Each country made good progress in integrating FP information into home economics training in both formal school systems and rural outreach programs.  AHEA conducted numerous international and national conferences and workshops. Educational materials produced by AHEA are being used in all country programs and by international organizations. ""Working with Villagers"", in particular, was highly regarded.  In many countries, local newsletters and journals are being published. Cooperation with international family planning agencies, USAID missions, and host-country ministries was very good.  Planned research studies, needs assessments, and evaluation projects are being carried out. Time-consuming procedures for approving project activities was a major problem for AHEA. Also, AHEA management was handicapped by personality conflicts and an inexperienced staff. Evaluators recommend that A.I.D. continue the project as a grant rather than a contract and reduce the number of reports required. Annual workplans for AHEA and country programs should be approved or revised promptly.  AHEA personnel should be authorized to proceed with implementation without interim approval of all details.  AHEA management could be improved by selection of a staff with LDC experience, language capability, and regard for other cultures; more rapid responses to country proposals; and the delegation of greater authority to regional offices and country coordinators.  Other recommendations include the provision of funding to complete the training of extension workers; greater distribution of training materials; conducting surveys to determine if FP goals are being met; and intensifying country programs. Country and regional reports and an AHEA response to this evaluation are attached.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1978-21 Apr1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","6/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Indigenous education|Household management|Education|Extension services|Family planning promotion programs|Family planning|Information storage and retrieval systems|Family planning education|Educational materials|Nonformal education|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG965A1.pdf","5,406 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Multi country evaluation|Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","BOYNTON, WILLARD H.|MURPHY, ELAINE M.|WEIDEMANN, CELIA J.","","3 Jun 1980","","AID/PHA-C-1178; AID/DSPE-G-0010","","EVALUATION OF FAMILY PLANNING ASSISTANCE THROUGH HOME ECONOMICS","","PD-AAG-965-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MzMy","Development Support","9363006"
"Evaluates project to provide basic health management training and assistance to public health officials in nine Caribbean nations. This contracted special evaluation covers the project's first 18 months up to 11/80 and is based on a review of documents, site visits, and interviews with project personnel and beneficiaries. Interpersonal skills training, the first of four training efforts, benefitted 819 upper, middle, and lower level managers in Barbados, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Belize, and Antigua. However, no orgranizational impact assessment can be made yet.  Unlike other training and assistance efforts, team building training was wisely linked to the Model District Health Teams (MDHT) program.  Initial responses to training and MDHT have been positive.  Management information system needs were assessed for participating nations.  A materials resource center was established on Antigua; hurricanes have delayed those of other nations. CARICOM's dedicated staff has upgraded its ability to implement regional programs. It is recommended that training in program design and implementation for top level managers be given in conjunction with the Caribbean Development Bank, which is willing to expand into this area. Shortfalls include hasty project planning and implementation, as seen in the budget, which omitted major special activity and contractor costs, and in the training program, which began without adequate materials. Further, training has not been standardized and the first and third training efforts duplicate each other. CARICOM itself should implement the third effort, avoiding duplication by stressing management skills, tools, and techniques.  Technical assistance goals in organizational analysis, health planning, and information systems cannot be met in the time allotted.  Host countries are dissatisfied with assistance in the first two areas.  CARICOM's close monitoring of the finances of the training contractor, Westinghouse Health Systems, has led to a critical lack of communication between the two. Finally, little has been done to create an ongoing skills development capacity in participating institutions.","Evaluation period: 1 May 1979-30 Nov 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","11/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Manuals and handbooks|Labor research|Health occupations|Health care planning|Health policy|Health professional education|Health care administration|Management training|Indigenous education|Medical education|Educational materials|Management information systems|Development project design|Development project implementation|Development project evaluation|Health|Information storage and retrieval systems|Beneficiary interviews","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG970B1.pdf","2,775 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Multi country evaluation|Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation|Interim evaluation","","WORSTELL, MARY E.|NAGEL, JOHN S.|BLAISE, HANS C.","","6 Nov 1980","","","","REPORT ON A MID-TERM EVALUATION OF BASIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT IN NINE CARIBBEAN COUNTRIES","","PD-AAG-970-B1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MzYw","Caribbean Regional","5380019"
"Evaluates project implementing a multi-sectoral development program in the Luwu area of Indonesia.  Evaluation covers the period 1/1/75-2/29/80 and is based on a 4-month onsite review. Even though only 34% of the project funds have been disbursed, the project is already having a positive impact on Luwu small farmers. Growth rates of 17.5% for food production, 18.6% for food exports, 12.5% for food consumption per capita, and 12.6% for net income per food farmers have been attained. Because of contracting and project design problems, the project will extend over 6 years rather than 4.  While project outputs are generally progressing well, the road improvement and the farmer cooperative centers (FCC's) have suffered from under-planning and under-budgeting.  The FCC's have been expanded more than 10 times that originally planned, and the road rehabilitation plan was completely redesigned.  Also, the multi-sectoral nature of the project -- which requires one ministry to coordinate the activities of other ministries -- created some management difficulties for the government.  However, an effective system of project coordination has evolved.  Recommendations include the following: (1) Despite cost overruns, all the subprojects should be completed.  (2) Project focus should shift to agricultural intensification programs.  (3) A coordinating project treasurer from the Ministry of Finance should be appointed.  (4) Subproject treasurers should be made responsibile for bringing requests for reimbursement and related documentation up to date and should include complete analysis of expenditures in their reports.  (5) Subproject managers should be required to submit detailed progress reports. (6) USAID should inform the project management of changes in the CAP with regard to outputs and inputs.  (7) Studies outlining future POM (planning, operations, and maintenance) programs should be prepared for all subprojects.  (8) Similar multi-sectoral development projects should be implemented in other areas of Indonesia.  (9) Evaluations should be continued on an annual basis.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1975-1 Feb 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","EXPORTS|Road construction|Financial records systems|Financial management|Integrated rural development|Agricultural production|Agricultural cooperatives|Delivery systems|Agricultural inputs|Agricultural extension|Agricultural policy|Agricultural planning|Agricultural technology|FARM INCOME|Farm management|Roads|Rural areas|IRRIGATION|MIGRATION","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG594A1.pdf","81,563 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"Evaluates project to develop replicable maternal child health (MCH) and family planning (FP) services in the Gambia and Benin.  This final evaluation, which is attached to a PES (DOCID: B6980358001502), covers the period 1971-12/79 and was prepared by a contractor on the basis of project reports. This project was a success and the national staff at the implementation and service levels in each country have continued project activities and are presently planning future developments. The following are some of the project activities now completed. In the Gambia, one pilot MCH demonstration center at Mansa Konko was set up and was replicated at Kuntaur and Kerewan.  A national MCH office also was developed within the Ministry of Health and a school for community health nurses was opened.  The first class of 15 students graduated from the Mansa Konko School for Community Health Nurses and have been assigned.  A second class of graduates are awaiting assignments.  In addition, 11 midwives/nurses were trained in Santa Cruz and 10 auxilary nurses were trained at Royal Victoria Hospital Family Planning Clinic. In Benin, MCH services were installed in 15 health centers. Each center was equipped with a trained nurse/midwife and required supplies. In addition, 15 FP clinics are in operation, one at each MCH center and one at the Cotonou National Center. Regular visits to the centers were made by the National MCH team and a plan for ongoing supervision of the centers was developed.  Forty-eight nurses and nurse/midwives received on-the-job training in FP at various MCH centers. Also, 21 nurse/midwives were trained at Santa Cruz and seven midwives/nurses received in-country training. Approximately 500 paramedical health personnel attended orientation/installation seminars. Major recommendations include the following:  Rural health training should be emphasized and should occur in a rural setting. Health personnel should be polyvalent, and a procedures manual related to planning, administration, and project activity is needed. Vehicles using available parts and in-country service facilities should be used.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1971-31 Dec1979","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID/afr-C-1295","","2/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Indigenous education|FAMILY PLANNING|Maternal child health care|Paramedical education|Nurse midwives|Health outreach services|Family health care|Clinics|Rural areas|Health care|Health workers|Family planning services|Delivery systems|Family planning occupations|Medical education|Participants|On the job training|Nurses|Nursing education","Gambia|Benin","","","000320 - University of California, Berkeley","","","English","","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation","","FRANKS, JAMES A.|MINNIS, ROBERT L.|WILSON, PAUL E.","","29 Feb 1980","","","","MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH/FAMILY PLANNING PROJECT FOR THE REPUBLIC OF THE GAMBIA AND THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BENIN, WEST AFRICA","","PD-AAI-394-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3Mzc2","Africa Regional","6980358"
"Evaluates project to enhance the capabilities of 20 Central and West African countries to plan and manage health delivery systems.  Special evaluation covers 9/77-4/80. The project is on track and administration by WHO/AFRO has been satisfactory.  In the disease surveillance and health information systems SP, epidemiologists assigned to The Gambia, Upper Volta, and Cameroon are developing disease surveillance systems for these and surrounding countries and have been assisted by operations officers and PCV's responsible for immunization demonstrations. Baseline data on morbidity and mortality from neonatal tetanus, polio, and measles were collected in the same 3 countries.  Full implementation of the expanded immunization programs is being hindered by an unreliable cold chain.  A heat stable vaccine, however, was developed and will be available in 1980.  Measles immunizations in Liberia and The Gambia were disrupted by late shipment of vaccine.  Two training courses for 83 national managers on expanded immunization programs have been held. In the Research and Evalution of Low Cost Delivery Systems SP, affordable health delivery systems have not been developed. Guidelines for applied research on health delivery and primary health care (PHC) were established, although research approval procedures have not yet been determined.  Proposals were made for a cost-benefit study of the Ivory Coast's immunization program and for a regional purchasing, storage, and distribution system for medical supplies. In the health planning and management (HPM) SP, programming courses for senior health administrators were held at the Dakar HPM center, whose future role will be discussed at the Arusha Conference.  A course was designed for mid-level planners, and a top-level management interministerial workshop was developed for planners from nine countries.  A health plan for Liberia based on a country health programming exercise was devised. Under the nursing and village health worker (VHW) training SP, a post-basic nursing center is being developed at Liberia's Cuttington College (CC).  A curriculum workshop was held for persons from Sierre Leone, Liberia, and The Gambia. CC faculty are concerned that introducing PHC training (the need for which among field workers they consider doubtful) may prolong the B.S. program and that the possible lack of qualified students may delay implementation at the country level.  Three CC faculty are studying advanced nursing education in the U.S., although none are from The Gambia or Sierre Leone.  Post-basic nursing curricula are being revised in both Dakar's and Yaounde's Centres d'Enseignment Superior en Soins Infirmiere programs. At the Lome Regional Training Center for VHW Trainers, a training manual adaptable by students to in-country use was developed.  VHW training was also begun in Lagos.","Evaluation period: 1 Sep 1977-30 Apr 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/SOD/PDC-C-0160","","5/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Health care planning|Health policy|Health care administration","Central Africa|West Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAH460A1.pdf","1,219 KB","009024 - Dimpex Associates, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Multi country evaluation|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation|Interim evaluation","","","","1 May 1980","","","","STRENGTHENING OF HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEMS IN CENTRAL AND WEST AFRICA, MIDTERM PROJECT EVALUATION","","PD-AAH-460-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3Mzk4","Africa Regional","6980398"
"Evaluates two projects (690008303 and 690003003) to train Swazis in the fields of health, agriculture, and education.  Special evaluation covers the period 11/77-8/80 and is based on questionnaires sent to trainees and interviews with Government of Swaziland (GOS) officials. By 3/80, 46 trainees had returned to Swaziland.  Of the 33 respondents to the questionnaire, only two had studied outside the United States.  Women accounted for 20% of the participants. Fifty-eight percent had received promotions.  Most felt that their training was quite relevant to the needs of their country, but not always to the departments to which they were assigned. Originally, USAID, the Department of Establishments and Training (DET), and GOS ministries worked together to select candidates. However, that procedure was dropped, with the DET making the selections.  In the future, A.I.D. should make arrangements with the DET to keep the ministries informed about A.I.D. training opportunities.  USAID should investigate training programs in other developing countries, particularly in Africa where training would be more applicable, trainees would have the opportunities to discuss common problems with developing country counterparts, and the cost would be less.  When U.S. training is provided, observation tours to other developing countries (in the summer or on the way home) should be considered.  More work/study programs are also recommended. Only 26% of the candidates received academic training; none received Ph.D. training.  Several GOS officials noted that most M.S. and B.S.-level participants are not qualified to train others. Thus, more Ph.D. candidates are needed to increase the multiplier effect.  Because USAID did not have university catalogs available, participants made their course selections in the United States without the benefit of consultation with their ministries. USAID should make a greater effort to provide such information.  Other recommendations include avoiding courses involving non-traditional formats unfamiliar to Swazis and reducing costs by conducting some courses in Swaziland.","Evaluation period: 1 Nov 1977-31 Aug 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Participants|Agricultural education|Agricultural management|Agricultural training|Education for development|Educational administration|Management training|Health professional education|Institution building|Beneficiary interviews","Swaziland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI398A1.pdf","924 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Final EOPS|Onsite evaluation","","NKAMBULE, SIPHO P.","Participant training","31 Aug 1980","","","","EVALUATION REPORT OF GOVERNMENT OF SWAZILAND/USAID PARTICIPANT TRAINING PROGRAMMES : SOUTHERN AFRICA DEVELOPMENT PERSONNEL AND TRAINING AND SOUTHERN AFRICA ACADEMIC AND SKILLS TRAINING","","PD-AAI-398-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3NDEw","Southern Africa Regional","690008303|690003003"
"Evaluates project to assist the Government of Costa Rica (GOCR) to use remote sensing (RS) techniques for mapping natural resources and monitoring urban expansion.  This special evaluation covers the period 1/78-8/79 and is based on a review of documents and interviews with USAID and GOCR project personnel and user agencies. The evaluators were impressed by the detail and comprehensiveness of the work performed, especially as to the extensive documentation available for review.  The team's main conclusions are given in the attached PES (PD-AAF-924-F1). Although the project demonstrated the utility of RS data and techniques for Costa Rica, the team disagrees with several of the conclusions and recommendations of the implementing agency, Research Development Associates (RDA). Specific findings were:  (1) The degree of RS utility and the exact GOCR needs for RS data have not been thoroughly investigated.  (2) Digital analysis of LANDSAT data is currently infeasible in Costa Rica, nor has the utility of such data to operational programs such as the natural resource inventory been demonstrated.  (3) The Instituto Geografico Nacional (IGN) should be given a clear administrative mandate for this inventory, and should set up an office to disseminate RS data to other GOCR agencies and a wide variety of public and private users. (4) The scope and use of resource information need to be more precisely determined before a geo-based information system can be created.  (5) The recommended RS training for resource managers and data users should be carried out by Costa Rican professionals.  Additional RS research should be directed to local needs. (6) The need for costly color products and the cost of building a color facility should be determined. Only black and white photography should be used until color data can be processed in-country.  (7) Close ties should be developed with the international RS community.  (8) A.I.D. should continue to support the application of U.S. RS technology in Costa Rica by providing funds to continue the training and inventory processes.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1978-31 Aug1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/LAC-C-1322","","2/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","REMOTE SENSING|Technical training|Institution building|URBAN PLANNING|Natural resource inventories|Technology transfer|Pilot projects|MAPS|Data collection|Data analysis|Satellites|Aerial photography|Technicians|Information dissemination|Beneficiary interviews","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI303B1.pdf","933 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation","","MORAIN, STANLEY|WAGNER, THOMAS","","1 Feb 1980","","","","EVALUATION REPORT; COSTA RICA PILOT PROJECT FOR NATURAL RESOURCE INVENTORY AND INFORMATION SYSTEM (MORAIN/WAGNER REPORT)","","PD-AAI-303-B1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3NDMx","Costa Rica","5150144"
"Evaluates project to improve the institutional capacity of the Ghana Rural Reconstruction Movement (GhRRM), a PVO, to conduct a self-help program of integrated rural development in the Mampong Valley in Ghana. This final evalution, which is attached to a PES facesheet (PD-AAI-395-D1), covers the period 7/1/76-9/30/80 and was based on a review of project documents, site visits, and interviews with project personnel and beneficiaries. Project impact analysis showed that, starting in 1977, the progress of educational, off-farm production, and agricultural technical assistance efforts declined significantly.  The literacy education activity is inoperative.  Demonstration projects at GhRRM's center, e.g., rabbitry, were abandoned, as was the construction of additions to the center. Few farmers showed improved agricultural techniques, while those with increased farm or livestock productivity did not credit GhRRM for their success. The health component has been the most continually successful activity, mainly due to the nurses and drugs provided by the Ministry of Health.  The civic responsiblity component's success is not due solely to GhRRM, but also to area traditions -- just as a worsening national economy, not GhRRM alone, has contributed to cooperative development. Project shortfalls are due to management and personnel problems. GhRRM's Board of Trustees has not given enough management or financial responsibility to the field director.  It is recommended that the Board take an advisory rather than directive role in project affairs, delegating daily supervision to the logistic support and the field and financial management committees. High-turnover, low morale, technical incompetence, and continual vacancies are a few of GhRRM's staff problems.  Staff salaries and conditions should be reviewed to attract and keep qualified personnel.  It is also recommended that: GhRRM seek help from government extension agents active nearby in similar efforts; program research focus on solving implementation problems; GhRRM's disbursement process be reviewed; and the current vehicle be replaced by one with four-wheel-drive.","Evaluation period: 1 Jul 1976-30 Sep 1980|Attachment: PD-AAI-395-D1","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Rabbits|Regional development|Development organizations|Agricultural production|Agricultural technology|Livestock|Animal husbandry|Professionals|Farmer training|Private voluntary organizations|Rural areas|Health care|Integrated rural development|Civic education|Literacy instruction|Agricultural development|Agricultural education|Beneficiary interviews","Ghana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI395A1.pdf","2,095 KB","008547 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve A.I.D. and LDC capability to apply science and technology (S&T) to development problems.  Evaluation, which is attached to PES (PD-AAK-005-A1), covers the period 8/77-7/80 and is based on interviews with project personnel and a document review. The implementing agency, the Board on Science and Technology for International Development (BOSTID)/National Academy of Sciences (NAS), provided relevant, high quality services.  Ten country workshops were held on topics such as energy development and food conservation; two more are planned.  Also, nine seminars were conducted in Washington, D.C. to discuss LDC urban problems, techniques for revegetation, and other issues.  NAS's Advisory Committee on Technology Innovation (ACTI) completed 11 studies, including reports on energy for rural development. To promote S&T development, NAS/BOSTID programs should address broader purposes, and A.I.D. should develop an agency-wide program to encourage greater use of BOSTID's capabilities.  Some specific suggestions are:  (1) BOSTID should be expanded to have a larger staff, more frequent Board meetings, and a suitable executive committee structure.  (2) An improved financial management system is needed to tie project costs to functions and outputs.  (3) NAS/BOSTID needs a formal system to identify and attract S&T experts.  (4) Greater use should be made of NAS/BOSTID's new evaluation system.  (5) NAS overseas grant and contracts management procedures should be carefully scrutinized.  (6) The production and review of ACTI reports should be expedited.  (7) A.I.D. should increase awareness of NAS capabilities among its senior staff, regional bureaus, etc.  (8) The design of new projects should be more realistic, and the project paper should be compatible with the contract agreement between A.I.D. and NAS. (9) A.I.D. should more closely cooperate with NAS in planning/implementing projects. (10) To promote more rapid introduction of technological improvements, Missions should make complementary grants, and NAS should provide seed grants to non-A.I.D. nations as well as to a communications institution.","Evaluation period: 1 Aug 1977-31 Jul 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Science|Technology|Workshops|Alternative energy resources|Appropriate technology|Problem solving|Seminars|ENERGY|Rural development|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAK005B1.pdf","4,664 KB","000080 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to identify cost-effective means of implanting vegetative and mechanical (rock) structures to protect and stabilize Kori bank gardens in Niger.  This special evaluation covers the period 3/1/77-6/1/80 and is based upon onsite visits and interviews.  It is attached to PES 6930410071501.  This project is part of the Accelerated Impact Program 698041000, formerly under Mission project 683022100. Detailed implementation/construction recommendations were not drafted by the French Bureau for Overseas Scientific & Technical Research (ORTSTROM).  Although this evaluation lacks detail, it constitutes the only formal recommendations available for designing future projects. Approximately 1,000 meters (m) of sloped and planted embankment, 630 m of dumped rock, 1,135 m of fitted rock work, 1,765 m of dry rock work, and 1020 m of rock filled gabion work (wire cages filled with rocks) were implanted.  Lengths of rock work and gabion surpassed project objectives, while other barriers were below planned levels.  The vegetative covering did not provide adequate erosion control and required close supervision.  Gabion structures proved too expensive and negated local replicability.  Fitted rock work provided the best control in relation to cost. Ten individuals received on-the-job training (masonry, etc.).  This total exceeded project expectations.  In addition, up to 105 individuals at one time received experience in semi-skilled erosion control (EC) construction. ORTSTROM conducted hydrological studies spanning three rainy seasons. The 1977 season produced water flows in excess of 300m3/sec. In 1978 and 1979 rains produced minor flows.  These studies did not concentrate on the basin's groundwater recharge, although the data will be useful when designing long-term enviromental development. Although controls need testing against severe flooding, the project purpose has been achieved. Conclusions state that:  (1) erosion is a major gardening constraint; (2) EC projects are expensive to implement and should be coupled with extension and cooperative development; (3) more area data on groundwater flows, etc., are needed.","Attached to PD-AAN-842|French ed.: PD-AAY-825|Evaluation period: 1 Mar 1977-1 Jun 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Hydrological surveys|Soil erosion|Rain|Indigenous education|Private voluntary organizations|Community participation","Niger","","","008585 - USAID.

"Evaluates projects (East Ghor Canal - 0175; Zarqa Irrigation - 0179; Village Development - 0183, 0205, 0221; Sprinkler Irrigation - 0195; Yarmouk Road - 0176) to improve agricultural production and the quality of life in the Jordan Valley. Evaluation covers the period 2/1/73-8/31/80 and is based on interviews and site visits. Because it is too early to evaluate the full impact of the projects, the evaluators assessed broad areas of development -- planning, land distribution, land tenure, cultivation techniques, production, employment and income, distribution of services, public facilities, housing, quality of life, local government, the role of women, and socioeconomic needs.  The following recommendations are offered: (1) The East Jordan Valley Development Plan should be reworked to incorporate recent agricultural changes (diversion of irrigation water to industrial and municipal uses, drip irrigation, and cultivation under plastic covers).  (2) Land redistribution should be expedited.  (3) Tenants should be given access to credit and other inputs.  (4) A sprinkler irrigation/production package should be developed for vegetable crops and research and extension expanded. (5) Possible problems due to changes in cropping patterns should be examined and the agricultural information system improved.  (6) Farm budget studies should be conducted to gain better insight into trends in agricultural income. (7) The next Valley Development Plan should take into consideration that employment and population growth will most likely occur in the middle subarea of the valley.  (8) The operation of three large type ""A"" health centers should be given top priority.  (9) Government agencies should set rental policies/prices and allocate units to their employees. Public housing efforts should be accelerated and upgraded. (10) Efforts to improve access to public services such as education and potable water should be continued. (11) Assistance to local governments should be based on an analysis of their resources and priorities.  (12) Training should be instituted for women engaged in unpaid family work.","Evaluation period: 1 Feb 1973-31 Aug 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Delivery systems|Agricultural inputs|Agricultural extension|Agriculture|Information services|Agricultural technology|LAND REFORM|Cropping patterns|Low cost housing|CREDIT|EMPLOYMENT|Road construction|Municipal level|Public administration|Women in development","Jordan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAF657.pdf","10,306 KB","008564 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop water systems for rural communities (barangays) in the Philippines.  Evaluation, which consists of part two of a special evaluation (for part one, PD-AAI-290-A1), analyzes the project's approach, systems, and procedures. Areas to be improved are as follows:  (1) More community participation is needed regarding type of recipient organization, level of service, and construction inspection.  Training linkages with experienced agencies should be established, as well as mechanisms for loan repayment to the national government and for collecting amortization payments from Barangay Water System Cooperatives (BWSC) to provincial governments.  (2) Water information collection should be reduced and local government units required to develop integrated water implementation plans.  (3) On-the-job training should be given; a trainers' training course and a plan for Project Management Staff (PMS) staff development prepared; vacant PMS positions filled; and a trainers' manual including a more experiential and open approach and an evaluation scheme developed.  (4) BWSC's accounting plan should be simplified and budgeting, operations, and information systems manuals designed for BWSC use.  (5) The bond for construction contractors should be lowered and construction more closely supervised. Standardizing design criteria for all service levels is advised.  (6) Prompt submission by provincial governments of project status reports and establishment of a management information system are recommended. (7) PMS should supervise all technical assistance. Architecture and Engineering (A&E) assistance -- whose functions should perhaps be combined with USAID's engineering staff -- needs improvement as to site surveys, detailed estimates, and consultant selection.  (8) Creating a provincial planning committee representive of a wide spectrum of agencies should be considered. The authority to approve BWSC organization should be delegated to Ministry of Local Government and Community Development's regional director.  (9) A provincial financial program is needed to determine the maximum level of fund infusion.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1978-31 Dec1979|V. 1: PD-AAI-290-A1","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-492-1586-T","","3/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Water supply structures|Aqueducts|Water supply|Rural areas|Indigenous education|Management information systems|Water|Associations|Consumers|Community participation|Institution building|Professionals|Educational materials|Manuals and handbooks|Beneficiary interviews","Philippines","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/GetDoc.axd?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3NTI2&pID=NTYw&attchmnt=VHJ1ZQ==&uSesDM=False&rIdx=Mzk1MzU4","","001704 - Economic Development Foundation","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","","","1 Mar 1980","","","","Evaluation study : Barangay water project.

"Evaluates project to upgrade the institutional capability of the Government of Costa Rica (GOCR) to provide family planning (FP) services. This special contracted evaluation, attached to a PES (DOCID: B5150132001502), covers the period 1/77-7/80 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel. A.I.D. materials and contraceptives were timely and sufficient.  The goal of lowering fertility and crude birth rates was not achieved, however.  Progress was hindered by negative positions of the new (1978) GOCR administration on sterilization and FP and by the need to forego training of women health care specialists (WHCS) due to lack of professional endorsement.  Other training targets were met or surpassed, but FP-related activities were either abolished (midwives) or restricted (referral agents), or the FP content of the training was inadequate (auxiliary nurses and health assistants).  The Ministry of Health (MOH) established 122 of 125 targeted new Rural Health Clinics (RHP's), but FP consultations at these were insufficient -- only 2% of all FP consultations in 1979.  More than the targeted 967 FP courses were given and benefitted an estimated 53,600 persons, but the effectiveness of information, education, and communication (IE&C) activities, on which 44% of project funds were expended, could not be determined.  MOH's distribution system has several problems; in particular, two distributors cannot cover all 436 FP service centers. Contraceptive coverage could not be accurately determined due to inadequate and under-reported statistics of the Costa Rican Service Statistics System (SIDESCO). Given current GOCR FP policy, future goals should focus on reducing unwanted and adolescent pregancies, improving maternal and child health, and stressing IE&C activities that confront the native desire for three to four children.  Other recommendations include increasing cooperation with the Costa Rican Social Security Institute; evaluating IE&C activities; and developing an improved Mission reporting and monitoring system. Guidelines for future A.I.D. FP involvement in Costa Rica are included.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1977-31 Jul1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/CR P.O.# 090-80","","8/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Contraceptive distribution|Indigenous education|Sterilization (birth control)|Family planning services|Delivery systems|Institution building|Family planning clinics|MASS MEDIA|Family planning promotion programs|Family planning occupations|Medical education|Nurses|Paramedical education|Health workers|Assistants|Data collection|Data analysis|Maternal child health care|Evaluation methodology|National level|Government departments|Beneficiary count","Costa Rica","","","008533 - USAID.

"Evaluates project (revised, 1978) to establish a self-sustaining technology transfer program (PTT) between the United States and other developed countries and small- and medium-size Central American (CA) industries.  This final contracted evaluation, attached to a PES (PD-AAI-424-A1), covers the period 1/76-8/80 and is based on review of files and documents and numerous onsite interviews. A total of 315 industries (especially food industries), 222 institutions (especially those of governments), and 21 individuals were contacted by field representatives (FR's) from the implementing agency, the Central American Institute of Research and Industrial Technology (ICAITI).  PTT impact on small businesses was small, however, due to the latter's greater need for capital than for technology services and the high cost of ICAITI services.  (Even with these costs, ICAITI will have to increase its overhead rate from 80% to 100% to break even with the PTT program.)  U.S. technical support contractors benefitted the project greatly, especially by training FR's, but had no opportunity to perform the technology function designed for them -- a situation that should be remedied in Phase II. By establishing an ICAITI technology transfer system in all five CA countries, the project enabled ICAITI to expand vertically for the first time in its history, although this expansion is now being threatened by political unrest in the region.  ICAITI's ability to promote coordination with other institutions such as the Organization of American States was impressive. Despite these achievements, the original project concept--to disseminate hard-to-obtain technical knowledge to CA industries for a fee--remains largely untested.  Reasons for this include ICAITI's refusal to hire senior consulting engineers at originally budgeted salary levels; the project design's lack of professional specifications for FR's; lack of user receptivity to FR services; and lack of an information system determining PTT impact on end-users. Besides the latter, recommendations focus on decreasing project costs and stressing service to small enterprises.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1976-31 Aug1980","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-596-500-T","","8/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Technology transfer|Small scale enterprises|Institution building|Industrial development|Industrial technology|Technicians|Technical training|Development project evaluation|Impact assessment|Management information systems|Beneficiary interviews","Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI427A1.pdf","6,373 KB","001744 - GAMCO, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Multi country evaluation|Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Final EOPS|Onsite evaluation","","","","1 Aug 1980","","","","PROGRAM FOR TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY (PTT); FINAL EVALUATION REVIEW","","PD-AAI-427-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3NTMy","Reg Office Cent America & Panama (ROCAP)","5960066"
"Evaluates a joint United States/United Kingdom (UK) program to reduce Indian dependence on fertilizer imports by increasing local fertilizer production. Final evaluation is based on interviews with UK, Government of India (GOI), and contractor representatives and covers the period 7/1/71-7/31/75. The Indian Farmers' Fertilizer Cooperative (IFFCO), established by the program and possessing ammonia and urea plants in Kalal and a nitrogen/phosphate/potash (NPK) factory in Kandla, is, with 10% of the market, the largest fertilizer producer in India. The plants are highly utilized and, considering their technical environment, comparable to their North American counterparts.  Program success, aided by a highly trained IFFCO staff and assistance from Cooperative Farmers International, was sufficient to allow the GOI to independently establish an additional ammonia/urea plant in Phulpur. Urea plant operation is now satisfactory, but late equipment delivery delayed production 7 months and a poorly designed main compressor caused a 45-day loss of output.  The ammonia plant is working well and an improvement program now underway will further increase capacity. Although the NPK plant opened 4 months late due to an inadequate supply of phosphoric acid, current operation is good and a second NPK stream is now being installed. Cost overruns, the result of higher than anticipated overhead and inflation, were not alarming.  The GOI has set the prices of many inputs/outputs to attain a rate of profit of 12%, assuming operation at 80% of capacity.  Return on capital has been adequate except at the Kandla plant. It is recommended that the UK:  (1) evaluate large future projects to more clearly indicate the impact of its assistance; (2) conduct a study comparing the economic value of diammonium phosphate and potash versus NPK, since use of world prices for the former to analyze the value of the latter has underestimated the real benefits farmers derive from NPK; and (3) assess the future aid needs of a larger, better managed Indian fertilizer industry which is moving into an era of more massive and costly factories.","Evaluation period: 1 Jul 1971-31 Jul 1975","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","AMMONIA|UREA|Diammonium phosphate|NITROGEN|Phosphorus|Fertilizers|Agribusiness|Agricultural research|Agricultural inputs|Agrochemicals|Industrial development|Balance of trade|IMPORTS|Agricultural cooperatives","India","","","000919 - Overseas Development Council (ODC)","","","English","","Ex post evaluation|Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Final EOPS","","SNOWDON, F.

"Evaluates project to assess selected developing nations' demographic data. This special evaluation is attached to a PES (PD-AAK-022-B1) and covers the period 4/77-8/80.  Only the report's summary and conclusions are presented. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS), the project contractor, formed a 12-member Committee on Population and Demography (CPD) to implement the project.  CPD held 9 of the agreed 11 international workshops (with a tenth in Colombia planned for 9/80) to prepare 20 individual country reports, as well as a demographic estimation manual and a demographic data collection study.  CPD, however, has completed reports for only Korea, Thailand, and Honduras -- with one on Bangladesh in final draft form.  The project is so far behind schedule that it is doubtful whether most reports will be ready by the close of 1980 for NAS' final review.  The delay is due to CPD's unrealistic production estimate under the available time, a reliance upon unpaid panel members, and a cumbersome panel and review structure; CPD justified the latter in view of the workshop's educational function.  The delay is not due to CPD's lack of commitment. Considering its small size, CPD has been fairly efficient. The completed reports attest that sophisticated demographic estimates have not improved the state of knowledge, while the reports themselves add little to current knowledge about fertility trends in the nations examined. It is recommended that:  A.I.D. and NAS/CPD meet to prioritize incomplete reports in terms of nations' cost/benefit ratios (the evaluation team's leading choices are the reports on Brazil, Mexico, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Egypt); efficient means of finishing the reports be considered, e.g., subcontracting panel members; the contract period be extended for 6 months with more funding; reports possibly provide both ""probable range"" and ""best point"" estimates and be improved in organization; and there be more coordination among the country reports, estimation manual, and data collection study.  It is also recommended that NAS/CPD concentrate on its present projects rather than undertake new work.","Attached to PD-AAK-022|Evaluation period: 1 Apr 1977-31 Aug 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Demographic data collection|Research methodology|DEMOGRAPHY|Vital statistics|Vital statistics registration|Population and demography|Information storage and retrieval systems|Demographic research|Seminars|Data collection|Data analysis|Classrooms|Project change|Limited data","","","","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","","Evaluation team","","CARD, JOSEFINA J.|KIRK, DUDLEY|STOLNITZ, GEORGE J.","","10 Oct 1980","","","","EVALUATION OF PROJECT ON POPULATION DATA SYSTEMS","","XD-AAK-022-B1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3NTY1","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","9320649"
"Evaluates two A.I.D. projects (5380029 and 5380030) managed by the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) to increase infrastructure and employment in Dominica, Barbados, St. Vincent, Antigua, and St. Kitts. Evaluation covering 8/79-12/80 is attached to a PES facesheet (PD-AAI-463-A1) and is based on field trips and interviews with project personnel. School/road construction and employment-generation are satisfactory in St. Vincent, but afforestation and soil conservation programs appear to be of questionable merit and are poorly managed. The Government of Antigua is dismayed by equipment purchase regulations and the cost of expatriate consultants, has concentrated activities in populous areas, and has refused to design low-cost schools. A planned Government of St. Kitts overhaul of the economy should aid project efforts, but limited public works management expertise has caused delays and the use of project funds on government sugar farms has been questioned. In Dominica, lengthy delays have resulted from serious management problems and a shortage of building supplies. It is feared that, when construction begins in Barbados, unskilled labor may be in short supply due to the sugar cane harvest. Evaluator recommends the CDB:  (1) add two to its technical staff; (2) better communicate budgets and building specifications to contractors; (3) increase the role of community service officers, especially in maintenance programs; (4) increase project publicity; (5) make project supervisors aware of their role as project expeditors; (6) consider replacing the Dominica project supervisor; (7) reorganize agricultural programs in St. Vincent; (8) develop a monthly summary of fund allocation, employment, and implementation progress; (9) decrease classroom contruction costs by standardizing plans and reducting their number rather than their size; (10) simplify criteria for selecting sub-projects and provide faster approval for small sub-projects; (11) develop new projects to impact on the young; and (12) assist USAID in surveying the potential for agricultural/industrial diversification.","Evaluation period: 1 Aug 1979-31 Dec 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/SOD/PDC-0195","","1/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Educational facilities|EMPLOYMENT|Health facilities|Building renovation|Road construction|Nonformal education|Agricultural diversification|Development project design|Development project implementation|Development project evaluation|Labor intensive technology|Classrooms|Building construction|Youth|Vocational training|Beneficiary interviews","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI463B1.pdf","1,346 KB","002164 - Roy Littlejohn Associates, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Multi country evaluation|Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","","Educational development","1980","","","","EVALUATIVE REPORT : FIRST YEAR OF BASIC HUMAN NEEDS (BHN) AND CARIBBEAN EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (CED)","","PD-AAI-463-B1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3NTc2","Caribbean Regional","5380029|5380030"
"Evaluates project to create a Regional Remote Sensing Facility in East Africa to monitor environmental changes having development policy implications. This special evaluation, attached to a PES (PD-AAI-475-A1), covers the period 1/79-3/80 and is based on site visits and interviews with representatives of the Governments of Kenya, Botswana, and Tanzania. Four of eight targets have been attained:  training programs are underway; a report of short courses has been published; newsletters are being distributed; and remote sensing is being used by several East African states.  Regarding the other four goals: a browse file and library are still being developed; the photolab is nonoperational; no African counterpart staff has been hired; and only a few demonstration projects have been undertaken.  Because of these shortfalls, outputs for the 1981 evaluation should be revised, with emphasis on hiring four qualified counterparts (especially one for the Facility Director) and augmenting user services by completing the browse file (with added funding for new NASA imagery).  Also recommended are completion of the photolab, with specialized training for photolab technicians; elimination of a photo-enhancing device and the Doppler Positioning system and other surveying items; use of existing A.I.D. projects for demonstration projects; and postponement of LANDSAT-D courses, the regional symposium, and a change in the Facility's location. An aggressive campaign by the Facility, the Regional Economic Development Services Office (REDSO), and the Regional Mapping Centre (RMC) to locate new African and non-regional donors is strongly urged. Also recommended are timely Facility reports to REDSO; REDSO/Facility discussions on specific budget outlays; and regular planning and budgeting meetings. Because of the project's serious financial straits, a 2-year extension with increased funding is recommended with the parallel recommendations that the Facility remain an adjunct of the RMC and that Facility operating costs and trainee travel expenses be progressively shifted to RMC and individual African countries respectively.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1979-31 Mar1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Indigenous education|Educational facilities|Technicians|Technical training|Scientific information|Technical information|Information dissemination|Science education|Remote sensing|Regional development|Educational centers|Development planning|Libraries|Natural resource inventories","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI475B1.pdf","1,146 KB","000013 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to expand rural primary health care (RPHC) in Thailand. Evaluation covers the period 10/1/78-03/21/80 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project officials. RPHC has shown impressive gains reflected in declining population growth, reduced infant and maternal mortality, and increased immunization. Considering the enormity of the effort and the logistical/administrative difficulties involved in training a targeted 94,181 RPHS personnel, the training of 56,410 people in 10 categories is impressive.  However, the training of only 321 of 900 nurse practitioners has been a disappointment. Because key management personnel -- provincial chief medical officers and section chiefs -- have received little training and only 120 of a planned 528 managers at all levels have been trained, RPHC management has been impaired. Evaluation and research has been slowed by delays in hiring consultants, the Government of Thailand's (GOT) reluctance to finance research, USAID's decision to deny honoraria to Ministry of Public Health staff; and the GOT/Health Planning Division's (HPD) inability to handle a heavier workload.  Of nine planned research studies, only three, relating to RPHC training effectiveness and community health conditions, have been conducted. It is recommended that:  (1) USAID coordinate RPHC with community development activities; (2) the project's training methodology be researched; (3) refresher courses in curative care, information/education/communication, community development, and drug use be established; (4) problem-solving sessions be incorporated into management training; (5) data management/information flow receive added emphasis; (6) additional researchers be hired; (7) HPD continue efforts to upgrade and design effective mechanisms for coordinating and using research and evaluation; (8) methods of evaluating the health delivery system be developed; (9) strategies to develop a comprehensive approach to primary health care be explored; and (10) the quality of curative care be more closely monitored.","Evaluation period: 1 Oct 1978-21 Mar 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","1/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Health care|Health delivery|Operations research|Health outreach services|Medical education|Health care administration|Indigenous education|Participants|Family planning occupations|Health workers|Primary health care|Nurse practitioners|Nursing education|Management training|Immunizations|Infant mortality|Beneficiary count","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAF579.pdf","1,145 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation|Interim evaluation","","STEWART, MICHAEL M.|BROWNLEE, ANN|FREYDIG, CONSTANCE A.","","1980","","LTR.

"Evaluates project to fund low-income housing through the Government of Portugal's (GOP) Fundo de Fomento de Habitacao (FFH).  Special evaluation covers the period 1/75-12/79 and is based on site visits and interviews with FFH and USAID officials. By funding construction of housing for 3,178 families and stabilizing the shelter sector, the project has contributed to the GOP's goal of providing decent housing to low-income families.  The first housing guaranty (HG) was initiated in 1975 to fund four (expanded to 14) large, mostly urban, subsidized rental projects.  Difficulty was encountered due to rising costs and weaknesses in the public housing planning and delivery systems.  Contractor bankruptcy left 1,068 units incomplete, inadequate infrastructure affected 250 units, and legal impediments to land expropriation of land delayed 38 units.  As a result, FFH exhausted all A.I.D. and GOP funds and is unable to complete all projects. The only concrete result of the technical assistance (TA) component was the well-received 1979 Housing Finance Seminar. After a crisis in the construction sector and an influx of 700,000 refugees from Angola and Mozambique, a second HG was provided in l976 to fund 57 cooperative, municipal housing authority, and owner's association self-help (SAAL) projects -- a total of 4,753 units.  The greater number and variety of projects created added problems, and by late 1979 only 2,694 units were finished and 1,446 occupied. It is recommended that the GOP and/or FFH:  (1) give high priority to completing unfinished projects; (2) continue to reform and reorganize the housing delivery system; (3) develop master plans and organize and train staff to meet local needs; (4) review unit size and quality standards to increase projects' cost-effectiveness; (5) incorporate clandestine housing settlements into the national housing system; (6) reevaluate property maintenance and repair; (7) consider reviving abandoned SAAL projects; (8) revitalize the development contract program; and (9) establish a special fund to acquire land suitable for housing projects.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1975-16 Dec 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Low cost housing|Housing investment guaranty|Urban areas|Housing|Housing cooperatives|Urban planning|Government policy|Urban population growth|Beneficiary count|Limited data plus","Portugal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAH482.pdf","1,874 KB","000983 - Richard T.

"Evaluates project to provide financial support to 30 Medium Irrigation Projects (MIP) in Gujarat, India.  Evaluation is attached to a PES facesheet (PD-AAG-859), covers the period 8/78-10/80, and is based on site visits, financial and socioeconomic studies, and surveying reports. Although 30 MIP's covering 149,000 ha of irrigated land were originally planned, it is expected that 23 new and 7 improved MIP's covering 257,000 ha will be completed.  River gauging stations have been installed and the necessary has been received at 23 MIP's, socioeconomic studies are complete for 24 MIP's, and canal seepage measurements have been initiated in several areas. Progress on eight of the 14 currently approved MIP's is 12-18% behind schedule.  In addition, staffs at MIP sites have not been increased, threatening shortages of materials.  Quality control in canal lining, particularly at the Panam and Watrak sites, has been lax. Communication between the Government of Gujarat State's (GOG) Ministry of Irrigation (MOI) and Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) has impeded compliance with agricultural criteria.  Communication between Irrigation Department and the Central Water Commission's appraisal committee has delayed the start of the remaining 12 projects. Inaccurate maps and a lack of layout procedures have delayed the planning and designing of minor distribution networks. It is recommended that:  (1) the GOG take immediate action to assure necessary staff are in place at each MIP in the next few months; (2) MOA and MOI improve cooperation to ensure that the required agricultural development plans and demonstration projects are established at each MIP; (3) GOG conduct workshops for all Assistant and Junior Engineers involved in canal lining, form a task force to carry out detailed inspections of linings, and discontinue use of the compressed sand-cement tiles currently being used for canal lining; (4) the appraisal committee and the Irrigation Department better communicate in order to expedite action on 12 MIP's; and (5) sign boards be installed at each MIP site to indicate USAID assistance.","Attached to PD-AAG-859|Evaluation period: 1 Aug 1978-1 Nov 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","IRRIGATION|Surface irrigation|Canals|Pilot projects|Water supply structures|Irrigated farming|Sociology research|Economic research|Limited data","India","","","008557 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to promote science and technology development in Tunisia. Special evaluation covers the period 1/1/77-12/5/80 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with USAID and GOT officials. GOT and A.I.D. actions caused delays during both the first 2 years and the ensuing 2-year extension of Phase I. The systems analysis/operations research subproject (SP) began with placement of four advisors in the Office of the Prime Minister, but 2 years later the GOT decided it lacked the means to continue and cancelled the SP. By the time AID/W contracted services for the computer technology SP, the nature of the assistance needed by the Centre National de l'Information had changed. A revised strategy in line with these new needs has been developed and will require no further technical assistance. The U.S. Geological Survey successfully implemented the remote sensing SP -- a laboratory was installed, production capacity was upgraded, and participants were trained. Under the petroleum technology SP, 11 Entreprise Tunisienne d'Activites Petrolieres (ETAP) engineers received short-term, U.S. training and 2 others are working toward M.S. degrees.  ETAP cited scheduling of training as a problem and prefers to work directly with U.S. universities. The pollution research SP was seriously hampered because U.S.-trained Tunisians were not assigned to the GOT's Gabes and Central Laboratories. The GOT in turn questioned the competence of U.S. advisors. Before continuing with Phase II, it is recommended that:  (1) GOT responsibility for coordinating subprojects with science and technology development goals be designated to avoid future duplication of effort; (2) A.I.D. consider limiting assistance to the petroleum technology SP since it has largely achieved its objectives; (3) A.I.D. conclude the computer technology and remote sensing SP's; (4) A.I.D. emphasize its role as mediator and financial controller and eliminate its operational role as much as possible; (5) the GOT work more directly with consultants and contractors in implementing SP's; and (6) U.S. training be considered favorably in future SP's.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1977-5 Dec1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","664-0300-C-00-1006-00","","12/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Science education|Technicians|Technology transfer|Graduate education|Energy|Management training|Computers|Technical training|REMOTE SENSING|Pollution|Environmental protection|Management|Problem solving|Petroleum|Energy resource development|Beneficiary count","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR944.pdf","3,441 KB","008616 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to create a capability at Cairo University (CU) to conduct, in cooperation with Eygptian ministry personnel, applied research relevant to development goals.  Special evaluation covers the period 12/76-2/80 and is based in part on interviews with personnel from Egyptian ministries, CU, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the contractor. The project has achieved most of its objectives.  Fourteen collaborative research projects have been developed by MIT faculty, their CU counterparts, and various ministries, focusing on: (1) energy: a project to provide personnel capable of long-term investment planning for the electric power system; (2) manufacturing: projects to strengthen engineering technology and to analyze the effect of government policy on small private industry; (3) public works:  recommendations and guidelines for public agencies concerned with housing; identification of housing problems; studies of urban and intercity transportation and of groundwater reservoirs; development of water planning models and a model for operating the Aswan Dam; programs in crop irrigation and agriculture drainage planning; and (4) socioeconomic development:  projects in rural communications, labor migration and manpower planning, health delivery systems, and improved sectoral and macroeconomic planning. The research projects have had an impact upon larger programs underway in Egypt and many recommendations have already been implemented. Through these research efforts, and through workshops, conferences, seminars, and extensive publications, the project has increased awareness of the value of cooperation between ministry and academic personnel, upgraded the technical quality of CU faculty, established solid professional relationships between MIT and CU faculty, and developed a nucleus of people who can contribute to the resolution of development problems.  Progress has also been made toward institutionalizing a framework for exposing decisionmakers to research in project/program evaluation.  A Development Research and Technological Planning Center has been established at CU to solve developmental problems, support technological development, and provide a capability for rapid retrieval of essential data.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/ne-C-1291","","2/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Universities and colleges|Faculty|Development project evaluation|Technical training|Evaluation methodology","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM411.pdf","8,395 KB","008539 - USAID.

"Evaluates P.L. 480 Title III Basic Village Service (BVS) project to strengthen the capacity of local Egyptian governments to support rural development.  Special evaluation covers the period 3/79-2/80 and is based on document review, site visits, and discussions with project and participating bank officials. The project has progressed according to schedule (i.e., better than normal in projects of this type), although some objectives, particularly those regarding coordination among Egyptian agencies and popular participation in local projects, are so broadly defined that full achievement is not possible.  Funds from sales of P.L. 480 grain have been distributed to governorates and villages in a timely manner. In 1/80 work began on 235 projects for 365 villages in 3 governorates. In Fayoum Governorate, canal lining is proceeding well and road improvement projects have begun.  Water, sanitation, and biogas projects will start shortly in Fayoum, where all projects are expected to be completed on schedule.  Sharkia and Sohag Governorates are limiting themselves to potable water and road projects. The local projects are oriented toward social development as opposed to increased production, but water, sanitation, and road projects will have indirect but positive effects upon human productivity.  For traditional projects, design, financial management, construction, and audit services have been adequate; there may be special design problems with more technical projects, e.g., those involving irrigation control or erosion.  The Organization for Reconstruction and Development of the Egyptian Village (ORDEV) has implemented the project satisfactorily, but reporting has been slow. Recommendations are to:  (1) continue the project and expand activities to 8 more governorates as planned; (2) strengthen village and governorate-level implementation capabilities through an evaluation and training program; (3) require more rigorous analysis of projected benefits and distribution of benefits before approving local projects; (4) select a random subset of projects for intense cost-benefit analysis; (5) develop baseline data on the presence of potable water, roads, canal lining, etc.; (6) include more production-oriented projects; and (7) determine whether additional funds could be used next year, and if so, how.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Decentralization|Rural development|Development project design|Development project implementation|Development project evaluation|Community development","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM437.pdf","2,037 KB","008539 - USAID.

"Evaluates the credit program of the Financial Institution for Development and Cooperation (FICOOP), a financial institution (established 6/77) wholly owned by the Dominican Republic's cooperative movement and providing funding for its development. The existence of FICOOP has enabled cooperatives and their members throughout the Dominican Republic to obtain credit at favorable rates. For many who have received credit, FICOOP was the only possible source of funds.  Via lines of credit with the Central Bank, FICOOP obtains funds at rates from 3.5% to 7.5%; member cooperatives and individual borrowers receive funds at slightly higher rates.  These funds, as well as FICOOP's capital and reserve funds, are made available to agriculture, livestock and poultry, mining and transportation, or other production-related services.  Most loans have as their objective improving the nutrition of the Dominican people.  Loan requests originate at the level of the final user; only well-founded projects are eligible.  The Executive Director of FICOOP may approve loans of less than $15,000; this procedure expedites disbursements and thus production.  Larger loans require FICOOP board approval. In 6/79, FICOOP signed an agreement with the Secretary of Agriculture (SEA) setting up a $250,000 revolving loan fund as part of the Program for the Small Farmer, which was established by an agreement between A.I.D. and the SEA under project 5170100. Under this agreement, FICOOP has processed 5 loans benefiting 284 small farmers, and totaling just under $100,000. As of 1/31/80, FICOOP loans totaled 4 million pesos; 4,000 families have benefited directly and 22,000 indirectly.  Additional loans to cooperative federations for warehouse construction have the potential to benefit another 30,000 families.  Continued growth in FICOOP lending can be expected as FICOOP enjoys considerable unused borrowing capacity within the Central Bank. Several recommendations are made regarding FICOOP's lending and collection procedures.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Cooperatives|Financing|Financial institutions|Credit|Agricultural credit","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM510.pdf","2,127 KB","","","002727 - Inter-American Foundation|002729 - Dominican Republic.

"Evaluates project to assist PROFAM, a private Mexican organization, to market contraceptives in Mexico.  Special evaluation covers the period 11/78-3/80 and is based on document review, interviews with implementing, Government of Mexico, and pharmacy personnel, and site visits. Although the contraceptive sales program has not yet gained self-sufficiency or met its goal of 7%-10% coverage of fertile-age couples at a cost of $3.00 per couple-year of protection (CYP), excellent progress has been made in establishing the program nationwide. Public awareness and use of contraceptives was increased during 1979 through over 234,000 radio advertisements on 95 stations and magazine and newspaper advertisements; the distribution of 3.4 million informative pamphlets, 12,000 copies of a retailer manual, several thousand copies of five other publications on family planning (FP) and PROFAM products, 29,000 posters, and thousands of sample contraceptives; and 4,846 educational presentations to 25,810 persons. Market research in consumer attitudes toward FP in general and toward PROFAM products has been conducted and applied toward project management; a quantitative analysis of FP habits is being tested. PROFAM educators and retailers were trained in FP and PROFAM product promotion. Displays and availability of low-cost condoms, suppositories, foams, creams, and pills in 9,300 drugstores (of 17,000 targeted outlets) has provided 108,000 CYP at $15-$25/CYP. PROFAM has, in fact, established such capabilities in management, operations, and information that it may be overly sophisticated in view of its current and projected sales volume.  The project's success to date, however, has been achieved at a substantial start-up cost. For this investment to be worthwhile, sales must be increased substantially and product cost per unit of sale reduced. Recommendations include increasing mass media and point-of-sale advertising, expanding sales to semi-urban communities with a greater diversity of retail outlets, consolidating product lines before launching new products, continuing market and consumer research, seeking additional external support, and extending the project for 2 years.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","3/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning occupations|Medical education|Family planning services|Delivery systems|Family planning education|Educational materials|Commercial retail sale of contraceptives|Technical assistance|Beneficiary count","Mexico","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM550.pdf","3,721 KB","001318 - American Public Health Association.

"Provides ex post facto evaluation of a subproject (of the Private and Voluntary Organizations Project) to conduct a model nutrition education (NE) program in Wonseong County, Korea.  Evaluation was prepared by a special subproject committee and covers the period 1978-80. Project educational activities included direct education of housewives and members of the Civil Defense Forces; education of social and health workers, teachers, and civil servants in charge of rural development; and development of 20 types of educational aids and of model primary schools for nutrition improvement.  In addition, radio programs were conducted and Nutrition Improvement Clubs organized.  At a Nutrition Demonstration School, 247 children and seven teachers attended an intensive NE program.  Efforts were made to raise government awareness of nutrition needs through meetings of the Advisory Committee, a workshop, and a seminar. A comparison of the model county with the control county after 3 years showed improvement in knowledge and attitude toward nutrition among the people of the model county, as well as strengthened cooperation by local government offices and the central government. Housewives and primary school children in the model county had more correct ideas of proper nutrition than their counterparts in the control county, and the intake of protein and preparation and storage of food was better in the model county, where housewives provided more nutritive supplementary food for their children than their control counterparts. Variety in foods, as well as per capita daily average intake, were increased, with a marked improvement in the intake of dairy products, vegetables, and fruits by preschool children and pregnant and lactating women.  Little difference between the two counties was noted, however, in regard to washing hands before meals and boiling water to drink or in regard to overall health status; considerable time will be needed to effect the latter. A 2-year project extension and development of a similar project in southern Korea are recommended.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID/pha-G-1104","","9/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Nutrition education|Pilot projects|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews|Project change|Sampling method","Korea R","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM542.pdf","3,766 KB","001995 - Meals for Millions/Freedom from Hunger Foundation","","008566 - USAID.

"Evaluates P.L. 480 Title II Food for Peace (FFP) Program.  Special evaluation (dated 10/80) consists of documents covering:  the economic and social welfare aspects of food aid; A.I.D. policies and practices; A.I.D. evaluation methods; and the Catholic Relief Services (CRS) FFP program in Kenya.  No methodology is mentioned. The first document identifies economic and social welfare issues that should regulate international food aid, concluding that reference to these principles has been lacking in A.I.D. evaluations of Title II country programs.  Food aid for nutritionally vulnerable groups, school children, welfare institutions, and famine victims is discussed; the limitations of the Food for Work (FFW) concept are described; and the real costs of food aid are considered.  It is suggested that of all recipient groups, poor households can be most developmentally affected; suggestions are made for expanding developmental food aid. The second document critically reviews A.I.D. policies and practices regulating the programs of the sponsors and distributors of Title II foods.  It is suggested that the A.I.D. policy stipulating that food supplements be consumed only by the targeted household member is unrealistic, for families will always share food.  Further, the developmental role of food aid is highly questionable; unless A.I.D. provides adequate funding as well as commodities, it cannot expect sponsors and distributors to use Title II resources for developmental goals. The third document briefly reviews external evaluations of Title II programs, showing that because A.I.D. policies and regulations are based on erroneous assumptions, evaluations are similarly flawed.  In addition, evaluators often fail to understand the goals of food aid and the role of the sponsor.  The final document provides a response to a 7/80 special evaluation of the CRS FFP program in Kenya. Attention is directed to the evaluator's poor sample selection and misunderstandings regarding maternal/child health and FFW programs; it is concluded that the evaluator's misinterpretations of CRS and local distributors' policies and activities, reflect, again, a failure to analyze the principles of food aid beyond the limits of A.I.D. policies and regulations.  Appended are a review of CRS sub-Saharan programs and related documents.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title II|Development strategies|Development program evaluation|Voluntary organizations|Limited data","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAM691.pdf","2,219 KB","007337 - Catholic Relief Services (CRS)","","","English","application/pdf","Multi country evaluation","","","Food aid programs","Oct 1980","","","","Whither Title II : a contribution to food for peace, PL-480 Title II; evaluation","","PN-AAM-691","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc4MTgx","Kenya",""
"Evaluates project to help International Human Assistance Programs, Inc. (IHAP), a U.S. PVO, institutionalize a system of program planning, development, and evaluation.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/77-9/80 and is based on document review, interviews with IHAP, USAID, and counterpart staff and with beneficiaries, and site visits in Korea, Philippines, and Thailand. The Development Program Grant, which was extended from 9/30/80 to 2/18/81, has helped IHAP expand its activities from 2 to 12 countries and from 20 to 35 major projects and expand its finances from $2.4 million to $4 million.  As per grant objectives, a program department has been established in IHAP and three of four positions have been filled, although with some confusion concerning administrative, management, and evaluation duties.  Staff training has been minimal, however, with little U.S. training or orientation for U.S.-based staff and even less for field staff.  Little applied research has been conducted. IHAP projects, the emphasis of which has shifted under the grant from welfare to community-based integrated rural development projects, are low-cost, of limited duration, have achievable goals, and emphasize self-help, stringent managerial controls, and the heavy involvement of beneficaries to assure the continuation of development activities beyond project life.  IHAP functions as facilitator or implementor, providing seed money and technical assistance in planning and management, according to the needs of each individual project. Projects in community development, health, agriculture, and women in development stress the generation of family income, skills training, and the strengthening of local institutions to support technical programs. Targets are based on expressed needs of the community and means for achieving them are usually specified in project designs. On the other hand, assessment of economic costs and returns is weak and IHAP guidelines for evaluating its projects need further development. In sum, IHAP has demonstrated effectiveness and integrity and is clearly capable of implementing a matching grant.","Evaluation period: Sep 1977-Sep 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/SOD-147-0441","","10/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Institution building|Development project design|Development project implementation|Development project evaluation|Beneficiary interviews","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM606.pdf","2,396 KB","001370 - International Human Assistance Programs, Inc.","","000145 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to test a model for improving agricultural and rural development planning and management in the Government of Nepal (GON).  Final evaluation, prepared by an outside consultant, covers the period 8/77-9/79 and is based on document review, visits to project training sessions, and interviews with project personnel and senior-level GON agricultural managers. As planned, a Training Division was established in the GON's Agricultural Projects Service Centre (APROSC) to implement the project. U.S. advisors trained 10 APROSC trainers in the project methodology, which employs an inductive, systematic, problemsolving approach to planning.  This methodology was standardized into a 2-week Management Skills Development Program which has been conducted seven times (the last two times by APROSC with minimal outside help) for 114 trainers and agricultural planners and managers (28 from APROSC, the rest from other GON entities); in the process, the original course materials, developed by the Coverdale Organization, England, have been adapted for use in Nepal.  Also as planned, a 75-page supplement of successful Nepalese planning and management practices, based on field research and follow-up consultations has been produced; consultations, however, have been largely neglected by the project and there is little evidence that the supplement is being widely used.  Further, several factors, including a lack of senior trainers, inadequate publicity (despite several project-related publications by APROSC) and trainer training strategy, ill-defined field research methods/skills, and high costs, limit APROSC's present capability to train mid-level personnel. Participant interviews have confirmed the appropriateness and relevance of the project, especially the planning methodology, the dissemination of which to mid-level government personnel has had a significant impact.  By contrast, direct impact on specific problems has been insignificant due to the project's emphasis on methodology over actual problemsolving and the lack of an integrated information/evaluation system. Recommendations are to help APROSC develop a long-range management training strategy and to disseminate project experience in Nepal to other countries.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID/TA-C-1350","","3/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Management|Problem solving|Agricultural management|Agricultural policy|Agricultural planning|Agricultural training|Technical assistance|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data plus","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM623.pdf","1,461 KB","000064 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to implement in Egypt the Agricultural Sector Implementation Project (ASIP) approach for training agricultural managers and to develop an Egyptian supplement to the International ASIP Reference Book.  Special evaluation covers the period 10/77-3/80 and is based in part on interviews with trainees. The project did not achieve its planned results by its original termination date of 10/79, and was extended to 7/31/80; since the extension the project has picked up momentum.  About 200 midlevel and a few senior managers have been trained; the basic course is being taught by Egyptians in Arabic for the first time; and an enthusiastic, though small, Egyptian staff is gaining experience.  However, the task of institutionalizing the ASIP method is far from complete. Preparation of an Egyptian reference book on agriculture management is also far behind schedule, but a small collection of ""Successful Practices"" is being assembled. Several factors have contributed to the project's deficiencies.  The project design was ""Egyptianized"" too late and at too low a level. Contractor capabilities did not meet the scope of the project, especially the research aspects (needs assessment, identification of successful practices, and development of the reference book); at least one team member should have had a clear grasp of ASIP methods and a good working knowledge of Arabic.  Inadequate supervision by AID/W caused confusion in communications.  Because the project has not been institutionalized in terms of the Ministry of Agriculture budget, it has been handicapped in both planning and staffing by uncertainty about available funds.  There has been no systematic assessment of the project's impact on actual management practice.  Activities complementing training, e.g., follow-up and consulting work, need strengthening.  Most importantly, the project has made little effort to involve top-level and lower-level (e.g., cooperative managers) personnel. Recommendations are made for a follow-on project which would incorporate a comprehensive results-oriented management development program.","Duplicate fiche: PD-AAM-630","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural management|Manuals and handbooks|Agricultural training|Technical assistance|Beneficiary interviews","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM683.pdf","901 KB","","","000079 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to provide nonformal vocational training and management training in Sierra Leone.  Special evaluation covers the period 1976-11/80 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with USAID/SL, Government of Sierra Leone (GOSL), and project personnel and with training program graduates and their supervisors. Opportunities Industrialization Centers, Sierra Leone (OIC/SL) has displayed a viable structure and sound operation, but its prospects for achieving financial self-sufficiency appear bleak. Local staff have been trained in OIC philosophy and in instructional techniques and are now capable of carrying out most routine operational tasks, however their managerial and institutional skills need further honing.  Due to the enormous financial difficulties which have besieged Sierra Leone, private fundraising has fallen far short of even the revised targets. It appears that the GOSL will have to absorb most expenditures when the project ends. A total of 375 vocational trainees have completed feeder training (vs. a target of 300), and 203 have been placed in jobs (vs. 185 targeted); the former trainees' supervisors confirm that their job performance is satisfactory.  Howeve, the project's 5-year placement targets will probably not be met, due to the country's pervasive financial difficulties and a lack of personnel (there is only one job developer, who must serve 12 districts in 3 provinces) and of transportation. Another 222 persons have completed training at OIC/SL's Management and Business Development Center (MBDC); 48 others are still in training. Instead of conducting four 3-month training cycles per year as planned, the MBDC has offered 12-week (34% of enrollments), 8-10 week (52%), and 3-week (14%) training cycles. The MBDC has suffered from personnel turnover and a lack of staff possessing practical experience in business, banking, and commerce.  Although the MBDC has made more effort to attract private sector trainees, it is still biased in favor of training public sector personnel.  Plans for assisting small entrepreneurs and for helping to develop the small business sector in general have been vague in both strategy and expected output. Ten recommendations to enhance OIC/SL institutionalization and to further strengthen its operational effectiveness are made.","Evaluation period: 17-28 Nov 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Vocational training|Technical training|Personnel development|Beneficiary interviews","Sierra Leone","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBAJ993.pdf","1,665 KB","000912 - Opportunities Industrialization Centers International, Inc.","","008602 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen planning and management within Liberia's Ministry of Agriculture (MOA).  Ex post evaluation covers the period 1972-76 and is based on document review and interviews with persons having special knowledge of the project. Although the project attempted to address fundamental problems within the MOA, its impact was severely limited due to political and organizational constraints.  The MOA was unable to provide a framework for planning and managing a sound agricultural program. Within the Ministry, individual, uncoordinated projects developed their own vested interests and ad hoc implementation arrangements inevitably evolved. Neither research nor extension policies were developed, efforts in these areas were not coordinated, and training needs inventories were never conducted for either the MOA or the overall agricultural sector. Project training was beneficial, but not always exactly as planned. Of 35 MOA participants, 23 completed Master's degrees (mostly in Agricultural Economics and Statistics), 7 attended short courses, 2 completed diploma courses, and 3 attended conferences abroad.  As a result, the MOA's Statistical Division became operational (but two subsequent Ministers ignored its contributions) and a Planning Bureau was created.  The latter, initially well staffed and operated, was vitiated as most staff with postgraduate training left the MOA when A.I.D. and World Bank in 1976 inadvertently undercut sectoral planning by focusing on integrated rural development.  A few have returned to top MOA positions where, overburdened with administrative duties, they are unable to perform the job for which they were trained. Moreover, abuses in the soil science component by supervisors and politicians led to the departure of contracted soil scientists; a marketing system was not established within the MOA because the Minister staffed the Marketing Sections with incompetent persons (family and political connections); no technology transfer function was developed, partly because no technology existed to be transferred and partly because of meager MOA resources. In brief, the project, while well-designed, suffered from misguided optimism about MOA resources (leadership, manpower, funds) and the Liberian work ethic.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Government departments|Agricultural planning|Agricultural management|Limited data","Liberia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN889.pdf","547 KB","008570 - USAID.

"Evaluates grant to assist the Indiana University International Development Institute's Program of Advanced Studies of Institution Building and Technical Assistance Methodologies (PASITAM) to disseminate organization and management information for use by A.I.D., contractor, and host country organizations. Special evaluation covers the period 1977-11/80 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with PASITAM staff. Although the materials produced by PASITAM have differed somewhat from original plans, overall outputs have been responsive to grant objectives.  Twelve design notes, three design studies, two textbooks, and nine newsletters have been produced by PASITAM; four additional notes were to have been published by 2/81. During FY 80, PASITAM's Documentation and Analysis Center processed 895 materials and information requests, primarily from AID/W.  To conduct its informational services, PASITAM has developed a small, selected in-house collection of materials, and monitors publications/reports from some 150 governmental and 400 non-governmental organizations.  In addition, PASITAM has produced eight training modules (two others are in progress) on a series of development-related topics.  Analytical skills workshops have been conducted to allow PASITAM's staff to establish contacts with A.I.D. field personnel and receive feedback to improve its dissemination efforts. Recommendations are to:  extend support for the project after the current grant expires in 2/81; authorize PASITAM to expand its production of multi-media training modules if additional funds are available; and encourage PASITAM to seek new ways to strengthen its contacts with LDC organizations.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/ta-G-1444","","11/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Information dissemination|Educational materials|Information services","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP025.pdf","285 KB","002619 - Indiana University.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the capability of the Government of Zaire (GOZ) to monitor and control malaria, reduce morbidity and mortality rates, and develop cadres, infrastructure, and methodologies to prevent/control malaria.  Special evaluation covers the period 6/76-11/80 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with GOZ, AID/Z, World Health Organization (WHO), and Peace Corps personnel and with missionaries and private citizens. Implementation was delayed for more than a year, due mainly to the late arrival of A.I.D. malaria advisors, personnel shortages, and a lack of communication between the GOZ and the WHO.  The Malaria Commission appointed by the GOZ to oversee the pilot project lacked specific terms of reference and was confused about its policy guidance and review functions.  Baseline data was not collected in the targeted urban area (although blood surveys were conducted), provision was not made for the formal training of malaria personnel, and little emphasis was placed on preoperational baseline data.  Nevertheless, baseline data was obtained for rural areas (either before or during spraying), a fully staffed national malaria service was established, and a malaria control program plan put into effect.  A malaria support laboratory has also been partially completed. Lessons learned are:  collect baseline data before starting operations; devote at least a year to staff recruitment and training; study the project agreement to understand its provisions, background, and purposes; study/review A.I.D. and host country commitments and third party obligations; chart planned and actual achievements; maintain a file of all communications and reports; establish standard operating procedures and prepare personnel manuals; plan program needs using indicator methods; delegate authority for developing cadres for the program; maintain linkages among all components; create an employee suggestion program; conduct management analysis and program planning/evaluation activities and properly delegate authority; revise programs in countries with similar activities; do not institute local methods of operation at the expense of proven U.S. methods; and consider buying more efficient vehicles. Recommendations are included.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","11/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Malaria|Institution building|Disease prevention and control|Health research|Data collection|Data processing","Congo DR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAP669.pdf","3,573 KB","001318 - American Public Health Association.

"Evaluates project to improve the institutional capability of the Egyptian science and technology community to develop and manage research programs.  Special evaluation covers the period to 5/80. Program progress is commendable.  Increased Egyptian capability to develop and manage applied research programs is already observable and this program has the potential for continued and greater contributions to that goal.  Ten projects have been identified and all but two are underway.  The Academy for Scientific Research and Technology (ASRT) and the National Research Center (NRC) have organized, managed, and implemented applied research programs in the following areas: instrumentation, management training, phosphate ore utilization, wool scouring, corrosion in the petroleum industry, Red Sea fisheries, biogas technology, more and better foods, and new crops. The effort expended in clarifying and improving the project designs has been an educational investment important to the program purpose. Applied research is increasingly understood and is gaining acceptance as an institutional and personal goal. Project and sub-project performance, although variable, is excellent given delays both in project initiation and the provision of certain inputs.  There has been active interaction with the users and potential beneficiaries of research. The technical competence and commitment of the project staff is generally high and has contributed greatly to progress.  The number of experienced and highly trained scientists or engineers may, in some cases, be larger than necessary with the potential for underutilization and decreased job satisfaction.  Most projects are making good use of existing equipment and facilities in the absence of newer items. Presently approved projects have often been studied by Egyptian or U.S./Egyptian researchers.  Current efforts are broadly classified as industrial or food-related.  A more direct approach for choosing future projects needs to be found, linkages between projects should be strengthened, and a greater effort to market project information should be made.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Applied research|Institution building|Scientific cooperation|Scientific progress|Scientific information|Technology|Research management","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP130.pdf","990 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation","","Stone, Clinton A.|Kehr, August|et al.","","6 May 1980","","","","Evaluation report : applied science and technology research","","PD-AAP-130","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTgxOTk0","Egypt","2630016"
"Evaluates Phase II of a project, implemented by Opportunities Industrialization Centers (OIC), to provide nonformal vocational training to early school leavers in Ghana.  Final external evaluation covers the period through 5/80 and is based on interviews with random samples of trainees, instructors, and employers/supervisors. The program is strong, viable, and of great service.  OIC trains carpenters, masons, typists, plumbers, electricians, commercial artists, mechanics, caterers, and bookkeepers.  Curricula are comprehensive and relevant to industrial needs.  Both feeder and vocational training take longer than planned, however; while this may be due partly to the late openings of two training centers, a significant increase cannot be expected unless course length is reduced.  During Phase II, some 950 trainees (59% of target) will complete feeder (prevocational) instruction and some 850 placements (63%) will be made.  Training was also provided to 241 redundant civil servants in a special effort which forced centers into two-shift operation. The value of OIC's training methodology is shown by the superior level of its graduates.  Almost 53% of OIC trainees are considered above-average by employers/supervisors, and another 30% considered average - both figures far above what might be expected from a group of school leavers.  However, lowered industrial activity and heightened employer selectivity are decreasing the marketability and bargaining power of OIC graduates, who lack the nationally recognized National Vocational Training Institute (NVTI) Certificate; OIC is incorporating NVTI standards into its curricula. While OIC/Ghana's claims a 100% placement rate, its count includes multiple placements (i.e., frequent job changes) for the same individuals.  The true placement rate, although undoubtedly high, is unknown.  Likewise, the claimed 94% job retention rate is probably overstated, again because of ""job-hopping"" for better pay. Although OIC's open enrollment policy and individually paced nonformal training are not wholly comparable to other vocational programs, its costs are close to those of other Ghanaian institutions. The program's major shortcoming is a lack of long-term planning and of procedures defining local/national roles and responsibilities.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Vocational training|School dropouts|Nonformal education|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","Ghana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP305.pdf","1,157 KB","001172 - Barnett and Engel","","008547 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Institute for International Development, Inc. (IIDI), a private voluntary organization emphasizing small business and agricultural development.  Special self evaluation covers the period 1/79-9/80 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with domestic and overseas personnel. Operationally, IIDI has been on the right track.  Emphasis has been on creating employment opportunities for poor people by fostering small businesses; most projects have been agricultural or food related. Numerous small industry enterprises have been developed to create new jobs; formal training efforts have been favorably received by the clients; some private investors have been found and the basis for a far larger return in the future identified; some women have become entrepreneurs with IIDI assistance; and projects will probably endure loan repayment. IIDI has actively applied appropriate technology but has been unable to integrate it with the employment segment. Major IIDI strengths include:  the generation of new ideas to replace obsolete ones; good leadership; managers with successful business backgrounds; high efficiency; nationwide contacts; Christian concern; knowledge of the causes of poverty; and a staff committed to help those they work with.  Weaknesses include:  inadequate and narrow private support; too small an operation due to limited funding; a need for improved headquarters/field relationships; insufficient service to investor/sponsors; and no worldwide image. An organization's strength can also cause problems.  Within IIDI, the religious biases of an individual staff member have influenced the eligibility of an applicant for consideration. Using the church related network to identify potential entrepreneurs conflicts with the aim and spirit of IIDI; this should be clarified with each of the field directors and with staff to ensure proper implementation.  It is also recommended that the previously under- and unemployed be incorporated into projects and that efforts be more community oriented.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Institution building","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP423.pdf","1,326 KB","003763 - Institute for International Development, Inc.","","","English","","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation|Pre evaluation data","","","","1980","","","","Institute for International Development, Inc. : a strategic (self-) evaluation","","PD-AAP-423","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTgyOTY2","Private and Development Cooperation","9380131"

"Evaluates project to assist the Government of Somalia (GOS) to conduct a modern technologies farmer training program in Somalia's bay region.  Special evaluation covers the period 1979-3/80 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with GOS personnel, Participating Agency Service Agreement (PASA) team members, and project beneficiaries. Good progress has been made in the first four months of project implementation.  PASA team members have taken the opportunity to familiarize themselves with farmers' problems in the bay region and determine a course of action to follow with regard to field activities. Three PASA team members have been placed onsite and stress has been put on setting up field demonstrations. seven/eight demonstrations have been held in five villages employing such crops as sorghum, cow peas, and groundnuts. Farmers have not been reluctant to take part in setting up these demonstrations.  A regional project manager and six village extension agents have already been assigned to the project (five are located in their assigned villages, one is currently unassigned), and an organizational chart for staffing and operating the Bonka Training Center has been tentatively approved. However, only limited effort has been put into developing a training process; the main emphasis has been on applying an apprenticeship approach.  The village extensionists have had only a limited high school education in agriculture and have had little practical experience in farming.  Therefore, they are observing and learning from the PASA team members.  One team member has worked with extensionists on a one-to-one basis to solve whatever problems occur.  However, a more coordinated training approach is needed as the number of extensionists in the region increases.  Participant training was to have been provided on both a long- and short-term basis but has yet to be implemented. Sixteen recommendations are noted.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural extension|Agricultural training|Institution building|Cropping systems|Beneficiary interviews","Somalia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP501.pdf","883 KB","008604 - USAID.

"Evaluates Phase I of a project to develop the capability of Upper Volta's Central Livestock Service and 3 Regional Development Organizations to develop environmentally sound village livestock management systems.  Special evaluation covers the period 5/76-9/80 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel. Disagreements among USAID/UV, the Government of Upper Volta (GOUV), and Consortium for International Development (CID) project personnel over Phase I's stress on experimentation rather than action hindered implementation.  Resolution of these problems was complicated by lack of GOUV counterparts, shortages of USAID/UV clerical and translation support and of operating funds, and poor interpersonal relations (which were partially alleviated by replacing both the GOUV Project Director and the USAID/UV Project Manager). Some activities were changed to accomodate the 1.5 year delay in finding and installing a TA contractor.  Achievements were to: train 12 GOUV encadreurs, 1 agricultural statistician, 2 range and animal management specialists, and a project administrator; collect baseline data; establish 6 village livestockmen's associations; establish a highly beneficial vaccination and deparasitage program at each project site; dig 14 water wells; build 4 vaccination parks; provide vaccine cold storage at 2 sites; and complete 2 range resource surveys and 2 range management demonstrations.  Salt/mineral feeding and poultry projects did not prove cost-effective. Phase I, which four PCV's ably assisted, provided much useful data for future GOUV livestock and land use development, although only a partially proven management package was developed for Phase II and CID's plan for that phase included too many research and/or test options and failed to use lessons learned from Phase I.  A project management system is still needed and such areas as vehicle maintenance, fuel delivery, and inventory control need improvement. The project taught, inter alia, that:  all parties should completely understand the project from the outset; project revisability should be stipulated in technical contracts; high-level counterparts are essential to implementation; and disinterested parties should be called upon to assess disputes. Specific recommendations for Phase II are made.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Livestock|Animal husbandry|Agricultural management|Agricultural training|Agricultural research","Burkina Faso","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP502.pdf","1,704 KB","008620 - USAID.

"Provides final Mission report (1976-82) on a project to increase production by Thai farmers by encouraging the use of improved seed. Despite an unrealistic design, the project was exceptionally successful in achieving its objectives.  Production of seed for six crops (rice, corn, soybean, peanut, mungbean, sorghum) increased from 173 MT in FY 1976 to 5,896 MT in FY 1982. Increases in direct counter sales at the Seed Centers and farmers' willingness to travel great distances to obtain improved seed indicate that farmer demand for most varieties of project seed is strong.  In addition, 3,600 contract farm families are currently receiving assistance in seed production, up from the 200 contract farm families organized at the start of the project. A Seed Division (SD) with a technically competent staff of 250 (helped by the project's provision of M.Sc. training to 6 persons and 3-month training of 8 others in the United States)  was created within the Department of Agricultural Extension to manage Thai Government (RTG) seed activities and to promote the national seed industry; the major project role envisioned for the Marketing Organization for Farmers never materialized.  In line with a stated project objective, 60% of all seed produced by the SD is used to support RTG emergency assistance projects (the rest is sold outright to small farmers).  Modern seed processing centers were established at Chainat, Korat, Phitsanulok, and Lampang, emphasizing production of the six crops mentioned above. Production of rhizobium inoculant rose from 3 tons annually in 1976 to over 20 tons at the project's close, although demand is still substantially below production capacity. Despite the project's successes, which have spurred interest by other donors, problem areas have had to be addressed by the follow-on project - ineffective marketing and distribution of processed seed, underpicing of seed, and the too rapid expansion of the seed program. Lessons learned are:  delays should be expected when loan projects require host country procurement of TA and equipment; small farmers can be successfully trained as contract growers to produce quality seed; establishment of a seed program/industry is a long-term process; and public sector seed programs can act as a catalyst for private sector involvement.","Loan no. 493-T-017|Grant no. 493-106-T","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Crop production|Seed production|Distribution|Institution building|Beneficiary count|Limited data","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP883.pdf","645 KB","008613 - USAID.

"Evaluates Family Life Education Project (FLEP) to provide learner-centered nonformal education in rural Ghanaian communities. Special evaluation covers the period 1978-9/80 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with personnel of Ghana's Department of Social Welfare and Community Development (DSWCD) and with FLEP community facilitators and group members. Due mainly to the severe economic problems facing Ghana and the DSWCD, the project has not been able to achieve targeted outputs. Certain aspects, however, have been successful, most especially training of community facilitators, which is undoubtedly the single most important factor determining FLEP group success. Approximately 25 days of facilitator training were provided, some in local languages. Training of senior DSWCD staff was reduced in scope (only 4 of 12 planned workshops held) due to logistic and economic constraints. Only 7 new FLEP groups, vs. a targeted 25, have been established. Most groups (45 exist, 37 are fully active) are devoting more attention to economic activities than to literacy training or adult education (which were intended to be the primary FLEP activities).  Twenty-five are involved in small-scale economic projects; these have received project loans ($500-4,000) and are, on the whole, doing well.  Some 60% of the groups have initiated self-help (small infrastructure) projects, although none of the funds earmarked for this purpose have yet been disbursed.  The low levels of literacy training being provided result in part from the project's inability (due to lack of printing supplies and equipment) to disseminate the revised literacy materials which it has developed. The project, which was overambitious to begin with, should have been redesigned as soon as the effect of Ghana's crippling economic problems on project resources (staff, money, vehicles, fuel) became apparent. Since FLEP's economic activities have overshadowed educational efforts, a collaborative arrangement with a group (such as Technoserve) expert in small scale economics and marketing should be considered.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Literacy instruction|Community self help|Nonformal education|Rural development|Adult education|Small scale enterprises|Commercial credit|Beneficiary interviews","Ghana","","","001295 - World Education, Inc.","","008547 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to provide specialized U.S. training for key Syrian technicians and Government of Syria (GOS) officials and academic development-related training to faculty of Syrian universities.  Special evaluation covers the period 2/75-9/79 and is based on review of USAID/S project records and of the 145 responses received from 270 questionnaires sent to returned participants. Of some 475 participants financed during FY75-79 (57 for postgraduate academic training and 418 for technical training), 325 have departed and 273 have returned.  For the most part, participants' responses were favorable to the project and their criticisms constructive.  Of the 145 questionnaire respondents, 102 indicated that the training program had been well arranged; 33% stated that they used their training regularly, while 45.5% said they used it occasionally.  Language problems were the most frequently encountered difficulty.  Gaps or failure in U.S. support services - particularly the availability of housing and transportation and the receipt of stipends - were a problem for some. An unexpected effect of the project has been increased good will between the United States and Syria; only 8 respondants cited any problems with Americans, and none of these problems were serious. The project has shown that:  (1) host country governments can upgrade the technical/managerial capabilities of government personnel through relatively short-term overseas training; (2) unspecified broader benefits - in this case improved U.S.-Syrian relations - can result from participant training projects; and (3) priority development needs must be enforced in selecting participants to ensure that Syria will benefit upon their return. Recommended project changes are improved training, cultural orientation, and participant inputs from USAID/Syria and improved AID/W backstopping.  Additionally, greater measures should be taken in the future to ensure that training addresses Syria's priority development needs, particularly health, education, and agriculture.

"Evaluates integrated rural development project in two Jamaican watersheds.  Special evaluation covers the period 5/79-6/80 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with senior project and TA personnel and with farmers. Despite delays due to unseasonable rains and the late arrival of equipment and TA personnel, good progress has been made.  In the erosion control component, over 2,000 acres of public and 3,000 acres of private land could be reforested during the life of the project; data on land treatment activities are incomplete.  About 30% of farmers in the area have completed plans for soil conservation (SC); 68% of the plans have been approved and 45% are being already being implemented.  Staff have adapted well to farmer desires to carry out soil treatment themselves, but this has complicated the issue of farmer contributions to the SC fund. Also, SC costs have been higher than expected. The extension program is weak with regard to the economic returns of different SC methods, partly because research activities (which have focused on cropping systems) have been set independently of extensionists.  Construction of infrastructure - electrical lines, housing, roads, and potable water systems - has begun. The farmer organization support component has helped farmers procure credit and has created development committees for farmer involvement, but it lacks a strategy to fully involve small farmer organizations, a failure affecting the project across the board.  Regarding training, three long-term participants have been trained in agronomy; 178 others have received short-term training in SC, agricultural credit, and home economics. Because insufficient funds were allotted for TA, several crucial skills have not been available; funds will be exhausted well before project end.  Data collection and feedback systems, especially for the farm plans, are inadequate; more attention to farmer traditions is needed. Replication in Jamaica will depend on the degree to which less costly SC methods are found.  The implementation strategy should be revised to address developmental goals more directly, with emphasis on strengthening local organizations and the project should be extended to 9/84.  Eight other recommendations address the problems noted above.","Attached to PD-AAJ-760","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1980 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Soil conservation|Agricultural extension|Beneficiary interviews|Project change","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ760A.pdf","4,812 KB","008563 - USAID.
