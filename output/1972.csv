"BOTH THE RADIO SCHOOL MOVEMENT AND THE CENTRAL OFFICE OF ACCION CULTURAL POPULAR HONDURENA HAVE DONE REMARKABLY WELL IN ACHIEVING THE PROJECT GOALS. THE GENERAL GOAL HAS BEEN TO MOTIVATE THE INDIVIDUAL TO BECOME CONSCIOUS OF HIS OWN CAPACITIES FOR DEVELOPMENT AND THE POSSIBILITIES OF DEVELOPMENT IN HIS COMMUNITY. THE RADIO SCHOOL MOVEMENT HAS BEEN  QUIT SUCCESSFUL IN ITS GOALS OF DEVELOPING ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY AND PARTICIPATORY COLLECTIVE DECISION-MAKING INSTITUTIONS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES AND STIMULATING THE GENERAL MOTIVATION TO INITIATE SOCIAL CHANGE. REGARDING THE GOAL OF LITERACY TRAINING, THE RADIO SCHOOL MOVEMENT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO RADICALLY REDUCE THE LEVEL OF ILLITERACY. IT HAS ALSO HAD LITTLE SUCESS IN ITS GOAL OF DEVELOPING A GREATER AWARENESS OF, AND ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN, THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENTAL PROCESS, BUT IT HAS INFLUENCED THE GROWTH OF A MORE BALANCED CONSTRUCTIVE POLITICAL ATTITUDE AT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY LEVEL AND HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE REFORM OF MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT. RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE: (1) CENTER EDUCATION ON THE FOCAL CONCERNS OF THE CAMPESINO; (2) HELP TO PROVIDE RESOURCES, NOT JUST MOTIVATION; (3) DEVELOP A SOURCE OF PRIDE IN THE CAMPESINO IDENTITY; AND (4) PREPARE THE CAMPESINO IN HIS COMMUNITY TO ESTABLISH LINKAGES WITH THE LARGER SOCIETY.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1972 12:00:00 AM","","Sociology research|Economic research|Community development|LITERACY|Health education","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAU552.pdf","8,115 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","","","WHITE, ROBERT A.","Adult education","1 Oct 1972","","","","Adult education program of Accion cultural popular Hondurena : an evaluation of the rural development potential of the radio school movement in Honduras; summary report","","PN-AAU-552","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc0MDIw","Honduras","5229706"
"THE NUTRITIONAL PROBLEMS IN PARAGUAY HAVE NOT CHANGED GREATLY SINCE 1965. THE PL 480 PROGRAM IS DIRECTED PRIMARILY AT THE POPULATION GROUPS WHICH HAVE THE GREATEST NUTRITIONAL DEFICIENCIES. IT REACHES THE HIGHEST PRIORITY GROUPS OF RECIPIENTS BY WORKING THROUGH SCHOOLS AND HEALTH CENTERS. ONLY 25 PERCENT OF ALL PRIMARY SCHOOLS AND 37 PERCENT OF ALL PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTIONS OFFICIALLY PARTICIPATE IN THE TITLE II PROGRAM, AND A SPOT CHECK REVEALED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PERCENTAGE OF THESE DID NOT ACTUALLY PARTICIPATE. THUS, THE PROGRAM FALLS SHORT OF ITS POTENTIAL TARGETS. CERTAIN PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS SERVE TO BIAS THE PROGRAM AGAINST THE MOST ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED AND MOST REMOTE POPULATION GROUPS -- THOSE WHO HAVE THE GREATEST NEED FOR THE PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM IS ADEQUATELY TIED TO NUTRITIONAL EDUCATION IN THE HEALTH CENTERS AN D NUTRITION WILL PLAY AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE SCHOOLS AS NEW CURRICULUM PROGRAMS ARE IMPLEMENTED. THE GOVERNMENT OF PARAGUAY (GOP) IS AWARE OF THE NUTRITIONAL PROBLEMS OF THE COUNTRY AND HAS A POSITIVE ATTITUDE TOWARD THEIR SOLUTION, ALTHOUGH IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE A SENSE OF COMMITMENT TOWARD NUTRITIONAL MATTERS.

"THE PURPOSE OF THIS REPORT IS TO PROVIDE DOCUMENTATION AND GUIDANCE FOR A REVIEW OF THE MISSION'S PRIVATE ENTERPRISE PROGRAM. THE REPORT COVERS (1)THE ACTUAL GOALS OF THE PROJECT, (2)A REVIEW OF ITS BROADER POLICY AND DEVELOPMENT IMPLICATIONS, AND (3)A TENTATIVE DETERMINATION OF THE PROGRAM'S RELATIONSHIP TO AND OVERALL PRIORITY WITHIN THE MISSION'S OTHER PROGRAMS. THE PROGRAM'S MACRO-ECONOMIC IMPACT HAS BEEN MODEST TO DATE. IT HAS CREATED AN INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT OF $7 MILLION A YEAR WITH A CORRESPONDING 30 PERCENT INCREASE IN INDUSTRIAL EMPLOYMENT. ABOUT 6,000 NEW JOBS HAVE BEEN CREATED. THE FAVORABLE IMPACT ON AFGHANISTAN'S BALANCE OF PAYMENTS, BOTH IN TERMS OF IMPORT SUBSITITUTION AND EXPORT PROMOTION, HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLE. BECAUSE OF THE PROJECT'S NOTICEABLE EFFECT ON URBAN EMPLOYMENT AND INCOME DISTRIBUTION, THE PROJECT IS SLOWLY BUT SURELY CHANGING CERTAIN VALUES IN THE TRADITIONAL SOCIETY. FURTHERMORE, BECAUSE OF ITS RELATIVELY HEAVY CONCENTRATION ON THE PROCESSING OF AGRICULTURAL RAW MATERIALS, IT IS INCREASING RURAL INCOME. THE MISSION FEELS THAT THE PROGRAM'S COST-BENEFIT RATIO HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE QUITE HIGH. BASED ON THE MERITS OF THE CASE, THE MISSION MAKES A STRONG RECOMMENDATION FOR A TWO-YEAR EXTENSION OF THE CONTRACT AND OUTLINES PROPOSED CHANGES AND ADDITIONAL SERVICES.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","NESA-526","","11/1/1972 12:00:00 AM","","Private enterprises|Industrial development|Balance of trade|Institution building|Industrial planning|Industrial policy|Industrial research|INVESTMENT|Industrial development banks","Afghanistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP189.pdf","15,723 KB","008504 - USAID.

"THE PRESENT DE FACTO DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES BETWEEN THE REGULAR LINE MINISTRIES WHICH CONCENTRATE ON LARGER POPULATION GROUPINGS AND THE NATIONAL COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT SERVICE (NCDS) WHICH CONCENTRATES ON SMALL RURAL COMMUNITIES MAY WELL BE THE MOST PRACTICAL APPROACH TO INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT AND EXTENDING THE TAX BASE IN BOLIVIA FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS. NCDS CAN CONTINUE TO PERFORM AN ESSENTIAL CATALYTIC ROLE IN STIMULATING THE EXTENSION OF GOVERNMENT SERVICES TO THE RURAL COMMUNITIES. WHILE THE PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING VILLAGE LEVEL INSTITUTIONS HAS BEEN SLOW AND HAS TAKEN A VARIETY OF FORMS, THE CONCEPT OF ORGANIZATION, SELF-HELP, AND COOPERATION IS TAKING HOLD IN COMMUNITIES INVOLVED IN THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. NCDS NEEDS AN INFORMATION SYSTEM WHICH CAN PINPOINT THE BOTTLENECKS DURING THE PROJECT APPROVAL AND IMPLEMENTATION PROCESSES. ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM IN THE FIELD IS GENERALLY QUITE GOOD, HOWEVER, CERTAIN PROBLEMS WERE OBSERVED, EG, MISSING PROJECT DOCUMENTATION, GAPS IN WORK SCHEDULING PROCEDURES, LATE PAYMENT OF SALARIES, AND SOME LACK OF MOBILITY, WHICH SHOULD BE CORRECTED.

"THE DIRECTED AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION CREDIT (DAPC) PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED TO COMBINE THE PROVISION OF CREDIT WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THE EVALUATION WAS DESIGNED TO MEASURE THE RESULTS OF THIS PROGRAM IN TERMS OF INCREASED PRODUCTION AND INCOME AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER PROGRAM PROBLEMS WERE RESULTS OF THE PROJECT OR DUE TO INHERENT CONCEPTUAL FLAWS. THE EVALUATORS CONCLUDED THAT ALL SPECIFIC INDICATORS SUPPORT THE CONCLUSION THAT BOTH PRODUCTION AND INCOME INCREASED, ALTHOUGH NOT DRAMATICALLY AND NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE OF THE DAPC PROGRAM. THEY ALSO CONCLUDED THAT THE CONCEPT OF DIRECTED CREDIT IS VIABLE. THE PRINCIPAL PROBLEMS ARE: (1)LACK OF ADEQUATE CREDIT, (2)LACK OF EFFECTIVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, (3)NEED FOR IMPROVED ADMINISTRATION, AND (4)INADEQUATE MARKETING PROGRAMS. PRIMARY RECOMMENDATIONS ARE: (1)FECOAC (NATIONAL FEDERATION OF SAVINGS AND LOAN COOPERATIVES) SHOULD ASSIST DAPC COOPERATIVES IN ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING RELATIONSHIPS WITH TECHNICAL SOURCES, (2)FECOAC SHOULD SET UP THE DAPC PROGRAM AS A SEPARATE ENTITY WITH SPECIFIC GUIDELINES, TRAINING COURSES, AND REQUIRE A FIELD INSPECTOR FOR EACH COOPERATIVE, AND (3)THE MARKETING PROBLEM SHOULD BE STUDIED IN DEPTH.

"THE MOST IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION PROBLEM OF THIS PROJECT IS THAT TWO OF ITS FOUR PROGRAMS, THE CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM AND THE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM, DEPEND UPON THE GOVERNMENT OF ECUADOR (GOE) FOR SUBSTANTIAL INPUTS. ECUADOR'S FINANCIAL SITUATION WORSENED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER THE PROJECT WAS LAUNCHED WHICH MADE IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN FUNDS FOR SUCH THINGS AS INSPECTION, CONSTRUCTION SUPERVISION, AND MAINTENANCE, EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE IMPORTANT TO THE LONG RANGE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM. THE COURSE OF ACTION CHOSEN BY THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION HAS LOCKED IT INTO A PROGRAM OF BUILDING A RELATIVELY INSIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF EXPENSIVE CLASSROOMS WHILE THE COUNTRY SUFFERS FROM A CLASSROOM SHORTAGE SO SEVERE THAT AN INCREASED DROPOUT RATE SEEMS INEVITABLE. THE TEXTBOOK PROGRAM IS BEHIND SCHEDULE BUT IT IS PROGRESSING STEADILY TOWARD ITS GOALS. THE TEACHER TRAINING PROGRAM, ORIGINALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT, HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY CHANGED. THESE CHANGES CONFIRM THE IMPROBABILITY OF THE THREE NORMAL SCHOOLS TO BE CONSTRUCTED SERVING AS VEHICLES FOR EDUCATION REFORM AS WAS PLANNED. THE EVALUATORS MAKE 22 RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDING; (1)REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CLASSROOMS TO BE CONSTRUCTED UNDER THE PROJECT FROM 3,000 TO 1,300; AND (2)DESIGN A LOWER COST STANDARD CLASSROOM THAT COULD BE USED AFTER THIS PROGRAM TERMINATES.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1972 12:00:00 AM","","Primary education|Educational facilities|Textbooks|Teacher training|Educational development|Classrooms|Building construction","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA745A1.pdf","1,445 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","","","MILES, HENRY L.|MAGILL, JOHN H.","Basic education","1 Jan 1972","","","","EVALUATION REPORT ON THE PRIMARY EDUCATION PROJECT FUNDED BY LOAN 518-L-027 AND GRANT 518-11-690-075.1","","PD-AAA-745-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc0MDUx","Ecuador","518007501"
"MALARIA TRANSMISSION IN HAITI VARIES GREATLY FROM ONE YEAR TO ANOTHER, FROM YEARS OF MINOR TRANSMISSION TO ALARMING SITUATIONS WHEN THE ATMOSPHERICAL CONDITIONS ARE FAVORABLE TO MULTIPLICATION AND LONGEVITY OF VECTORS. THE POTENTIAL OF TRANSMISSION IN RURAL AREAS HAS NOT CHANGED SINCE THE YEARS PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE PROGRAM BECAUSE THE ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS ARE THE SAME BOTH WITH REGARD TO THE VECTOR AND TO THE HOST.

"PLANNING AND EXECUTION OF WORK IN THE PREPARATORY PHASE WAS GOOD. SHORTFALLS IN OUTPUT OCCURRED IN SOME AREAS, WITH SOME OVERAGES IN OTHERS. HOWEVER, THE OVERALL IMPACT OF THE FIRST PHASE OF THE PROGRAM IS VERY GOOD INDEED. THERE IS A REASONABLE BASIS OF DATA AND EXPERIENCE WHICH CAN BE USED TO MODIFY PHASE II TARGETS AND DIRECTIONS. THE EVALUATION CONCENTRATED ON THE FIVE COMPLEMENTARY THRUSTS OF THE PREPARATORY PHASE: RESEARCH, TRIAL CLINICS, NUTRITION, PERSONNEL SELECTION AND TRAINING, AND PUBLIC OPINION. THE PREPARATORY PHASE HAS FULFILLED ITS PURPOSE BY PROVIDING A BASIS OF EXPERIENCE FOR ENTERING THE OPERATIONS PHASE. SOME CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED SINCE THE ORIGINAL PROP WAS CHANGED AND A GREAT DEAL OF NEW INFORMATION HAS BEEN AND IS BEING GENERATED.

"THE PROJECT HAS ORGANIZED AND ANALYZED DATA IN SEVERAL SECTORS OF DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING MATERIALS THAT WILL SERVE ODEPLAN AND OTHER AGENCIES IN THE FORMULATION OF FUTURE POLICY. THE PROJECT HAS GENERATED A SERIES OF USEFUL POLICY SUGGESTIONS WHICH ARE WORTH CONSIDERATION BY ODEPLAN FOR IMPLEMENTATION, AND IT HAS SERVED TO MAINTAIN A VITAL LINK BETWEEN THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT AND A HIGH QUALITY UNIVERSITY RESEARCH UNIT.

"A PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION OF LASPAU'S (LATIN AMERICAN SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM OF AMERICAN UNIVERSITES, INC) OPERATION SHOWED THAT THERE HAS BEEN RAPID CHANGE AND DEVELOPMENT SINCE THE PROGRAM WAS INITIATED IN 1966. STARTING AS A MECHANISM FOR PROVIDING UNDERGRADUATE SCHOLARSHIPS, IT HAS EVOLVED INTO A SYSTEM LINKING NORTH AMERICAN AND LATIN AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES THAT PROVIDES POST-GRADUATE SCHOLARSHIPS TO YOUNG FACULTY MEMBERS OF LATIN AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES AND IMPROVES THEIR CAPACITY FOR TEACHING IN THEIR HOME UNIVERSITIES. THE EVALUATORS ESTIMATE THE DEMAND FOR LASPAU-TRAINED SCHOLARS TO BE MORE THAN A HUNDRED TIMES AS LARGE AS LASPAU'S CURRENT LEVEL. THE OPTIMUM LEVEL IS THE HIGHEST THAT CAN BE SUPPORTED BY RESOURSES AVAILABLE TO LASPAU; THE CURRENT LEVEL IS A MINIMUM, AND SHOULD BE RAISED BY 15% PER YEAR OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. LASPAU HAS ACCOMPLISHED AND IS ACCOMPLISHING EXCELLENT WORK OF VERY HIGH VALUE. RECOMMENDTIONS INCLUDE: (1)THE NUMBER OF SCHOLARS IN THE MASTERS PROGRAM SHOULD BE INCREASED AS RAPIDLY AS THE SEVERAL CONSTRAINTS PERMIT; (2) THERE SHOULD BE A SEARCH FOR DIVERSIFIED SOURCES OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THE PROGRAM; AND (3)AN EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE TO EXTEND THE PROGRAM TO INCLUDE UNIVERSITIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1972 12:00:00 AM","","SCHOLARSHIPS|Teacher training","Latin America","","","","","","English","","","","KREBS, WILLIAM A.|BURSK, EDWARD C.|et al.","","28 Nov 1972","","","","EVALUATION OF THE LATIN AMERICAN SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM OF AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES, INC.","","PD-AAB-658-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc0MDc3","Latin American Regional","5980453"
"THE BASIC OBJECTIVE OF THE ORIGINAL MAJOR CEREALS PROJECT WAS TO DEVELOP BREEDING METHODOLOGY ADAPTABLE TO MAIZE, SORGHUM AND MILLET, AND TO STRIVE FOR IMPROVEMENT OF THESE CROPS. TWO YEARS AGO, AN INSTITUTION-BUILDING ELEMENT WAS ADDED. MORE EMPHASIS IN THIS DIRECTION IS HIGHLY DESIRABLE. THE EVALUATION DETAILS MEASUREMENTS OF SUCCESS IN THE FOLLOWING: MAIZE GENETICS AND IMPROVEMENT; SORGHUM, FINGER MILLET, AND BULRUSH MILLET IMPROVEMENT; AND CEREALS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT. MAJOR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE: (1)MAIZE BREEDING SHOULD BE CONTINUED WITH MODIFICATION IN THE PROGRAM; (2)SORGHUM BREEDING SHOULD BE CONTINUED AS PRESENTLY ORGANIZED AND WITH INCREASED EMPHASIS ON IMPROVED CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE IN ORDER TO MOVE SORGHUM FROM A SOLELY SUBSISTENCE RANKING INTO COMMERCIAL CHANNELS; AND (3)RESEARCH WORK WITH THE MILLETS SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO THE INTERNATIONAL CROPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR THE SEMI-ARID TROPICS IN INDIA. THE EVALUATORS ALSO MADE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING; (1)RESEARCH REPORTING; (2)IMPROVING UTILIZATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS; (3)COUNTERPARTS AND TRAINING; (4)EMPHASIS ON INDUSTRIAL VS SUBSISTENCE CROPS; (5)INSTITUTIONALIZING CEREALS RESEARCH VIA THE EAST AFRICAN AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY ORGANIZATION; AND (6)PERSONNEL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND LOGISTICAL MATTERS.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1972 12:00:00 AM","","Cereals|Agricultural research|Maize|SORGHUM|Millet|Agricultural training|Educational materials|Plant genetics|Varietal research","East Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA531A1.pdf","8,770 KB","000024 - USAID.

"THOUGH IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY FOR CERTAIN WHAT THE SUPPLY-DEMAND SITUATION WILL BE REGARDING VETERINARIANS IN THE 1980'S, IT DOES APPEAR THAT THE PRESENTLY PROJECTED RATES AT WHICH THEY GRADUATE FROM THE TWO SCHOOLS COULD POSSIBLY LEAD TO AN OVER-SUPPLY. THE MOST OBVIOUS SOLUTION FOR THIS WOULD BE TO CONSOLIDATE THE IBADAN AND AHMADU BELLO UNIVERSITY (ABU) TRAINING PROGRAMS INTO A SINGLE REDUCED-SCALE OPERATION. DISCUSSIONS WITH KEY MEMBERS OF THE VETERINARY WORKING COMMUNITY INDICATED A FAVORABLE ATTITUDE TOWARD THE PERFORMANCE OF ABU VETERINARY GRADUATES, BUT ALSO SUPPORTED PROPOSALS THAT INCREASED CLASSROOM TIME BE DEVOTED TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND THAT COURSES BE OFFERED IN VERTEBRATE AND MAMMALIAN ZOOLOGY, APPLIED BOTANY, SOCIOLOGY, AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS, STATISTICS, AND ANIMAL ECOLOGY. ON THE BASIS OF DISCUSSIONS IN THE FIELD, INCREASED TRAINING IN PREVENTIVE MEDICINE, EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GRASSLAND FARMING WERE ALSO RECOMMENDED. THE EVALUATION SUPPORTS THE PLANS TO INCREASE THE ABU VETERINARY RESEARCH PROGRAM; THE OUTLINED RESEARCH PROGRAM PLAN APPEARS WELL CONCEIVED AND SHOULD BE APPROVED.

"THE PROJECT ONLY COMPLETELY ACCOMPLISHED TWO OF ITS SIX OBJECTIVES, PARTLY ACCOMPLISHED TWO OTHERS, AND COMPLETELY FAILED IN TWO. AS A RESULT, ONE MIGHT THINK THAT THE PROJECT WAS ONLY MARGINALLY SUCCESSFUL. AS A PRODUCTION PROGRAM, IT WAS MARGINALLY SUCCESSFUL. HOWEVER, IF ONE VIEWS THE PROGRAM AS AN EXTENSION TRAINING RATHER THAN PRODUCTION PROJECT, THEN IT MUST BE CONCLUDED THAT AS A PILOT EFFORT THE PROJECT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL. THE TWO MISSING ELEMENTS IN THE PROGRAM WERE THE TRAINING COLLEGE AND THE RESEARCH INPUT. ONE REASON FOR THIS FAILURE WAS THAT THE PROJECT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PRODUCTION-ORIENTED. THE SECOND AREA OF WEAKNESS IN THE PROGRAM WAS THE LACK OF AN EFFECTIVE LINK BETWEEN RESEARCH AND EXTENSION. THE PROJECT MADE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION IN DEVELOPING AN EXTENSION PROGRAM THAT HAS WIDE ADAPTABILITY TO GHANA. IT HELPED TO DEVELOP THE ABILITY OF THE FIELD STAFF OF THE EXTENSION SERVICE. HOWEVER, IT WAS DESIGNED SO AS NOT TO REQUIRE RESOURCES (MEN AND MONEY) THAT, WHILE POSSIBLY AVAILABLE FOR A PILOT PROJECT, WOULD BE EXCESSIVE FOR A NATIONAL PROGRAM. THE PROBLEM WITH THE PROJECT IS THAT IT MIXED PRODUCTION WITH EXTENSION TRAINING GOALS. AS A RESULT, THE PROJECT DID NOT COVER ALL ASPECTS OF EXTENSION BUT THOSE PRIMARILY RELATED TO PRODUCTION.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1972 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural extension|Agricultural production|RICE|Maize|Agricultural credit","Ghana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA559A1.pdf","2,193 KB","008547 - USAID.

"THIS EVALUATION CONCLUDES THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT POTENTIALS IN THE AREA OF PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT AS IT RELATES TO RURAL DEVELOPMENT. THESE HAVE POSITIVE IMPLICATIONS FOR RURAL DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE OF: (1)INCREASED PROVINCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES; (2)EMERGENT PROVINCIAL LEADERSHIP; (3)INABILITY OF NATIONAL AGENCIES TO DELIVER EFFECTIVELY TO RURAL AREAS; AND (4)POWERS WITHIN THE COMMAND OF PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT WHICH RELATE DIRECTLY TO EMPLOYMENT AND INCOME GROWTH AND DISTRIBUTION. THESE POWERS CONCERN TAXATION INTERLINKED TO BUILDING AND MAINTAINING RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE. THE PROVINCIAL DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE PROJECT (PDAP) HAS SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED THAT PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT INTEREST IN THE EXERCISE OF THESE POWERS IS STRONG AND GROWING. PDAP ASSISTS PROVINCIAL LEADERSHIP IN SELECTED PROVINCES TO BUILD CAPACITIES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO LOCAL DEVELOPMENT. CONSIDERING PDAP'S LIMITED RESOURCES, THE DEGREE OF ITS SUCCESS IS REMARKABLE. RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE: (1)STRENGTHEN THESE ACTIVITIES BY LOAN, GRANT, AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE; (2)ENCOURAGE GOP TO GIVE SERIOUS ATTENTION TO THE POTENTIAL OF PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS BY MAKING COMMITMENTS, PLANNING FOR PROGRAMS AND THEIR INTERRELATIONSHIPS TO THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT, MAKING COST ESTIMATES AND INVESTIGATING SPECIAL METHODS OF FUNDING; AND (3)CONTINUE PDAP.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1968 -","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1972 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Taxation|Government policy|EMPLOYMENT|Income distribution|Development project design|Development project implementation|Development project evaluation|Economic planning|Fiscal policy|Agricultural policy|Agricultural planning","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAD508A1.pdf","1,806 KB","008592 - USAID.

"END OF PROJECT STATUS REPORT BY USAID PROGRAM OFFICER UPON TERMINATION OF BRAZILIAN RURAL REHABILITATION AND REFORM PROJ ECT FOLLOWING THE BRAZILIAN GOVERMENT'S ABOLISHMENT OF GERAN,THE SPECIAL GROUP FOR THE NORTHEAST SUGAR AGRO-INDUSTRY. REPORT REVIEWS 1966-1971 HISTORY OF THIS SPECIAL ORGANIZATION CREATED TO MODERNIZE THE NORTHEAST SUGAR INDUSTRY,DIVERSIFY THE AGRICULTURE OF THE SUGAR ZONE,AND MODIFY THE AGRARIAN STRUCTURE THROUGH LAND REFORM AND HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT. THE REPORT FOCUSES ON USAID EFFORTS TO INTERFACE WITH GERAN AND ON THE UNDERLYING FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO GERAN'S DEMISE. PROGRAM OFFICER DESCRIBES GERAN'S COMATOSE CONDITION PRIOR TO ITS DEC 68 LEGISLATIVE RECONSTITUTION WHICH ESTABLISHED BROAD EXECUTIVE POWERS FOR THE EXEC SECRETARY,A SPECIAL FINANCIAL FUND,AND SOME IMPLEMENTATION AUTHORITY. DESPITE DIFFICULTIES IN COLLECTING ITS APPROPRIATIONS FROM SUPPORTING AGENCIES AND SUGAR MARKETING TAX REVENUES, AND WITHOUT CLEAR AUTHORITY TO EXPROPRIATE LAND IN LAND REFORM PROJECTS,GERAN NEVERTHELESS WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO GENERATE PROJECTS AND MAKE AN IMPACT AT THE TIME OF ITS ANNULMENT. PROGRAM OFFICER ATTRIBUTES GERAN'S DEMISE TO AN AUTHORITY STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE AND THE INDEPENDENT LEADERSHIP OF SEMI-AUTONOMOUS REGIONAL AGENCIES. GERAN'S PROBLEMS WERE EXACERBATED BY THE AUTOCRATIC BEHAVIOR OF ITS FINAL EXECUTIVE SECRETARY,WHOSE POLITICAL ASPIRATIONS AND ORGANIZATIONAL INFIGHTINA ALIENATED IMPORTANT BRAZILIAN LEADERS & AGENCIES AND UNDERMINED GERAN'S INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT & ULTIMATELY ITS FINANCIAL BASE. USAID'S INVOLVEMENT WAS INFORMAL AT THE OUTSET WITHLITTLE RESPONSE BY GERAN TO USAID OVERTURES AND THE MAINTENANCE OF CONTACT ONLY AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS. FOLLOWING GERAN'S1968 REORGANIZATION,USAID AND GERAN REACHED AGREEMENT ON PROJECT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. ORIGINALLY VIEWED AS MERE FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL SUPPORTS,USAID CONTRACT-TECHNICIANS WERE ABLE TO ACQUIRE INCREASING INFLUENCE WITHIN GERAN.

"EVALUATES PROJECT TO INTRODUCE MODERN TECHNOLOGY TO THE PROCESSES OF BASIC GRAINS, DIVERSIFIED CROPS AND HANDICRAFTS FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM LEVEL FARMERS IN GUATEMALA DURING THE PERIOD OF 2/23/70 TO 2/7/72. EVALUATION WAS CONDUCTED THROUGH ONSITE VISITS AND CONVERSATIONS WITH USAID AND GOG PERSONNEL. PRINCIPAL ACCOMPLISHMENT NOTED THUS FAR IS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK OF THE LOAN -- BANDESA, THE AGRICULTURAL CREDIT BANK, INDECA, THE PRICING, MARKETING AND STORAGE AGENCY AND DIGESA, THE TRAINING AND RESEARCH AGENCY. BANDESA, IT IS NOTED, THUS FAR APPEARS RELUCTANT TO DEAL WITH THE VERY SMALL HIGHLAND FARMER. IN REGIONS REVIEWED, VIRTUALLY ALL BORROWERS WERE PREVIOUS CUSTOMERS OF PREDECESSOR AGENCIES. WHILE BANDESA OUTLETS BEING ESTABLISHED AT THE SUB-REGIONAL LEVEL ARE NOT YET ADEQUATE TO REACH TARGET GROUPS OF FARMERS, THE PLANNED DISTRIBUTION, IF IMPLEMENTED, IS DEEMED ADEQUATE. IT IS NOTED THAT INDECA IS APPARENTLY RUN BY QUALIFIED PERSONNEL AND THE PRICING POLICY SEEMS CLOSELY COORDINATED WITH THAT OF OTHER CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES. PROCESSING, STORAGE AND MARKETING OF DIVERSIFIED CROPS ARE DEEMED THE MOST SERIOUS WEAKNESS IN THE PROGRAM. NO INDECA STORAGE FACILITIES EXIST IN THE HIGHLANDS, AND IT IS LIKELY THAT PUBLIC STORAGE FACILITIES WILL BE NO GREATER NEXT YEAR. WHILE THE DIGESA RESEARCHED PROGRAM IS JUDGED TO BE TECHNICALLY STRONG, THE PROMOTOR PROGRAM IN DIVERSIFIED CROPS IS EXTREMELY WEAK DUE TO LOSS OF TRAINED PEOPLE THROUGH TURNOVER. MAJOR OMISSION NOTED IN THE PROGRAM IS THE LACK OF PROVISION FOR MARKETING OF DIVERSIFIED CROPS. RECOMMENDS 1) THE FORMATION OF A JOINT AID-MINISTRY-INDECA COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER ESTABLISHING A NEW CATEGORY UNDER THE LOAN FOR MARKETING OF SUCH CROPS; 2) APPROVAL OF AN EVAL SYS FOR ENTIRE PROG TO DETERMINE EFFECT AT THE FARM LEVEL; 3) ESTABLISHMENT OF ICT AS A SEMI-AUTONOMOUS NATL ADAPTIVE RESEARCH INSTIT. ALSO RECOMMENDS ANOTHER PROGRESS EVALUATION FOLLOWING THE FIRST CROP SEASON IN LATE 1972.

"Cites the project activities & achievements to date (4/5/72) of a contract with Oregon State Univ (OSU).  Purpose of proj was to research the tropical weed control problem and disseminate findings to interested agencies & individuals.  This eval was prepared by the contractor. OSU resrch comprised the following activities:  1) new herbicide testing -- use & dosages for over 30 crops; 2) annual screening of new herbicides; 3) testing of the herbicide ""Ambien"" under tropical conditions; 4) resrch on the use of urea fertilizer as a carrier for 2,4-D herbicide for weed control in rice; 5) advanced resrch on 3 new herbicides for use with direct-seeded rice; 6) control of wood plants in Hawaiian pastures & range lands; 7) seed pelleting as an approach to herbicide selectivity in dir-seeded rice; 8) indexing of commercial herbicides for trop & temperate pasture legumes & grasses; 9) trop sorghum & corn weed control problems; 10) weed control in taro grown under paddy & upland conditions.  OSU also assisted local counterparts & their instits in weed resrch. The above resrch resulted in the prep & distrib to resrchrs of 51 publications in English & 35 in Spanish.  Some of the more important publicatns are:  an annual report in which promising new herbicides are listed for the most important crops; a series of manuals & a periodic newsletter on herbicides, applicatn eqpmnt, resrch techniques, etc; ident books on cool climate & trop weeds; the ICA-sponsored ""Weed Control Recommendation Bulletins"".  OSU also set up a computerized info retrieval sys to answer queries on weed control from USAID's agr exper stations & other interested parties.  OSU resrchrs working in Latin Amer trained 29 contrprts in resrch & utilization techniques, helped to establish & operate 12 resrch stations, and trained 8 exten weed control specialists.  A series of weed control field days was organized at various resrch facils throughout Colombia, attracting over 1000 farmers, extentionists & resrchrs.  The establishmnt of several weed control societies (eg, Colombian Weed Society, Latin Amer Weed Soc, Asian-Pacific Weed Soc) was assisted by this project.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1972 12:00:00 AM","","Tropical zone|Agricultural research|Weeds|Pest control","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAC683A1.pdf","214 KB","001396 - Oregon State University","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","KRASHEVSKI, STEFAN H.","","5 Apr 1972","","","","CONTROL OF WEEDS IN LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES -OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY","","PD-AAC-683-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc1NTQz","Technical Assistance","9310206"
"Evaluates Southeastern Asia Development Advisory Group (SEADAG) performance from 1966 to 1977 in Southeast Asia.  Project purpose is to provide an additional channel through which official US efforts to participate in Southeast Asian econ & social development could be supported by the expertise & research of academic scholars engaged in area & functional studies. Evaluation is based on consultations with SEADAG staff & questionnaires completed by SEADAG participants. It is not presently possible to know what contributions SEADAG will have in Asian development since most programs have not yet materialized. Many papers have resulted from panel/seminars. Quality of documts, performance of panel chairmen, and organizational ability of secretariat have steadily improved. Many scholars have found SEADAG an attractive forum for inquiry and exchange between themselves, and as a means of influencing the activities and policies of AID.  Although funding adequately supports present activities, it is felt that more emphasis could be placed on selected problem areas.  Frustrations in the early years of SEADAG resulted due to:  1) the constraints of Congress; 2) limited funds; 3) disenchantment of scholars with US policy, 4) lack of SEADAG's directn; and 5) frustrations in finding a congenial divergence between their expectations and the role of SEADAG.  Presently rigid time dimensions limit the performance of panel chairmen; quality of manuscripts need improvement; and the lack of communication between SEADAG and other organizatns has resulted in duplicatn of research. Recommendations are to:  1) continue activities where there is increased dialogue with Asian policy makers; 2) upgrade publicatns using outside ad hoc committees to edit & appraise manuscripts; 3) increase time in recruiting panel chairmen allowing them to visit other panel/seminar meetings & chairmen; 4) provide chairmen funds for travel to DC for briefing as to their relationship to AID & to Asia to recruit panels; 5) upgrade quality of research papers by having less meetings; 6) improve communicatn with other Asian organiztns & between AID & SEADAG.","Evaluation period: 1 Oct 1970-30 Sep 1972","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1972 12:00:00 AM","","Development organizations|Regional development|Development planning|Economic indicators|Reporting systems|Beneficiary interviews","Asia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA433A1.pdf","471 KB","003257 - Asia Society.

POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS ARE: (1)GIVE INCREASED EMPHASIS TO TITLE II AS PART OF AID'S PACKAGE OF DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE; (2)EMPHASIZE NUTRITION IN TITLE II PROGRAMMING; (3)REVISE THE ORDER OF PRIORITIES OF TITLE II TO EMPHASIZE MATERNAL/CHILD HEALTH AND DE-EMPHASIZE SCHOOL FEEDING; (4)PROGRESSIVELY SHIFT PLANNING RESPONSIBILITY TO HOST GOVERNMENTS; (5)MAKE MULTI-YEAR COUNTRY PLANS THE BASIS FOR FOOD ALLOCATIONS AMONG RECIPIENT COUNTRIES; (6)ALLOW MORE PROGRAMMING FLEXIBILITY AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL; AND (7)BRING VOLUNTARY AGENCIES MORE CLOSELY INTO THE COUNTRY PLANNING PROCESS. THE EVALUATORS ALSO MADE OPERATIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM.","V. 2: PD-AAE-019","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/CSD-3378","","7/1/1972 12:00:00 AM","","FOOD FOR PEACE Title II|NUTRITION|Maternal child health care|School feeding programs|Nutrition improvement|Health policy|Sector planning|FOOD FOR WORK","Sri Lanka|Malaysia|Philippines|Indonesia|Colombia|Dominican Republic|Morocco|Ghana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR363.pdf","25,718 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.
