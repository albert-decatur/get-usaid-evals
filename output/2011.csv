"The Transparency and Accountability Grants (TAG) program was implemented at a time when the Government of Lebanon (GOL) was struggling to combat corruption. TAG was implemented as one of the activities supporting USAIDs program strategy designed to promote and foster transparency, accountability and good governance in civil society as well as in central and local governments. TAG was conceived in 1999 and implemented in 2001 under a Cooperative Agreement (CA) between AMIDEAST and USAID/Lebanon. Although TAG was implemented as a one-year program it was extended to 10 years, until February 2011, through a series of consecutive CA modifications. Over the years the cumulative value of TAG grew from $655,000 in 20012 to $9,350,900 by February 2011. The program went through 20 CA modifications and amendments. TAG provided small grants (less than USD $50,000) to a wide range of civil society organizations and individuals that worked to promote and foster transparency, accountability and good governance. Eight organizations, however, were provided grants between $50,000 and $100,000.","Task order no. 07|Contract no. listed on document as: RAN-I-00-09-00019|Evaluated project title: Transparency and accountability grant (TAG)|'This publication .... was prepared by the staff of Performance|Management Plan for Lebanon (PMPL) project ....'","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-RAN-I-00-09-00019|RAN-I-00-09-00019-00","","5/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","","Civil society|Political corruption|Accountability","Lebanon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACR860.pdf","874 KB","011933 - Social Impact, Inc.","","000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)","English","application/pdf","Performance evaluation (2011 definition)","","","Civil society","May 2011","","","","Transparency & accountability grant project : summative evaluation final","","PD-ACR-860","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MzE3Mzkx","Lebanon",""

"The purpose of this report is to provide an independent and objective assessment of the developmental impact of the 27-year United States Telecommunications Training Institutes (USTTI) ICT training program. Established in 1982 as a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation, USTTI is a public-private partnership (PPP) between the United States Government (USG) and US-based telecommunications/ICT companies. It provides a wide range of specialized, tuition-free training to policy-makers, regulators and public- and private-sector executives and professionals from the developing world. The program has offered 1,600 individual training courses at a variety of locations in the US and graduated over 8,000 women and men representing 168 countries worldwide. From the outset, USTTI has received financial and technical support from a variety of corporate, academic and USG sources. Since 2005, USTTI has received $1 million annually from USAID, while the cumulative total from USAID since 1985 under a succession of grant agreements has amounted to $15,942,785. The Impact Assessments findings and conclusions are based on: (1) a review of pertinent documentation; (2) interviews with USAID personnel, USTTI board members and staff, representatives of USG institutions and private corporations involved in the USTTI program, and instructors/presenters; (3) an electronic survey of training participants; (4) telephone follow-up interviews with a sample of respondents to the electronic survey; and (5) visits to 11 countries to interview USTTI participants and their supervisors and colleagues. It should be noted that, due to lack of information, it was not possible to contact USTTI participants who were trained prior to 1996. Of the training recipients since 1996, 37% responded to the electronic survey. An important purpose of the telephone and site visit data collection was to explore the extent of, and potentially correct for, any positive bias in the survey response.","Title in footer: USTTI impact assessment|Commissionedd by EGAT/I&E/ICT|USAID IQC number listed on document as RAN-I-00-09-00015-00|RAN-I-00-09-00015-00","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-RAN-I-09-00015|AID-CIO-TO-10-00001|RAN-I-00-09-00015-00","","7/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","","Information systems|Technical training|Impact assessment|Public private partnerships|Telecommunications technology|Mass media","Latin America|Central and Eastern Europe|East Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACS202.pdf","27,207 KB","011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

"The purpose of this evaluation of USAID/Cambodias HIV/AIDS portfolio was to assess the performance of the current program and make recommendations to guide USAID investments in HIV/AIDS for the next five years. The scope of work specified two overarching questions: 1)How well have past Mission investments in HIV/AIDS performed? and 2)How should the Mission invest resources in HIV/AIDS during the next five years? USAID technical assistance in Cambodia has a long track record of testing potential innovations and model development, piloting and adaptation. There are numerous examples of replication and scale up of USAID-developed models. These include replication of prevention program models developed by USAID, using Global Fund monies, and the national roll-out of a continuum of care (CoC) model, based on a USAID pilot. Nonetheless, Global Fund grants have had an insufficient emphasis on technical oversight and quality assurance. USAID continues to add value beyond its own programming in these areas. USAID/Cambodia has successfully developed the technical and organizational capacity of national and community level NGOs to be major contributors to prevention and care and treatment programming. This has been critical to program success.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-442-O-00-00008","","7/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","","HIV/AIDS|Disease prevention and control|Disease treatment|Health care administration|Monitoring","Cambodia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACR999.pdf","1,453 KB","","","013626 - U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)|008523 - USAID.

"The MEASURE Evaluation Project is a Leader with Associates Cooperative Agreement, implemented by the Carolina Population Center at the University of North Carolina, in partnership with Futures Group International, ICF Macro, John Snow Inc., Management Sciences for Health, and Tulane University. The project's current phase, Phase III (August 2008 to August 2013), has a ceiling of up to $181 million, of which about $87 million to date has been obligated. The two previous phases of the project ran from 1997 to 2008. The project's development objective is ""improved collection, analysis and presentation of data to promote better use in planning, policy-making, managing, monitoring and evaluating population, health and nutrition programs."" MEASURE Evaluation Phase III is to accomplish this through achievement of the following six results related to monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) data: increased user demand for data for decision-making; increased technical and managerial capacity; increased collaboration and coordination; improved design and implementation of the information-gathering process; increased availability of data, methods and tools; and increased facilitation of use. To achieve these results, MEASURE Evaluation develops methodologies, disseminates data, builds capacity, promotes best practices in M&amp;E of health programs, and works to address country and global M&amp;E needs.","Evaluated project title: MEASURE evaluation phase III|Project title: Global health technical assistance (GH tech)","Special Evaluation","Documents","GHS-I-00-05-00005-00","","8/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","","Performance measurement|Health care planning|Documentation|HIV/AIDS|Malaria|Data analysis","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACS544.pdf","1,036 KB","011976 - QED Group, LLC","","010822 - USAID.

"In January-February 2011, USAID/Cambodia commissioned a mid-term evaluation of its health program that spans the period from fiscal year 2009 to 2013. The Program is comprised of an inter-related set of activities implemented by four USAID partners, Reproductive Health Association of Cambodia (RHAC), Reproductive and Child Health Alliance (RACHA), University Research Co. (URC) and Population Services International (PSI). The scope of the evaluation included the following areas: maternal, newborn and child health, family planning and reproductive health, water and sanitation, nutrition, infectious diseases (tuberculosis, avian influenza, H1N1); health systems strengthening, private sector health services and products, behavior change communication, and community mobilization. The review focused on the progress and issues across the program areas rather than on a detailed performance assessment of each USAID partner. The evaluation team interviewed a set of stakeholders at the national and sub-national levels, visited six of the ten provinces to view the work of the program at the provincial, district, facility and community levels, and reviewed an extensive set of documents, program performance data and national data sets.Substantial progress is evident toward establishing reliable health services, especially at the Health Center (HC) and community levels. HCs are better staffed, equipped and supplied, many with 24-hour service. There are a substantially increased number of deliveries happening in facilities, with a higher proportional rise in USAID-targeted provinces than elsewhere. Although there remains a considerable unmet need for emergency obstetric care, a 47% increase in Cesarean sections for obstetrical complications at hospitals in the USAID targeted provinces between 2007 and 2010 indicates progress. Health Equity Funds have visibly increased access to life-saving services for the poor.","Evaluation of programs implemented 2008-2013 by: Population Services International (PSI) (442-A-00-08-00001-00) -- Reproductive and Child Health Alliance (RACHA) (442-A-00-08-00008-00) -- Reproductive Association of Cambodia (RHAC) (442-A-00-08-00007-00) -- University Research Co., LLC (URC) (442-A-00-09-00007-00)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","","Maternal child health care|Care of the newborn|Reproductive health|Water sanitation|Infectious diseases|Behavior change|Access to services|Community behavior|Community mobilization|Obstetrics","Cambodia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACS539.pdf","784 KB","008523 - USAID.

"In AugustSeptember 2011, Social Impact, Inc. (SI) with sub-contractor Management Systems International (MSI), carried out an evaluation of the major components of the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Prevention Program (GEP) for the clean energy and environment office (CLEEO) of USAID/India. The largest component of this long-running (April 1995September 2011) program in India focused on reducing CO2 emissions from coal-fired thermal power plants. This GEP component was implemented in close partnership with the countrys biggest power producer, NTPC Ltd. Most elements of the program were implemented by the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) and the United States Department of Energy (DOE) through a Participating Agency Service Agreement (PASA). USAID contributed a total of $39.2 million to support GEP activities, of which $5.2 million was used for direct contracting by USAID with Louis Berger International, and $2 million for other, smaller contracts.The original objective of GEP was to reduce the volume of emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) per energy unit generated in the coal-based power sector, while increasing energy productivity and encouraging biomass fuel use in selected utilities and sugar industries. The initial phase of GEP (19952000) was composed of two components, Efficient Coal Conversion (ECC) and Alternative Bagasse Cogeneration (ABC), aimed respectively at increasing awareness, available information, and practical examples of the applicability of the state-of-the-art pollution prevention, efficient coal conversion and combustion for power generation, and industrial co-generation technologies in sugar mills. In 1999, new activities under the Climate Change Supplement (CCS) were added to the agreement with the government of India. The PASA was modified in 2003 to include several new areas (distributed generation, alternative transportation, hydrogen economy, and regulatory assistance).","Evaluation services indefinite quantity contract|Restricted ed.: PD-ACS-521","Special Evaluation","Documents","RAN-I-00-09-00019-00|AID-RAN-I-00-09-00019|AID-386-TO-10-00003|AID-386-00-10-00003","","9/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","","Clean energy|Pollution control|Greenhouse gas emissions|Energy planning","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACS522.pdf","526 KB","011933 - Social Impact, Inc.","","008557 - USAID.

"This report evaluates the performance of the Support for Trade Acceleration Projects (USAID/STAR I and STAR II) that were conducted under contract to Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) in Vietnam between 2001 and 2010 and ventures a look forward, partially based on the scope of work for the follow-up to STAR II, known as STAR+. The confluence of a unique set of circumstances created the initial demand for STAR in 2001 and gave it the impetus to propel it forward. The Government of Vietnam (GVN) adopted a new economic growth strategy in the 1990s to transition to a market-based economy and open the economy to international trade. The GVN used a bilateral trade agreement (BTA) with the United States and accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) as instruments to accelerate the transition process. The GVN requested technical assistance to facilitate revision of its commercial laws, legal procedures, transparency and appeals processes to meet BTA and WTO requirements. The GVN established an effective command structure to coordinate and direct technical assistance, backed by GVN senior political authority. USAID management granted broad operational flexibility to the technical assistance providers. USAID/Vietnams STAR Project Performance: Notwithstanding STARs enormous advantage in providing assistance to a host country government that placed high priority on legal and procedural reforms, STAR effectively delivered a large volume and variety of technical assistance typically using the same tools employed by other USAID technical assistance projects (e.g. technical experts, workshops, study tours, discussions and seminars with clients), but with greater impact. The STAR programs accomplished their objective to help the GVN satisfy BTA and WTO accession requirements.","Evaluated project title: Support for trade acceleration I (STAR I)|Evaluated project title: Support for trade acceleration II (STAR II)|Project title: Business growth initiative (BGI)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","EEM-C-00-06-00022-00","","5/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","","Trade promotion|International trade|Economic growth|Strategic planning|Market development|Economies in transition|Commercial law|Transparency|Business support services","Vietnam","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACS486.pdf","620 KB","007239 - Weidemann Associates, Inc.","","011274 - USAID.

"USAID Liberia initiated the Land Rights and Community Forestry Program (LRCFP) in December of 2007 to advance the policy and practice of land and forest management in Liberia. The program was designed to improve the legal and policy environment for community forest management, build the capacity of the national forest service and communities to develop and sustain community forestry programs and generate environmentallysustainable and equitable economic benefits for rural residents. At the national level, LRCFP supported the passage of the Community Rights Law and associated regulations, and built the capacity of the Forestry Development Authority (FDA). At the local level, the program facilitated the creation of five community forests and introduced improved livelihood practices in Nimba and Sinoe Counties. Work of the primary contractor for LRCFP concluded on October 28, 2011.The purpose of this evaluation is to assess the implementation and impact of LRCFP, identify strategies taken to adapt to evolving challenges and opportunities, and determine and report on the implications for further investment in Liberia and for USAID more broadly. A team of five specialists in agriculture, forestry, biodiversity and land tenure reviewed the available documentation and spent two weeks in Liberia engaging with national and community participants in the program. Although intense rains and time constraints limited access to community participants, the team nevertheless interviewed over 30 community representatives and 50 people total. Prior to returning to the US, the team presented initial findings to the USAID/Liberia Mission.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","10/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","","Legal rights|Land management|Land use|Forestry|Rural areas|Community leadership","Liberia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT242.pdf","1,046 KB","008570 - USAID.

"This document summarizes the status of the ICFG project at its midpoint. It considers what has been accomplished and what has been learned in light of the goals of the project. It then suggests the adjustments that that should be made to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of the project as it works to draw from experience gained, primarily in the Western Region, to detail a model for a nested governance system that addresses the priority issues for both coastal and fisheries governance in Ghana. This summary draws upon a self-assessment of the project prepared at the close of Year 1 (included in the Our Coast Our Future document), and self-assessments conducted with the projects international and Ghanaian partners in March and July of 2011. The central objective of the ICFG Initiative is to assemble the pre-conditions for a formally constituted and decentralized coastal and fisheries governance program for Ghanas Western Region that can serve as a model for the nation. As an expression of the ecosystem approach, these preconditions include: Clearly defined goals that resonate with stakeholders; Constituencies that support such goals and a plan of action to achieve them; Governmental commitment expressed as a mandate, the necessary authorities and the resources to successfully implement the program; and, The institutional capacity to sustain the initiative on into the future.","'Integrated Coastal and Fisheries Governance Initiative for the|Western Region, Ghana'","Special Evaluation","Documents","641-A-00-09-00036-00","","9/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","","Coastal fisheries|Fishery management|Fishery development|Business growth|Governance","Ghana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT294.pdf","913 KB","007437 - University of Rhode Island.

"The Millennium Challenge Corporations Immunization Threshold Program (MCC-ITP) for Peru was implemented by the United States Agency for International Development in Peru (USAID/Peru), and from October 2008 through February 201. A USAID/Peru contractor implemented the program with the goal of expanding coverage of one-year old infants who have received immunization against measles and the full series of three diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT3) vaccinations, so that immunization rates of 95% are reached in each of Peru's regions and, thus, nationally. In order to reach the immunization threshold, the MOH designed a strategy to complement the National Immunization Strategy based on three components: increased vaccination in eight target regions through use of Itinerant Brigades (IBs) to access dispersed and excluded populations, strengthened vaccine logistics such as cold chain management and the creation of a national integrated immunization information system (IIIS).","Task order #AID-527-TO-11-00001|Evaluated project title: Millennium Challenge Corporation immunization threshold program (MCC-ITP)","Special Evaluation","Documents","RAN-I-00-09-00019-00|AID-RAN-I-00-09-00019","","12/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","","Immunizations|Vaccinations","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT298.pdf","2,223 KB","011933 - Social Impact, Inc.","","000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)","English","application/pdf","Performance evaluation (2011 definition)","","Nelson, David|Schneider, Rose|et al.","Immunization","Dec 2011","","","","USAID/Peru Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) immunizations threshold program (ITP) assessment :  final report","","PD-ACT-298","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MzIwNDgy","Peru",""
"Beginning in FY 2009, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) began to fund the office of WHO in Juba to support the implementation of IDSR in South Sudan. Over the subsequent three years, each of these donors has provided approximately $1 million each year to finance: Training of surveillance staff at state, county, and payam (sub-county) levels; Training of primary health care staff in the detection and reporting of diseases of epidemic potential; Printing and dissemination of job aides and reporting forms; Procurement and distribution to surveillance staff of high-frequency radios, satellite telephones, motorcycles, and bicycles; Procurement and prepositioning emergency medical supplies, vaccines, and laboratory supplies; Operational costs of support supervision, collection of weekly surveillance reports, and investigation of suspected outbreaks; and Employment of WHO technical staff (international and national) at state and national levels. This mid-term evaluation report presents the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of a collaborative evaluation commissioned by USAID and conducted September 27 to November 2, 2011 by a team of four external consultants. The evaluation team reviewed all available documentation and data from the IDSR program and interviewed key informants in Juba and in a convenience sample of six states, nine counties, and 38 health facilities.

"The Citizen Advocacy Partnership Program II (CAPP II) implemented by the Centres for Civil Initiatives (CCI) has resulted in a number of clear impacts on the policy reform process in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH) in the area of government accountability. At the same time, the impacts are somewhat diffused in a manner that still does not add up to larger reform progress in any of the specific component areas within government accountability. Here employment policies stand out as perhaps the most coordinated set of slices of the larger reform pie. Anti-corruption efforts within CAPP II are at the other end of the spectrum and reflect a more net flinging approach.

"This report is an evaluation of the results of a five-year (20062010) democratic development program implemented under the CEPPS II mechanism by the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs (NDI) and the International Republican Institute (IRI) (collectively, the Institutes), both core grantees of the National Endowment for Democracy. It totaled $12,273,815 in USAID funding, with $7,528,815 for NDI programs and $4,745,000 for IRI programs. The program focused primarily on supporting the development of political parties in Serbia. The overall goal of the program was to support USAID/Serbia's Strategic Objective 3: Risk of Political Instability Reduced through support of key democratic structures and processes. Based on the findings of this evaluation, this goal should be considered successfully achieved. Pro-democratic forces prevailed in every election during the time period of this program, especially in the election of 2008, which brought to power a party coalition that has maintained a stable government since that time.","Task order no.

"This report on the Ambassador's Small Grants Program (ASGP) to Support Gender Equality in Afghanistan evaluates the effectiveness and design of ASGP's support for women-focused civil society organizations (CSOs).  An evaluation team examined whether and how ASGP provided opportunities for gender equality and empowerment, and if it reduced gender-related constraints through USAID-funded activities.  The team found that ASGP's goal of improving the status and quality of life of Afghan women by strengthening the capacity of women-focused CSOs was only partially met.  Larger and more well-established organizations were better able to take advantage of this assistance, and therefore they and their beneficiaries benefitted more t from ASGP grants.  Short-term awards impeded progress towards the sustainability of the organizations and the award's ability to improve the grantee CSOs' sustainability. Capacity-building implemented by consultants rather than using a participatory model created dependency rather than empowerment. Recommendations include: (1) use a small grants program model; (2) integrate gender equality into analyses and decision-making; (3) increase award and program duration; (4) begin future activities with a needs assessment; (5) emphasize transparency and accountability; support Afghan's women's movement and local NGOs; (6) link USAID programs and grantees, beneficiaries, and other USAID program partners to local government institutions; and (7) develop an internal process that would ensure collaboration among programs with similar goals and objectives, but avoid duplication.

"The Sant pour le Dveloppement et la Stabilit dHati (SDSH) Project is the U.S. Agency for International Development/Haiti (USAID/Haiti) flagship health sector activity. Awarded to Management Sciences for Health (MSH) in August 2007 for an initial period of three years (20072010) at a cost of $42.5 million, the contract was amended four times between 2007 and 2009 to increase its cost to $81.4 million, and to extend the activity to September 30, 2012.The SDSH Project builds on two predecessor projects managed by MSHHaiti Health Systems 2004 (HS 2004) and Health Systems 2007 (HS 2007)and continues the earlier activities support for the health delivery programs of (currently) 28 non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The most important new component of the project is the inclusion of a focus on 31 target zones or zones cibles (ZC)areas identified by the Ministry of Health (MOH) as seriously underserved by MOH resources. Health services available through those networks are expected to reach approximately 50% of the population by the end of the project in 2012. MSH manages the SDSH project with two subcontractors: The Johns Hopkins Program for International Education in Gynecology and Obstetrics (JHPIEGO) and the Johns Hopkins Universitys Center for Communications Programs (JHU-CCP).","Evaluated project title: Sante pour le developpement et la stabilite d'Haiti|Project title: Global health technical assistance (GH tech)","Special Evaluation","Documents","GHS-I-00-05-00005-00","","11/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","","Health delivery|Sector planning|Health care planning","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT351.pdf","428 KB","011976 - QED Group, LLC","","010822 - USAID.

"This report is the midterm evaluation of the Health Sector Financing Reform Project (HSFRP) in Ethiopia, which is a five-year, $15 million U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) financed bilateral contract to Abt Associates, Inc., to support government at the federal, regional, and woreda levels, as well as to work closely with health facilities to improve financing of health care. The project began August 1, 2008 and is scheduled to end July 31, 2013. The purposes of the midterm evaluation were to: (1) assess the performance of the project in meeting its four main goals, results, and targets; (2) identify areas of success and challenges in the implementation; (3) develop next steps and any modifications for the remainder of the project; and (4) identify opportunities for the future of the health sector financing reform efforts and develop specific recommendations for USAID and Ethiopia for the next five years. The results of the evaluation will be used to inform USAIDs and Ethiopias immediate and future program planning and implementation.","Evaluated project title: Health sector financing reform (HSFR)|Project title: Global health technical assistance (GH tech)","Special Evaluation","Documents","GHS-I-00-05-00005-00","","12/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","","Health finance|Health care reform|Financial management|Sector planning","Ethiopia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT293.pdf","722 KB","011976 - QED Group, LLC","","010822 - USAID.

"An in-country assessment of the organizational capacity-building efforts of select PEPFAR/USAID partners was conducted September 13, 2011-October 6, 2011, by a team of two independent external consultants: a USAID Washington-based capacity advisor and a pair of Ethiopia-based health systems strengthening specialists. USAID Ethiopia developed the scope of the work (SOW), provided input to the assessment methodology and the assessment instruments, and participated in the site visits. The purpose of this capacity-building assessment is three fold: Assess the appropriateness of the various capacity-building tools and approaches used by the partners; Identify the effectiveness of local capacity-building interventions; Identify potential future directions for capacity-building interventions. The assessment examined the progress being made to sustain three integrated and reinforcing components of capacity-building: individual/workforce development: institutional strengthening and system development; and resource use/management and external organizational environment.","Project title: Global health technical assistance (GH tech)","Special Evaluation","Documents","GHS-I-00-05-00005-00","","11/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","","Organizational capacity|Implementation|Local capacity building|HIV/AIDS","Ethiopia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU381.pdf","1,065 KB","011976 - QED Group, LLC","","010822 - USAID.

"Since 2006, a series of microfinance and cooperative institutions funded by USAID have been successful in delivering credit to individuals and businesses. One of these activities, the network of Islamic Investment and Financial Cooperatives (IIFCs), under the USAID funded Agriculture, Rural Investment and Enterprise Strengthening project (ARIES), was successful in delivering credit to rural and small urban centers, primarily in the North. These memberowned and managed financial cooperatives offer Sharia-compliant credit services to rural farm households and rural/urban small businesses to support improvements in their economic livelihoods and encourage savings for future household and economic activities. The individual IIFCs are managed and regulated by a national IIFC Group office based in Kabul. The Group and each IIFC has a Board of Directors, national in the case of the Group and local in the case of each IIFC that provides guidance, advice and direction for each entity. Collectively, the individual IIFCs and the Group are known as the IIFC Network.","'USAID Contract Number: GS-10F-0425M, Order Number: 306-M-00-07-00502-00, Task Order Number 2007-012'|Evaluated project title: Rural finance and cooperative development program (RUFCOD)|Project title: Services under program and project offices for results tracking (SUPPORT)","Special Evaluation","Documents","306-M-00-07-00502-00","","12/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Public finance|Cooperative management|Microfinance|Livelihood|Community centers","Afghanistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT898.pdf","1,886 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"<span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"">This performance evaluation presents documented findings that the USAID/DR-funded Dominican Sustainable Tourism Alliance (DSTA) program is making progress if somewhat delayed progress toward reaching its goal of better equipping local small, medium-sized and community-based tourism enterprises and organizations. This outcome is most notable in the nine existing tourism clusters created with USAID support under its earlier Competitiveness and Policy Project (CPP) which offers an alternative vision for sustainable tourism in the Dominican Republic (DR).Further, the evaluation concludes from these findings that the DSTA programs five-component strategy was soundly designed if at times unevenly executed for implementing a cluster approach to developing sustainable community-based organizations and micro, small and medium enterprises that can compete effectively in marketing tourism products and services, including the niche market of eco-tourism. This cluster approach has made noteworthy, if occasionally halting, progress toward achieving the DSTAs five-year life of program targets and is worthy of examination and consideration for replication in other development settings. Still, some design and implementation flaws have emerged, as has been recognized and largely addressed by USAID and DSTA implementing partners during the initial three years of Program execution. </span>","Task order no:  AID-517-TO-11-00001|Evaluated project title: Dominican Sustainable Tourism Alliance (DSTA)|V. 1: PD-ACT-994|V. 2: PD-ACT-996|Integrated evaluation report: PD-ACT-999","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-517-TO-11-00001|RAN-I-00-09-00008-00","","9/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","","Tourist industry|Small scale enterprises|Medium scale enterprises|Community based delivery|Community participation","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT997.pdf","2,037 KB","006007 - AMEX International, Inc.","","013413 - USAID.

"The FORECAST Project, implemented by the Academy for Educational Development (AED), was designed to build human and institutional capacity within Government of Liberia (GOL) ministries, public institutions, NGOs, and other organizations. The Project, which commenced in September 2008, ended in May 2011. USAID/Liberia requested that the Liberia Monitoring and Evaluation Program (L-MEP) conduct an End-of-Project Stakeholder Assessment toward the goal of making recommendations regarding whether USAID should continue to support Participant Training and Human and Institutional Capacity Development in Liberia and, if so, what the focus should be.The purpose of this assessment is to: Determine whether FORECAST has achieved its goal of increased operational effectiveness of targeted GOL ministries, public institutions, NGOs, and other partner organizations. Assess the management structure and processes FORECAST employed to determine if these were the most effective approach to implementing a human capacity project. Make recommendations to USAID/Liberia regarding whether a future human capacity development project should be implemented and if so, what areas it should focus on, and how best it should be managed.&nbsp;","Cover title|Evaluated project title: Focus on results : enhancing capacity across sectors in transition (FORECAST)|Project title: Liberia monitoring and evaluation program (L-MEP)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","669-C-00-10-00181-00|AID-669-C-00-10-00181","","12/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","","Human capacity development|Institutional linkages|Societies in transition|Economic development|Economic development|Accountability|Transparency|Worker participation|Skilled workers|Nonskilled workers|Professional training|Educational development","Liberia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU750.pdf","703 KB","008360 - Mitchell Group, Inc.","","008570 - USAID.

"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID)/Southern Africa commissioned Khulisa Management Services (Khulisa) to conduct an Education Program Performance Evaluation of the Education Support to Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC) in South Africa Program (EOVC Project). The EOVC Project was implemented by Research Triangle Institute (RTI Institute) in partnership with the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Education (KZNDOE), MiET Africa and JET Education Services (JET) from 30 April 2009 to 31 August 2011 and had an assigned budget of US$2,399,016, including cost share of US$631,007.Based on the USAID Education Strategy and the KZNDOEs Inclusive Education policy priorities, the EOVC Project was implemented in Sisonke district of KZN, South Africa to support the improvement of OVCs access, performance and retention within the system of education. RTI Internationals proposal was to address the gap between actually assessed OVC needs and the currently available supply of OVC services to improve learner attainment and retention. The project began with a very comprehensive baseline study which included a household survey and learner testing. From this documentation, a design workshop was held to design interventions. Schools were given a menu of these interventions and conditional grants to address their specific needs. When the USAID evaluation policy was launched, the USAID/Southern Africa eliminated the endline comparative survey and commissioned this external evaluation.","Title in footer: Final program performance evaluation report : education support to orphans and vulnerable children","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-674-O-11-00123","","10/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","","Access to education|Orphans and vulnerable children (OVC)|Learning motivation|Teacher training|Adult education|Educational infrastructure|Public education|Primary schools|Agricultural education","South Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU929.pdf","1,682 KB","010506 - Khulisa Management Services (Pty) Ltd.","","008605 - USAID.

"Kabeho Mwana (Life for a Child) was implemented from October 2006 to September 2011 as one of 16 USAID/Child Survival and Health Grants Program (CSHGP)-funded expanded impact projects (EIP) worldwide. It was designed to scale up community case management (CCM) of malaria, diarrhea, and pneumonia, and to promote key community-level health promotion and disease prevention actions in Rwanda. Concern Worldwide was the lead agency, and implemented in partnership with the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and World Relief. The project covered six districts in Southern and Eastern Rwanda: Gisagara, Kirehe, Ngoma, Nyamagabe, Nyamasheke, and Nyaruguru, representing one-fifth of the districts of Rwanda and 18% of the countrys total population.The project objectives included:1) Increasing access to prompt first-line treatment for young children with malaria, diarrhea and pneumonia by expanding CCM, strengthening health service delivery systems, and establishing performance contracting for CHW supervision.2) Increasing coverage of key preventive interventions by improving targeting and increasing the breadth of preventive child health services through outreach.3) Increasing adoption of key family health practices through community mobilization and social behavior change.During these five years, the Government of Rwanda (GOR) built on initial efforts at decentralization (2005) to accelerate and nationally scale its community integrated management of childhood illnesses (c-IMCI) approach. Under the governance of the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP), independent efforts of the three NGO partners had already built a positive experience in Home-based Management of Malaria (HBM). As the GOR created the MOHs Community Health Desk (CHD), it established a national policy for integrated Community Case Management (CCM). This generated both high demands on Kabeho Mwana for flexibility, and a supportive environment for achieving results.","'Gisagara, Kirehe, Ngoma, Nyamagabe, Nyaraguru, and Nyamasheke Districts, Rwanda -- October 2006- September 2011'|Title in footer: Kabeho mwana -- final evaluation","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","GHS-A-00-05-00018-00","","12/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Community development|Case management|Malaria|Diarrhea|Pneumonia|Community health care|Child care|Disease prevention and control|Adverse health practices|Community mobilization","Rwanda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACW279.pdf","1,980 KB","013093 - ICF International|010283 - Concern Worldwide","","011222 - USAID.
