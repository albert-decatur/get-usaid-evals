"To address some of the challenges created by lack of access to safe water, in 2004, the United States Agency for International Development's (USAID) Global Development Alliance (GDA) brought together Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs (CCP), Population Services International (PSI), CARE USA, and Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) to create the Safe Drinking Water Alliance (SDWA).  The general goal of the Alliance was to test three marketing models to increase demand for water treatment and to identify the potential of P&amp;G's PUR in each model as an alternative POU technology.  PUR is a household-based water treatment product that combines disinfection with removal of dirt and other pollutants and transforms turbid contaminated water into clear, potable water.  The three models tested by the SWDA included: (1) a commercial marketing model with full cost recovery in Pakistan; (2) a social marketing model where some promotional costs were subsidized in Haiti; and (3) an emergency relief model in Ethiopia. In Pakistan and Haiti a combination of behavior change communication activities and PUR-branded messages and materials were disseminated to increase the demand for water treatment and to introduce PUR.  In both countries, CCP led the behavior change campaigns, while in Haiti PSI handled the specific promotion and distribution of PUR.  In Pakistan, P&amp;G focused on creating demand for PUR.  In Ethiopia, CARE staff working in the Community-Based Therapeutic program were fully in charge of introducing PUR and providing the motivation and information for its use. In all three contexts SDWA partners also studied barriers and facilitators to sustained water treatment behaviors, as well as reactions to and use of PUR specifically.  Findings have clear programmatic relevance, and add to the emerging literature on water treatment behavior and the adoption of new technologies, and particularly provide insights about feasible directions for PUR.

"The USAID-funded Decentralized Basic Education (DBE) Project aims to improve basic education delivery in Indonesia. The DBE1component aims specifically to improve the management and governance of basic education at the level of districts as well as schools and Islamic madrasah. The purpose of this study is to describe the impact of DBE1 on schools and madrasah, as assessed in a number of studies. Throughout this report, the term 'school' is taken to include madrasah and regular schools, both public and private. Project activity commenced early 2006 in the first cohort of elementary schools; some 526 schools in 25 districts spread over eight provinces. In early 2009, after three years of project implementation, DBE1 began to conduct a comprehensive study to assess the impact of DBE1 programs to support school-based management in these schools, as reported in Chapter Two. While routine monitoring, which is reported in Chapter Three, provides evidence that suggests project outputs are having an impact in improving management and governance in schools, its main purpose is to measure project implementation performance. This present impact study, using both qualitative and quantitative approaches, is needed to better measure impact of DBE1 interventions as well as the nature of that impact and factors associated with success and failure. While DBE1 works intensively at both district and school levels and has pioneered important approaches to improving the management and governance of basic education at both, the scope of this study is confined to the level of school and community. The study is also confined for the most part to the first cohort of 526 target schools, where the program has been running for at least three years with direct support from DBE1.

"This evaluation concludes that USAID and U.S. government programs have contributed substantively toward the goal to expand the number of people that benefit from global trade through trade capacity building (TCB). Project documents detail a range of successful USAID strategies that help firms and governments meet the demands of the international marketplace, improve the policy environment for trade, and enable countries' trade and logistics systems to function more efficiently. The evaluation found U.S. assistance to be significantly associated with increases in the value of recipient countries' exports, after controlling for a wide range of factors that have influenced international trade flows over the last decade. Other investigative techniques revealed assistance synergies that can improve the results of TCB assistance. Important among these strategies is working toward more competitive public and private sector practices simultaneously. Synergies are also found in combining training, analysis, technical advice, and equipment to deliver an integrated assistance package. Further analysis revealed the critical importance of strong relations with counterparts and the coordination of assistance with counterparts' own reform processes. In short, this evaluation found that U.S. TCB assistance since the launch of WTO negotiations in 2001 has had a positive impact in developing countries. The report highlights a number of key opportunities to improve monitoring and evaluation of trade capacity building assistance. These include establishing a framework of intended USAID TCB results and appropriate measures of those results.

"The Private Sector Competitiveness Enhancement Project (PSCEP) is a $6,588,557, three year project of USAID/Azerbaijan's Economic Growth office and implemented by Chemonics International.  The project began in September 2008, and will end in December 2010, ten months earlier than originally anticipated.  USAID/Azerbaijan has commissioned this assessment both as way of judging the effectiveness and impacts of the project, and also to provide guidance to USAID's successor project (Azerbaijan Competitiveness and Trade (ACT) project) which is starting in late 2010. Although there were some design and implementation problems that will be described below, and a difficult business environment overall, PSCEP did achieve at least two major successes: improvements in the dairy sector that have brought about substantial income gains for thousands of farmers, and re-establishment of the aquaculture industry in Azerbaijan after it had declined by 90% over the past twenty years. In most respects, PSCEP follows a fairly conventional competitiveness/value chain methodology.  However, three aspects of the design and/or implementation stand out as being different from similar projects in other countries, and it does appear that these differences have contributed to short-falls in overall project effectiveness: (1) an unnecessarily complex analytical process used in sector selection; (2) too much emphasis on investment as a primary project objective; and (3) an unrealistic timeline for achieving indicators, As a result, after fifteen months of the three-year project, 62% of the budget had been consumed.  Once the sector-specific technical assistance began, it does appear that much of it was effective.  There were particularly beneficial results in the dairy sector, and aquaculture.  Other firm-specific successes were noted with green-house farming and high-value agriculture (strawberries), but because often a small number of individuals benefitted, the cost-benefit of this assistance is questionable. It should be noted that private sector economic growth is difficult in Azerbaijan, mainly because of monopolization of key sectors in the economy and a general lack of transparency.  Even a well-designed and well-run project will have difficulty achieving significant results in Azerbaijan.  In addition, the project design contained certain mandated activities and targets that affected the implementation in negative ways.  That said, it is also clear that the project fell short of achieving some of its benchmarks and targets and that the work of the implementer was not always cost-effective. Among the key lessons that can be taken from this project are: (1) the necessity of having targets and benchmarks that are appropriate for the project goals and design; (2) to realize that proper timing and sequencing of actions is essential to sound project management; and (3) to manage the use of project resources so that they are applied in the most cost-effective manner relative to project goals.

"This evaluation is of the Trade and Investment Reform Support Program in Azerbaijan (TIRSP), a USAID-sponsored initiative managed by contractor Chemonics, Inc. The Evaluation Team commends all three components of the TIRSP initiative. Component One revived Azerbaijan's path to accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Component Two responded to the Azerbaijani business community, advising on the many areas of trade and investment policy and law. Component Three educated Azerbaijanis in and outside public service with timely advice on cost-benefit analysis and macroeconomic modeling. The quality of the work reviewed by the Evaluation Team ranged from solid and competent to superb. Local counterparts largely agree. Yet TIRSP as a whole is somehow less than the sum of its parts. The issue is one of design and implementation: TIRSP was greatly, if not nearly entirely, task oriented, both in design and implementation: As designed, TIRSP conceived WTO accession and trade and investment as separate, yet related, endeavors. As implemented, Component One featured many initiatives aimed at conformity to WTO guidelines. This task orientation was transferred to Component Two and was further perpetuated by the many areas covered by the theme of trade and investment. The Evaluation Team finds that this task orientation came at the cost of policy. To be clear, ""policy"" is defined as an idea or related aids formulated by government to advance a public purpose -- in this case, trade and investment reform moving to market liberalization. Laws, regulations, and statements of government intention may all reflect policy. Policies should also come with a ""policy narrative,"" a broad-based message expressed in ordinary language and directed at the public and across government offices, in order to explain why a given policy is relevant and beneficial to the public. ""Policy objectives"" are specific anticipated goals or achievements resulting from the execution of a policy. In the case of TIRSP, the Evaluation Team finds that task-orientation created the following deficiencies: (1) absence of a clear policy narrative as to why various tasks undertaken through TIRSP would benefit the Azerbaijani economy; and (2) thus inadequate explanation of the importance of tasks, leading to a number of initiatives on law, regulation and policy that could not be completed successfully. The nature of the problem lies in project design and project implementation, both executed by TIRSP executives and USAID personnel at strategic and operational levels.

"As this report documents, the evaluation team found that Africa 2010 significantly assisted African institutions in adopting new policies and initiating and upgrading multiple interventions in health delivery.  In general it has been a positive force in technically equipping regional and sub-regional health organizations.  Moreover, its assistance has been well-received by African counterparts and their institutions. However Africa 2010's mandate is so broad -- provide technical support to AFR/SD and multiple African sub-regional institutions covering virtually all the public health areas that USAID covers -- that its input into any particular activity or institution can often be limited.

"Through the analysis and elaboration of four case studies, the external, mid-term review of the USAID/Peru Pro Decentralization Project (2008-2012) provides insight into the project's progress in contributing to the definition of national decentralization policy, and translating that policy into sub-national practice.  The review offers credible analysis on the relevance, effectiveness and impacts of the program to date and offers recommendations to inform future programming decisions and improve project performance and accountability.  The four case studies analyze Pro Decentralization's policy and institutional strengthening work in: (1) budgeting for Results; (2) the National Public Investment System (SNIP); (3) modernization of State Governments; and (4) the extent to which the Pro Decentralization Program complements the work of USAID's strategic projects and partners in Peru.

"Building on the success of the Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) as a measurement tool, many countries have begun to show interest in moving away from assessments alone and toward interventions focused on changing teacher pedagogy, and as a result, increasing student reading achievement.  Liberia, for example, began an EGRA-based intervention, called EGRA Plus: Liberia, in 2008.  The results from the EGRA Plus midterm evaluation showed very promising results on a variety of learning outcomes.  This report is an impact evaluation of the EGRA Plus program at project completion, and it presents compelling evidence that a targeted reading intervention focused on improving the quality of reading instruction in primary schools can have a remarkably large impact on student achievement in a relatively limited amount of time.

"CORE seeks to address the disparity in economic development between the conflict-affected Eastern Province and the bordering provinces of North Central and Uva, on the one hand, and the rest of Sri Lanka, on the other hand. This is accomplished through an integrated approach: (1) that extends value chains broadly and deeply into the grassroots level; (2) that gives individuals the skills and knowledge they need to participate as entrepreneurs and workers in value chains; and (3) that improves the business environment to enable value chains to achieve greater competitiveness. The reviewers believe that the CORE project is on the right track and has made considerable progress over the past year and a half. It is ready to enter a ""take-off"" stage where many of its activities should begin to succeed and achieve the results intended. They also believe that the results in the next year and a half should demonstrate that the project should be extended for the option years, but that decision should be made no later than the middle of year three. This would ensure continuity of the activities and productive relationships with the private sector if the project shows further evidence that positive results are being achieved.

"Through the analysis and elaboration of 4 case studies, the external, mid-term review of the USAID/Peru Pro Decentralization Project (2008-2012) provides insight into the project's progress in contributing to the definition of national decentralization policy, and translating that policy into sub-national practice.  The review offers credible analysis on the relevance, effectiveness and impacts of the program to date and offers recommendations to inform future programming decisions and improve project performance and accountability.  The four case studies analyze Pro Decentralization's policy and institutional strengthening work in: (1) budgeting for results; (2) the National Public Investment System (SNIP); (3) modernization of state governments; and (4) the extent to which the Pro Decentralization Program complements the work of USAID's strategic projects and partners in Peru.

"USAID's Water User Association Support Program (WUASP) has been successful in Tajikistan.&nbsp; It has met its objectives to help farmers establish water user associations (WUAs), support them to clean and rehabilitate irrigation infrastructure, and improve their productivity through training in business, water management, and good governance and democratic principles.&nbsp; Thanks to this training, WUAs are, in general, institutionally and financially sustainable organizations that are responsive to their constituencies, and can resolve water management issues.&nbsp; By overcoming the limiting factor of irrigation water, farmers have opened up more land, grown more crops and diversified their on-farm activities.&nbsp; In many ways, the role and responsibilities of WUAs are expanding.&nbsp; Given the lack of a functioning extension service in Tajikistan, the WUAs are becoming more like farm associations that look at the entire farm management cycle and tackle the problems that hinder agricultural growth.&nbsp; Many challenges remain.&nbsp; For example, farmers are under-capitalized, interest rates on loans are high, relations with district water departments can be strained due to water user fee issues, equipment for operating and maintaining irrigation infrastructure is expensive to rent or is in dire need of repair, and legislation on agriculture and water management still needs full improvement.&nbsp; Nevertheless, WUA members have a sense of purpose and unity, and are confident that they can solve their problems.&nbsp; Importantly, WUA members have taken their newly gained knowledge and skills out of the confines of agriculture into the larger arena of their communities, where farmers have applied democratic principles, business knowledge and agricultural skills to other aspects of their life.&nbsp; Such an application and expansion of knowledge and skills underscore that the WUASP-supported WUAs are grassroots organizations actively engaging in civil society.&nbsp; Their continual activities after the life of the project indicate that WUAs have a promising future in shaping the dynamics of society in Tajikistan.&nbsp; (Author abstract)","On cover: USAID | Central Asian Republics|'Submitted to: USAID/CAR'|Evaluated project title: Water user association support program (WUASP)|Project title: Integrated water and coastal rsources mnagement indefinite quantity contract II (Water IQC II)","Special Evaluation","Documents","EPP-I-08-05-00010-00|EPP-I-00-05-00010-00","","5/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","","","Tajikistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACX191.pdf","647 KB","008414 - Mendez England and Associates","","011544 - USAID.
