"Evaluates project to improve the health status of inhabitants of five northwestern departments of Honduras through full community participation in all aspects of water supply and sanitation installations.  Special evaluation covers the period 3/80-1/83 and is based on interviews with project officials, document review, and site visits. Despite good progress in preparing surveys and designs for water supply systems and in installing pit privies and water-seal latrines, implementation as a whole is far behind schedule.  Health education and promotional materials are only now being made available to health promoters, and almost nothing has been done to rehabilitate existing wells.  Construction of new wells is far behind schedule and construction of the first sewerage systems will not start until early 1983.  Very little has been done on the survey of existing rural water supply systems. A principal cause for the project's delays has been the failure of the project committee (PC), composed of a USAID/H coordinator and co-directors for each of the project's three components - the National Water Supply and Wastewater Disposal Service (P/SANAA), the Ministry of Health (P/MOH), and the Office of Health Education (P/OHE) - to function as planned.  The P/OHE has not been established and has no director, and the USAID/H coordinator has not been given a proper function, resulting in lack of communication and coordination among the three sections. Further, the PC lacks decisionmaking and executive power for solving its own problems.  These problems have been augmented by the SANAA's cumbersome administrative structure, difficulties in purchasing gasoline, tires, and cement, and a shortage of counterpart funds caused by the economic crisis of 1981. Recommendations include extending the project to 12/31/84 with generally lowered targets, designating a P/OHE project director, defining the responsibilities of the project coordinator, simplifying procedures for advancing funds and other administrative matters, and developing effective training programs.  Special emphasis is given to the need to makie a task analysis for project personnel as a basis for developing specific training programs.","Order of technical direction no. 101","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSPE-C-0080","","1/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Water resources|Distribution|Water supply|Health|Sanitation|Health education|Rural areas|Technical assistance","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAM066.pdf","1,519 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"Evaluates Title II Outreach project to enable PVO's to provide cost-effective food assistance to needy recipients in hard-to-reach areas in Africa and Haiti.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/78-8/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with A.I.D. Mission, PVO, and host government personnel. The project is achieving its objectives.  Twenty project grants to support more efficient logistic systems, better storage facilities, and various programmatic improvements have enabled Title II programs in 16 countries to increase recipients by more than 60%.  Specific grants have funded:  start-up costs for programs to reach new recipients in Haiti and Rwanda; new warehousing in Rwanda, Haiti, Upper Volta, and Sierra Leone which reduced costs related to food loss, rental expenses, and transportation needs; vehicle and repair facilities in Haiti, which eliminated dependence on commercial truckers and increased timeliness of deliveries; and transport subsidies in Upper Volta.  The cost-savings generated by these grants have exceeded the costs of the project.  In addition, by financing logistics costs, the grants have freed other monies for programmatic uses, and in some cases the grants have strengthened infrastructure for disaster preparedness.  The project has also directly supported program supervision of nutrition education and surveillance and other developmental activities.  In several countries the project has been a catalyst for improving relationships between PVO's and Missions. It is strongly recommended that the project be continued.  Other recommendations address the following constraints on the project: failure to synchronize project funding with Title II commodity levels; insufficient Mission personnel available to work with PVO's on project implementation; a 20% project limitation on support of developmental activities; the absence of a systematic approach to selecting the most needy beneficiaries; the need to subsidize food distribution to remote communities; the need for financial analyses to identify the most cost-effective logistic systems; and the need to phase-over fundings of some costs when project grants expire.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/SOD/POD-C-0264","","1/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace|Transportation|Costs|Food storage|Food aid programs|Private voluntary organizations","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM398.pdf","3,540 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates project to establish at least two autonomous regional agricultural service cooperatives in Honduras.  Evaluation covers the period 7/81-1/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with USAID/H, project, and co-op personnel, and with co-op members. Modifying a successful program in Guatemala, Agricultural Cooperative Development International (ACDI) has created two co-ops in Honduras, ""20 de Marzo"" in Morazan and ""Maya Occidental"" in La Entrada.  After 9 months of operation, both co-ops have reached or surpassed 12-month goals in membership (728 for both co-ops), number of loans (736), amount of loans ($331,023), and level of capitalization ($54,041).  Loan repayment has been nearly 100% where the agricultural cycle has been completed. Almost all co-op members interviewed reported markedly improved harvests and incomes as a result of the credit, technical, and marketing services being offered. The same people who engaged in preliminary field work are working as co-op managers and extensionists, a valuable continuity.  The project's success stems from open membership, professional management, systematic capitalization, and high repayment levels. However, extension agents and co-op managers lack formal training and experience, little documentation or promotional material has been prepared for co-op members, and more important, there is no substantial written description of the ACDI model.  The ""Maya Occidental"" cooperative is behind in overall loan repayments (75% repaid), partly due to extensions given to some producers; this area received less land in the agrarian reform than the ""20 de Marzo"" co-op, which has a 98% repayment record and is also more active in member recruitment.  A plan to have ACDI work with two co-ops from the Asociacion Nacional de Campesinos de Honduras (ANACH) appears ill-advised, as nearly all ANACH co-ops have serious management, capitalization, and repayment problems and none are committed to the ACDI model; an ACDI commitment to provide technical assistance to 15 other ANACH co-ops is also risky.  Finally, withdrawal of any of the numerous institutions or interruption of the credit/supply/marketing functions supporting the two new co-ops could prove costly to the project.  Recommendations are made to resolve these issues.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","522-0150-C-00-1006-00","","2/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural cooperatives|Credit cooperatives|Agricultural credit|Beneficiary interviews","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM400.pdf","722 KB","000238 - Agricultural Cooperative Development International (ACDI)","","008555 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish a cancer control program in Tanzania. Final evaluation covers the period 7/79-1/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project and health personnel. Many project objectives were achieved, despite the untimely death of the first project director, the subsequent departure of many project-trained personnel, and disbursement of most funds during the project's first 2 years.  Fortunately, a highly qualified, project-trained Tanzanian was available almost immediately to become project director.  The project's most impressive achievement was the institutionalization, within the Muhimbili Medical Center, of a sophisticated cancer control center capable of providing cancer diagnoses, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery.  Radiation therapy, in particular, provides a cost-effective way of caring for cancer patients without sending them abroad, a valuable alternative for poor countries. As of 12/82, 3,514 patients had been treated at the Center, and 140 physicians and other health workers per year are receiving formal training through Center programs.  Other project accomplishments include an enhanced cancer information capability through establishment of a tumor registry; participant and indigenous training sufficient to establish the Center (although understaffing remains a problem); establishment of a cancer research capability; development of a cancer control network of 14 cooperating hospitals; provision of diagnostic and therapeutic equipment; and a public education campaign. Collection of data from regional and zone hospitals has become routine, but planned epidemiological surveys and review of rural hospitals' records were dropped due to limited resources.  Project experience has shown the value of fully involving host country sponsors, early or pre-project training, and sponsorship by an existing local organization rather than a newly created one; and the need to review OPG management at least quarterly, and to support public health data collection/analysis, detection, and prevention programs as well as therapeutic ones.  Recommendations are made for follow-on activities and future funding possibilities.","Attached to PD-AAM-507","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|Cancers|Beneficiary count","Tanzania","","","008612 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the Sudanese Agricultural Research Corporation (ARC) employ a systems approach to develop improved crop, livestock, and natural resource technologies for use in Sudan's Western region.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/79-11/82 and is based on document review, interviews with key personnel, and site visits. Good initial progress has been made; administrative, support, and communications system are or soon will be in place and personnel are enthusiastic about the project's systems approach. Research is slightly ahead of schedule.  At Kadugli, where construction of major facilities is complete, scientists have conducted valuable early research on the local area and have developed, in close contact with farmers, a working knowledge of traditional farming practices.  Research programs in range management and animal production, socioeconomics, and cropping systems and agronomy are planned for the 1983/84 or 1984/85 seasons.  Research plans for the other three stations - where construction is considerably behind schedule due to factors mostly beyond the control of project architects and administrators - remain general. The major constraint to the project is a lack of experienced Sudanese staff at all levels; e.g., of the nine Sudanese scientists stationed at Kadugli, seven are scheduled to go abroad in 1983 for advanced degree training.  Poor conditions in the area make it difficult to attract good scientists and technicians; an additional problem is the lack of adequate mechanisms and personnel to maintain equipment, vehicles, and facilities. Further, the evaluators stress that the project must be sustained beyond the planned 5-7 years in order to ensure its permanent effectiveness. Twenty-four recommendations are presented relating to: project integration into the ARC and coordination with Government of Sudan institutions; project management and support, stressing the needs to delegate routine responsibilies, develop relations to other programs and institutions, and improve communications and information dissemination activities; research approach, including developing research priorities and a plan to institutionalize the system's approach within the ARC; research programs, including developing practical and relevant research priorities; and administration, especially providing incentives to recruit project staff.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Agricultural technology|Farming systems research|Agricultural research","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM508.pdf","2,766 KB","","","001799 - World Bank (IBRD)|008607 - USAID.

"Evaluates projects to provide P.L. 480 Title I and III food aid to Bangladesh.  Impact evaluation, focusing on Title III assistance since 1978, is based on interviews with Bangladesh Government (BDG) officials. The Title III program's unique policy approach provides a useful model to other countries.  The program, in concert with other donor efforts, has provided essential food suppplies at critical periods, strengthened BDG food policy planning and management, promoted private sector development in foodgrain marketing and textile production, and helped the BDG to:  increase grain production (enhancing national food security and economic stability); improve food distribution; and reduce subsidies on food distributed through ration systems.  The BDG has established a moderately successful procurement program, designed to provide sufficient price stability to allow grain producers to invest in high-yielding varieties.  To forestall price increases during lean periods, it has stockpiled grain, releasing it as needed through open market sales. Nonetheless, due to high population growth, the nutritional status of the rural poor - the overwhelming majority of Bangladesh's population - has deteriorated in absolute and relative terms.  Despite production increases, the annual gap between grain production and consumption is over 1 million tons. Bangladesh will continue to need food aid for at least another decade. Most program weaknesses have involved implementation rather than policy issues.  The procurement program has not always stimulated production (due to delays in price announcements) or effectively reached small farmers.  The open market system has been impeded by restrictions imposed by local bureaucracies.  Also, performance with respect to self-help measures has been spotty. Efforts should be made to further refine policy objectives and/or increase USAID/B's involvement in programming local currency proceeds for developmental purposes.  Key lessons learned are: (1) Title III programs require involved management as well as a learning period to work out problems, and thus should begin with simple, limited objectives; and (2) active oversight of projects financed with local currency generations is essential.","Bibliography: p. 150-155","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title III|Food prices|Cereals|Crop production|Agricultural product marketing|Cereal crops|Food for Peace Title I","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM520.pdf","7,861 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Provides final Mission report (5/77-9/82) on a project to develop the capacity of the Atebubu District Council and its supporting institutions to effectively involve the District's population in integrated rural development activities in Ghana. Although conducted 2 years behind schedule due to poor contractor performance (leading to a corresponding project extension), a Phase I socioeconomic study surveyed wants and needs of the District population, identified constraints to changes, and suggested ways to involve the community in the design and implementation of local development activities.  This study lacked specific recommendations, but did lead to Phase II pilot activities including construction and/or provision of equipment for: (1) a community maternal/child health center; (2) a rural health clinic; (3) a blacksmith workshop and cooperative (terminated early); (4) a community center for adult education and skills training (10% completed); (5) an Adinkra dye-making and cloth printing industry; and (6) fishing, poultry producer, and cassava flour producer cooperatives. Activities leading to income generation or other economic benefits succeeded best in maintaining local participation, while activities not immediately beneficial did not receive sustained enthusiasm. Projects benefiting the general population (e.g., the community health center) had to be sustained by outside individuals or groups. The project achieved only marginal success because the District Council existed in name only, with little authority to implement self-initiated programs.  An expected decentralized local government act which would have eliminated this constraint was never passed. Until such a law exists, a follow-on project is not recommended. In light of the overextension of staff and capabilities resulting from its assumption of much of the routine procurement and construction responsibility early in the project (due to the inexperience of the organizations participating in the subprojects), USAID/G recommends that Missions not try to implement projects other than as planned and not hesitate to terminate bad projects.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Decentralization|Integrated rural development|Community participation|Institution building|Limited data","Ghana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM543.pdf","169 KB","008547 - USAID.

"Provides final Mission report (3/76-9/82) on a project to strengthen the capacity of Ghanaian agricultural agencies to deliver agricultural inputs and services. Although the project was extended 3 years, construction - having been limited to seed facilities due to a lack of constrction materials - is only one-third complete.  All commodity orders had been filled, although deliveries were generally long delayed. Technical services for the seed and credit components were satisfactory and delivered on time, but delays were encountered in placing technicians from the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture for the research component. Similarly, extension efforts were delayed due to the unsatisfactory quality of the technicians initially recruited. At the purpose level, only moderate progress was made in strengthening the delivery capability of the implementing agencies.  The continued deterioration of the economic situation in Ghana caused rapid decapitalization of the working capital available for small farmer credit and made foreign exchange for purchasing inputs such as fertilizer and pesticides extremely scarce. The monitoring of project inputs is being continued in conjunction with the current implementation of the follow-on project (Phase II). Pending the 10/83 evaluation of the latter, a further follow-on with the Ghana Seed Company project may be undertaken. Lessons learned are that:  projects such as this should focus on strengthening existing institutions rather than creating new ones; a thorough appraisal of economic and political constraints must be performed at the project's outset; and special evaluation/redesign efforts should be initiated as necessary to compensate for a rapidly changing social and economic environment.","Loan no. 641-T-019","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural inputs|Institution building|Limited data","Ghana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM544.pdf","66 KB","008547 - USAID.

"Provides final Mission report (1/78-7/82) on a project to support PVO activities aimed at promoting farmer associations and rural-based business enterprises in Ghana. Progress in achieving project objectives was mixed.  Two U.S. and five Ghanaian PVO's received grants; funds were used to procure commodities (the Africa Bureau's blanket waiver to procure shelf items from neighboring countries was extensively used because of high Ghanaian prices), provide technical assistance, and sponsor participant training for 41 individual rural development activities.  Organizations assisted included bread bakers, beekeepers, fishing associations, poultry producer cooperatives, sugarcane production and processing cooperatives, and weaving and woodcarving enterprises.  Some activities had good results on a localized basis while others were dismal failures.  All activities met with some degree of failure due to the complete deterioration of the Ghanaian economy.  Several deficiencies on the part of the Ghanaian PVO's - their lack of organizational and administrative confidence, their complete dependence on A.I.D. for finances, and their inability to meet A.I.D. registration requirements - further hampered implementation and consumed an unreasonable amount of USAID/G time.  All of the PVO's were dismayed at USAID/G's unwillingness to pay overhead for general support costs.  USAID/G believes this is a valid complaint if A.I.D. wishes to increase emphasis on involving PVO's in rural development. The project taught that while PVO's can be used to promote rural development, PVO projects tend not to be cost-effective.  For future PVO projects, it is recommended that a grant be provided to a single well-established U.S.-based PVO which would register eligible indigenous PVO's and assist them in writing proposals and documenting and implementing grants. It is recommended that the USAID/G continue to loosely monitor PVO activities to observe the sustained viability of farmer associations and rural enterprises assisted; that an End of Project evaluation not be conducted; and that a follow-on project not be considered because of continued macro-economic constraints in Ghana.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Agribusiness|Private voluntary organizations|Agricultural cooperatives|Limited data","Ghana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM545.pdf","164 KB","008547 - USAID.

"To provide A.I.D. with a view of how host country policies, coupled with donor actions, have fostered vital private enterprise economies in developing countries, a study, herein presented, was made of the development history of four countries which have dramatically raised their peoples' standard of living in the last 20 years - Malawi, Cameroon, Thailand, and Costa Rica. After briefly reviewing the structural changes in the economies of the four countries, the study profiles their private sectors, noting the types of enterprises present and the linkages between them. Next, the role of markets in development and the limitations of purely market-oriented strategies are discussed and reasons for government interventions in markets listed. Finally, each country's political economy and role in the world economy is outlined. The study concludes that a free and competitive private sector is efficient in allocating resources and that public policies and donor interventions can, if wisely targeted, have a beneficial effect on such enterprises. Donors are encouraged - with some caveats - to help developing country governments facilitate the expression of creative energies within the private sector. Twenty-four case studies illustrate the report's arguments.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Economic development|Private enterprises|Economic assistance","Malawi|Cameroon|Thailand|Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL007.pdf","2,084 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates the administration by Catholic Relief Services, Church World Service (and their Dominican counterparts), and CARE of the Title II program in the Dominican Republic as of 12/82.  Special evaluation is based on workshop discussions with PVO representatives and on site visits and was intended to stimulate self-assessment by PVO's and to develop with them a process for improving the Food for Work (FFW) and maternal/child health (MCH) components of the Title II program. In regard to the MCH program, it was concluded that:  better methods are needed to target foods toward the more serious cases of malnourishment; other food resources must be found; and other activities, such as local food production and nutrition education, should be integrated into the program.  Lack of stability (e.g., product changes) in Title II food disrupts consumption patterns and creates complexities for nutrition education efforts.  Improved collaboration between the PVO's and the Secretariat of Health's nutrition program is essential, and there is a need for PVO's to share their experiences and to stress that Title II foods are supplemental, not basic, foods. Specific activities are suggested for each PVO to pursue in the future. The FFW projects have recently focused on encouraging local and organized self-help efforts, typified by farmers' associations, mothers' clubs, and community development groups.  Suitable targets for future FFW projects include maintaining feeder roads; producing basic crops; construction (e.g., housing, school, and water projects); conserving natural resources; and organizing unsettled families into stable, cooperating communities.  The need for equity in distributing FFW food is highlighted. PVO's are reassessing their relations with USAID/D and government programs and attempting to focus their resources more effectively. Their special contributions (which should be linked with but not integrated with the efforts of others) could include: focusing on areas and segments of the population not currently reached by governmental welfare or development efforts; developing innovative techniques and programs; and stimulating private, economic and social organization through technical and financial aid.","Spanish ed.: PD-AAY-789","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/SOD/PDC-C-0264","","1/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Food for Peace|Food for Work|Maternal child health care","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM532.pdf","1,593 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates project to provide family planning and maternal/child health (FP/MCH) training to African paramedical, auxiliary, and community workers.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/79-9/82 and is based on document review, interviews with project and A.I.D. personnel, and site visits. Although the project concept is sound, implementation has been weak. Only 1,500 midwives, supervisory, and tutorial personnel have been trained in-country, compared to a targeted 18,500; foreign training has been provided to mid-level staff of some countries.  The contractor - the University of North Carolina (UNC) program in International Training in Health (INTRAH) - has not invited as many African institutes and personnel to participate as would seem desirable and, although the training provided has been well-done and well-received, it has emphasized teaching methodology to the neglect of clinical FP/MCH content.  Poor trainee screening has resulted in high postproject desertion and INTRAH has not always tailored training to specific country needs. Inadequate INTRAH staff capabilities is the basic cause of these difficulties.  The 16 core INTRAH staff, while expert pedagogues, are not experienced in FP/MCH, needs assessment, or evaluation; short- and long-term planning have been weak.  Efforts to recruit health training professionals have failed due to uncertain job security and A.I.D. constraints; utilization of UNC health personnel has been minimal.  As a result, less than one-third of all trainers have been INTRAH or UNC staff; this has led to subcontracting on an ad hoc basis and a loss of continuity and coherence.  On the other hand, the INTRAH educational materials unit, which is of high quality, has prepared two training manuals and plans to analyze specific country needs.  Selection of regional training centers for East and West Africa is underway. INTRAH's routine adminstration is quite good, but better communications between units and a team approach are needed. Coordination with A.I.D. is also generally good, although budgeting and personnel problems have slowed implementation.  The A.I.D. contract is so loose as to permit INTRAH to fulfill its requirements without really focusing on FP/MCH. Recent developments indicate possibilities for achieving the original target of 18,500 persons trained.  Recommendations are made to continue support and strengthen the INTRAH project by addressing the above problems.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","3/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Maternal child health care|Family planning occupations|Medical education|Family planning","Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM564.pdf","2,671 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","000077 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report (9/79-4/82) on a project to provide dispensary and classroom facilities in the Kagara Region of Tanzania. Despite considerable logistical difficulties, especially materials shortages and remoteness of construction sites, two dispensaries (each with a staff house, pit latrine, and incinerator) and 22 classrooms were completed as proposed, lacking only some finishing touches and the fixing of window glass.  Project success is attributed largely to the dedication of regional and district development directors and the regional engineer.  The project has made educational and health facilities available to substantial numbers of rural Tanzanians uprooted by the war with Uganda.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Dispensaries|Classrooms|Building construction|Refugee relief|Limited data","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM577.pdf","50 KB","008612 - USAID.

"Provides final Mission report (9/79-10/82) on a project to establish fish ponds in selected disadvantaged rural communities in Northeast Thailand. Most project objectives were achieved.  During the first year, 10 ponds were completed; contracting problems and the rainy season delayed completion of 4 more ponds by one year.  An average of 265,000 fingerlings (provided by provincial fishery stations) were released in each pond.  Thirteen villages constructed nursery ponds adjacent to the larger ponds.  Fingerling production training took place in some villages and 2 villages had produced fingerlings by the project's end. Most ponds have been harvested once and some twice; 3 ponds have not been harvested yet due to construction delays.  Yields were low (approximately 40 kg per rai versus a projected 80 kg per rai) because ponds were not completely drained and cleared of fish; low nutrient availability also constrained yields. Tickets sold to fishermen on harvest day generated about THB Baht which was used for pond maintenance, road and school repair, and other development activities. Operations research activities, though limited by managerial and organizational delays and villager unreadiness, included a study of composted water hyacinth as fish feed, a village sanitation and health program, and a very successful combination of duck and fish ponds.  As a result of project-stimulated interest in development, one village held workshops to discuss such activities as vegetable production, silkworm raising and mulberry tree production, biogas systems, nonformal education, and fish sauce production. While project management by the Department of Fisheries was not as intensive as planned, the provinicial fisheries stations provided adequate technical assistance to villagers.  Village committees, formed early in the project, proved very effective in managing ponds and regulating water use. Lessons learned are:  fish pond site selection should be based on such factors as proximity to market towns, villagers's development experience and income levels, water flows, and soil texture; management and operations should be decentralized to the provincial level; yield projections should be based on social and technical research; and more attention should be given to operations research.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Fishery management|Fish pond construction|Community development|Limited data","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM588.pdf","224 KB","008613 - USAID.

"Cameroon's economic performance over the past 20 years, unlike that of most developing countries, has been remarkably good.  To help determine the reasons for this success, this paper examines the effects of public policies on private sector development in Cameroon. Initial sections describe Cameroon's demography and its history and review political and economic development since the country gained independence in 1961.  Next, the principles underlying Cameroon's public policies - national unity, political and social order, a mixed degree of government control of the economy, and a slow and cautious approach to economic development - are outlined.  Specific government policies and their economic effects are then detailed.  External policies are described as being nonrestrictive in regard to international payments and currency exchange, but overly restrictive in regard to commerce, especially exports.  Internal economic policies regarding agriculture, finance, and industry are shown to combine direct intervention with a laissez-faire approach.  Thus, the government limits its use of price controls and refrains from manipulating food crop production, but has controlled interest rates and promoted import substitution at the expense of local entrepreneurs.  A review of the role of U.S. and other donor assistance to the private sector shows foreign aid to be an important source of import capacity, although increasingly overshadowed by oil revenues.  It is recommended that future U.S. aid specifically support economic policies oriented toward growth.  A detailed case study of one of Cameroon's parastatals, the Corporation for the Development of Cotton, is then presented, and the Corporation's success in providing economic opportunities to small farmers without destroying their economic incentives noted. The study concludes that, while the effects of public policies on private development in Cameroon have been mixed, Cameroon's experience demonstrates the viability of a gradual, cautious approach to economic change.  More detailed discussions of select items and a 6-page bibliography citing works in French and English (1954-82) are among the appendices.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Economic development|Private enterprises|Government policy|Economic assistance","Cameroon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL004.pdf","6,500 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Although a development strategy stressing industrialization based on import substitution and participation in the Central American Common Market (CACM) has helped Costa Rica achieve growth with equity since 1960, the country is now in a severe economic crisis.  Key factors endemic to the crisis are identified in this report on the effect of public policies and supporting donor interventions on Costa Rica's recent economic and social history, with special reference to the private sector. It is found that the success of the industrialization strategy, which was due almost entirely to external opportunities, was accompanied by: (1) dependence on the export of a few traditional commodities, prices for which have recently fallen; (2) policies fostering the establishment of capital-intensive and inefficient industries to the relative neglect of agriculture; (3) the near exhaustion of import substitution opportunities; (4) heavy reliance on borrowed, often foreign, investment capital; (5) a policy bias against exports; and (6) the failure of the nationalized banking system to attract internal savings and provide adequate financial intermediation. On the social level, substantial progress has been made in such areas as education and health, but at the cost of a large and inefficient bureaucracy in which ever more resources are allocated to pay public employees, with decreased public benefit. Further, the progressively unsustainable cost of social programs has led to increased external borrowing and a huge and unmanageable foreign debt. It is concluded that:  (1) public policies, while fostering economic and social progress, failed to prepare for or adjust to adverse external conditions during 1978-82; (2) donor support, despite major positive contributions, had little effect on these policies; and (3) the private sector, especially the key industries of food processing and apparel, reacted predictably to market and public sector signals throughout the period. Lessons taught by the Costa Rican experience are summarized and private sector needs and constraints for the period of recovery spelled out.  Appendices include several statistical tables and an analysis of the impact of the CACM on Costa Rica.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Economic development|Foreign assistance|Government policy|Social development|Private enterprises|Import substitution|Industrial development|Exports","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL005.pdf","3,060 KB","000036 - USAID.

"Malawi's economic progress since independence in 1964 has been unusually rapid.  The private nonagricultural economy has developed, despite a lack of indigenous entrepreneurs; per capita GDP has grown at an annual rate of 2.9%; the government has shifted from a net dissaver to a net saver; employment in the wage sector has increased over 150%; and manufacturing output has almost doubled. Fundamental to this progress, according to this evaluation of the private sector's role in Malawi's economic development, was the government's market-oriented economic policy framework, which permitted development of private enterprise with minimal governmental interference.  Three partly private and partly public holding companies were developed, which gradually gained control over much of the private economy, while management remained generally in the hands of the expatriate firms.  An Investment Development Bank guided by expatriate personnel mobilized capital and acted as both lender and investor in new enterprises. The years 1977-81, when management was subjected to increased political influence leading to bad economic decisions, brought a downturn in the economy which was worsened by the international recession.  In the past 2 years a return has been made to less politicized management; the policy of easy credit is being revised and reorganization of the public holding companies is underway. The main lesson learned from Malawi's experience is that public policies supportive of market-oriented growth are a major determinant of economic progress.  A constructive approach includes:  (1) reliance on market forces to determine the allocation and use of resources; (2) the ability to mobilize capital (especially foreign aid); (3) a pragmatic approach to the use of foreign capital and expatriate management personnel; and (4) government efforts to create an operating environment conducive to market development and for-profit business expansion. Political interference in economic affairs will ultimately lead to noneconomically motivated decisions, often obstructing sustained economic growth.  Fifteen tables illustrate the text.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Economic development|Private enterprises|Marketing|Management|Government policy","Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL006.pdf","3,655 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Provides final Mission report (l976-82) on a project to increase income among 1,500 farm families in 10 settlements in Northeast Thailand by introducing modern sericulture technology. Accepting the findings of a 2-4/81 evaluation, USAID/T reduced the targeted number of farmers from 1,500 to 1,000 and extended the project a year to improve administration and management, training, credit and input supply, and various technical areas. At the project's end, targets had been met for trained sericulture supervisors (10/10) and exceeded for area of central mulberry plantations (1,325/1,000 rai) and number of functioning cooperatives (13/10), but shortfalls had been experienced regarding number of central and farmer old silkworm rearing houses completed (27/30 and 709/1500, respectively), area of farmer mulberry plantations (3,544/6,000), amount of fresh cocoons marketed per year (80/311 MT), and number of trained extensionists helping farmers (30/70).  The shortfall in farmer participation was due to problems in farmer recruitment, a shortage (or non-availability) of inputs, a shortage of adequately trained staff, and procedural problems in farmer selection. The project helped 544 farm families earn a total net cash income of $237,804 from the sale of fresh cocoons.  Although the average net cash income per family was only $437 against a target of $550, the income situation has improved 200% since 1978.  As a result of changes made during the extension period, it is expected that all 709 original project farmers will continue to be active.  The project demonstrated that modern sericulture technology can be transferred successfully, even to nonproject farmers, and thus showed a good potential for replication. The project taught that sericulture can benefit the poor, but not the very poorest.  It also taught the need:  for realism in designing technology transfer projects; to train Public Welfare Department (PWD) staff to identify suitable farmer/applicants among the settlers; for farmers to repay development bank loans so as to ensure continued credit for good projects; and for the PWD to effectively coordinate and monitor input by other agencies and organizations.","Loan no. 493-T-018","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Sericulture|Farm income|Technology transfer|Beneficiary count|Limited data","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM625.pdf","232 KB","008613 - USAID.

"Provides final Mission report (1977-4/83) on a project to strengthen Thailand's Department of Agricultural Extension (DOAE). The project was a success, as shown by the 1980 DOAE decision to expand from the 33 targeted to all 71 Changwats in Thailand.  As a result, pre-service training - focusing on enabling extensionists to respond to farmers' needs - was attended by more than 5,900 (vs. 3,893 targeted) people; the training also facilitated interaction between the DOAE and other Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives units.  DOAE staff were able to initiate training programs with minimal assistance; however, the ambitious training schedule negatively affected training quality. The number of village-level extension agents increased dramatically (the extensionist-farmer ratio decreased from 1:1,700 to 1:1,100).  On the other hand, recruitment of Kaset Tambons was hampered by the low number of qualified applicants, and only 2 of 5 targeted subject matter specialists were hired.  The DOAE rejected the contractor-developed monitoring system in favor of its own, which has not yet been proved. DOAE extensionists have successfully established demonstration plots on (in 1982) 75,810 farms and have identified contact (model) farmers (exceeding the project goal of one per village); the latter have been developing good relationships with extension workers, particularly with Kaset Tambons.  Nonetheless, research-extension-farmer linkages must be further strengthened.  Crop modules were developed for 5 target crops and farmer handouts were developed, but not yet distributed.  Clearly farmers are adopting new practices, especially improved seed varieties. The targeted 85% adoption rate is unlikely to be achieved, but DOAE research shows that 40% of farmers in the Northeast now turn to extension agents for problemsolving.  Other data show that contact farmer yields are 10-25% higher than the yields of others. Lessons learned are:  a full pre-project institutional analysis of all participating agencies should be required; to assess training programs, baseline data should be collected on potential trainees; expectations as to project timeframe and the personnel involvement should be realistic; care must be taken in using training techniques from different cultures; and the adoption of research results is related to numerous social and other external factors.","Loan no. 493-T-019","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural production|Agricultural technology|Agricultural extension|Institution building|Agricultural extension training","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM626.pdf","262 KB","008613 - USAID.

"Provides final Mission report (6/74-6/79) on a project to develop a national system in Kenya capable of recruiting substantial numbers of family planning (FP) acceptors. Project objectives were not achieved.  The target for FP acceptors was reduced from 640,000 to 450,000 at project mid-term, but only 310,000 were finally recruited.  While 364 of 400 planned FP service delivery points were set up, only 40% of the 950 nurses trained in FP were posted at them.  A total of 750 of a targeted 817 family health field educators (FHFE's) were trained, but were inadequately supported and supervised and did not provide the envisioned community FP outreach. Clinical officers in charge of rural health centers did not receive FP training, and the Ministry of Health (MOH) eliminated a program to train 92 supervisors for community nurses and FHFE's, leaving the supervision of FP activities to 46 already overworked provincial and district matrons.  The 17 mobile units organized were ineffective because vehicles and staff were often diverted to other health activities.  A National Family Welfare Center with 19 employees was established within the MOH, but key posts were not filled and the Center did not become influential enough to initiate a national FP program.  Inputs provided to the MOH's Health Education Unit for conducting an FP information and education program were used for other purposes.  More positively, the project led to a substantial increase in the number of clients requesting and receiving maternal/child health services. Shortfalls were due both to the lack of demand for FP services and to the inadequate quantity and quality of the MOH's FP services.  External negative factors included the lack of political support for FP, the MOH's managerial and organizational deficiencies and its lack of commitment to FP, and a socioeconomic and cultural bias toward large families. The project taught the need to:  focus on changing family size norms and attitudes about FP; appraise host government commitment to project objectives and incorporate realistic assumptions in project designs; emphasize activities designed to foster a clear understanding of population and FP issues by leadership groups; and involve several government and/or private sector agencies in FP projects.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Contraceptive acceptor characteristics|Family planning services|Delivery systems|National level|Family planning occupations|Medical education|Family planning clinics|Limited data","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM673.pdf","303 KB","008565 - USAID.

"Presents final evaluation (1977-83) of project 6600052 and mid-term evaluation of project 6600070 (6/80-2/83), both designed to develop the capacity of the Studies and Planning Service (SEP) of the Government of Zaire's (GOZ) Department of Agriculture, Rural Development, and Environment.  Special evaluation is based on document review and interviews with project personnel. Project 0052 evolved essentially as planned; a total of 55 graduate degrees were funded, 33 in the SEP's Division of Agricultural Strategy and Planning (DASP) and 22 in its Division of Agricultural Statistics (DAS).  Two-thirds of the trainees have now returned home.  Theses written in Zaire, as required by the project, have proven valuable, but some participating U.S. universities have failed to honor this requirement, which must be retained.  Training candidates for project 0070 are just now being selected. Retention of returned trainees has become a major problem - of the 33 returned trainees, only 12 work in the SEP (7 in the DASP, 5 in the DAS).  The greatest loss has been to other GOZ services, higher wages being the key factor.  To preserve the project's investments to date, USAID/Z should offer competitive premiums to deserving returned trainees, while also, in the interest of sustainability, urging the GOZ to increase salary levels. Another serious problem is that the DAS, despite the returned trainees and extensive technical assistance, has not attained the envisioned data collection and processing capabilities and so neither has produced valid quantitative data nor is capable of implementing an agricultural census.  This failure, probably due to lack of GOZ financial support for the project, has weakened research work by the DASP's Bureaus of Agro-Economic Analysis and Agricultural Planning and jeopardizes A.I.D.'s investments in the two projects.  To develop a viable data collection system (an absolute requirement), new systems of computer analysis and of logistical support are needed, along with several expatriate technicians. Other key recommendations are to increase in-country, especially on-the-job training; make the English-language training requirement more rigorous; and expand training under project 0070 to meet increasing manpower needs.","Attached to PD-AAM-671","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Agricultural policy|Agricultural planning|Participants|Agriculture|Statistical data|Professionals|Project change","Congo DR","","","003211 - Wu P'i, Inc.","","008626 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the Government of Zaire's (GOZ's) National Cassava Program (PRONAM) conduct cassava research and transfer new cassava technology to subsistence farmers.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/78-1/83 and is based on site visits and interviews with GOZ, USAID/Z, and project personnel. Good progress has been made, despite a 20-month implementation delay due to GOZ financing problems and contractor slowness in providing a project director.  Research and limited extension activities have been established at 3 of 6 targeted stations. Excellent research has been done in variety improvement, entomology, plant pathology, and farming systems.  Several potentially high-yielding, insect- and disease-resistant clones are being tested; two have been released as named varieties. Multilocational testing and on-farm trials have been the most appropriate extension activities.  Small quantities of clones have been distributed and 100 ha have been planted for multiplication of stock, including newly released varieties. Factors limiting extension have included inadequate infrastructure, compulsory crop cultivation requirements, lack of transportation and market facilities, and strained relations between peasants and Department of Agriculture (DOA) agents. M.Sc. training and training of technicians is about on schedule. One of two Ph.D. candidates (six were targeted, unrealistically) has graduated.  English-language training at the University of Ibadan has been disappointing, however, and formal local training has not begun due to delays in facility construction.  Short courses have been provided to extension participants. Institutionalization of PRONAM's research capabilities is doubtful due to lack of adequate compensation, career status, and living conditions for personnel. Project continuation is recommended, preferably as part of a broader multi-crop, multidisciplinary project, and predicated on reformed DOA personnel policies and practices.  Also recommended are greater emphasis on local varieties, socioeconomic studies to select areas for introducing new varieties and technology, and determination of a farming systems research strategy.","Attached to PD-AAM-668","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Cassava|Agricultural extension","Congo DR","","","","","008626 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help Integrated Population and Development Planning (IPDP) to increase understanding among LDC planners of the relationships between population dynamics and socioeconomic development. Special evaluation covers the period 10/79-6/82 and is based on document review, interviews with A.I.D. officials, and visits to projects in Rwanda, Senegal, and Mauritania. IPDP provides technical assistance (TA), training, and research in 22 countries.  IPDP has responded well to ad hoc and special requests, and has strengthened LDC's population forecasting and analysis capabilities. The project has helped LDC planners build demographic models, improve their country's data bases, use computers, and train demographers and statisticians.  IPDP has also conducted conferences and seminars and has sponsored research on possible solutions to population problems.  More effort is needed, however, particularly in pronatalist African countries, to help LDC agencies and planners translate awareness of population issues into effective population policies.  The IPDP staff function well as a team, although they may be overextended. In Rwanda, TA included a course in research methods, conferences in Dakar, Lome, and Baltimore, and work with the Futures Group in Research for Awareness of Population Impact on Development (RAPID) presentations. In Senegal, although family planning is a sensitive issue among the Muslim majority, a cadre of well-trained and concerned statisticians and demographers is present.  The project has benefited training and research at two national agencies.  A conference has been scheduled on population policy. In Mauritania, despite a high population growth, no population control policy exists due to perceived under-population and ethnic rivalry.  Nevertheless, population/development interactions were promoted through IPDP conferences and work on a Human Resources Planning Model. Recommendations include concentrating future activities in only 10 countries; soliciting no new research; reexamining population and development policy, especially in sub-Saharan Africa; and developing mini-courses in computer science, demography, statistics, and the economics of population.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSPE-C-0062","","2/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Economic demographic interaction|Population policy|Population planning|Population education|Demography","Rwanda|Senegal|Mauritania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM592.pdf","1,372 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","000191 - USAID.

"Evaluates pilot project to develop, under the lead of Egypt's Principal Bank for Development and Agricultural Credit (PBDAC), an improved system to provide credit and production inputs to small farmers in three Governorates.  Special evaluation covers the period l980-83 and is based on site visits and interviews with key project officials and beneficiaries. The credit component, being implemented by village banks (VB's), has been well received by farmers, many of whom were previously ineligible for credit.  Funds are being used well, especially for broiler chicken and dairy enterprises.  Lending practices are sound; loan repayment has been virtually 100%; and VB savings levels have increased.  The target of 27 participating VB's is on schedule.  Given the financial capability of the PBDAC (which, however, has not fully embraced the project) and the increasing availability of other credit funds, project extension through 1988 and its nationwide replication thereafter are recommended. Also urged, due to project success without subsidies, is the general elimination of the latter.  Problems include an inadequate project communications system, and the lack of:  a uniform credit delivery system; an improved VB accounting and management information system; and essential support staff. The farm management (FM) component has also fared well, with evidence of the introduction of a broad spectrum of improved techniques (especially block farming), increased yields of major crops, expanded farmer incomes and new farmer enterprises, and improved linkages between research, extension, the PBDAC, and farmers.  FM data collection/analysis has been weak, however. VB and extension personnel have received initial hands-on training (in part from Ministry of Agriculture and agricultural university personnel), but there will be an increasing need for formal project training and in-country training facilities are virtually non-existent. Short-term U.S. training was provided to a first group of 10 credit and FM personnel in l982. Existing facilities are in deplorable condition; an unrealistic schedule has made it almost impossible to complete Phase I construction of VB's and warehouses before mid-1984. A total of 15 recommendations are made.","AID grant no. 263-0079","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Agricultural credit|Agricultural inputs|Small farms|Farmers|Banks|Farm management|Agricultural extension|Beneficiary interviews","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM693.pdf","10,341 KB","002958 - Principal Bank for Development and Agricultural Credit|000238 - Agricultural Cooperative Development International (ACDI)","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation|Evaluation team|Social science evaluation","","Browne, Glenn G.|Feaster, Gerald J.|et al.","","28 Feb 1983","","","","Evaluation report : small farmer production project","","PD-AAM-693","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc4NDky","Egypt","2630079"
"Evaluates the nutrition/maternal child health and management training components of a project to expand primary health care (PHC) in rural Thailand.  Special evaluation, funded under project 9311010, was prepared in-country in 1/83. Pertinent strategy issues are whether the innovative fund to encourage village-level production of supplementary foods can be economically successful and whether the project is geared excessively to curative care (see below).  Key management issues are the dire need, especially at the village level, for coordination among various Ministry of Public Health (MPH) programs and the need for a monitoring system to ensure program continuity. Although the training methodology innovatively focuses on the village situation, the training itself, especially at the village level, follows a conventional lecture instead of a participatory model.  This is due to the fact that managers, not trainers, are conducting the training. Communications activities are in general on target, but an overall strategy is lacking and particular areas need improvement.  The weighing program, for example, is still being used by some health workers only to identify malnourished children, an approach that would make the program totally curative.  Further, weighing is done only quarterly instead of monthly and is done in excessively large groups, while weight charts are sometimes used only to record children's anthropometric measurements and not as a communication and education tool for mothers.  A large quantity of well-designed nutrition education materials have been produced and distributed, but further work is needed to refine their content and more use should be made of radio and television. Recomendations are to:  carry out monthly weighing and stress promotive educational activities, not just surveillance; strengthen coordination within the pertinent MPH Divisions and develop a comprehensive supervision scheme for these Divisions at the district and township levels; stress participation in the training and communications programs; develop a community-based, responsive monitoring system; and improve nutrition manpower capabilities at the provincial and district levels.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSAN-C-0209","","4/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Maternal child health care|Medical education|Management training|Primary health care|Nutrition education|Weight|Measurement and detection|Technical assistance","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAM927.pdf","351 KB","000461 - Education Development Center, Inc.

"Evaluates project to create, in cooperation with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), a Development Research and Technology Planning Center (DRTPC) at Egypt's Cairo University to provide development planning assistance to Government of Egypt (GOE) Ministries. Special evaluation covers the period 9/80-2/83 and is based on document review and interviews with project and USAID/E officials. Focus is placed on the possibility of achieving DRTPC institutional viability - in terms of fiscal status, the market for DRTPC services, and the DRTPC training and consultancy development - between 1/83 and 7/86, the end date for a project extension recently proposed by CU and MIT.  Fiscal support has come entirely from project funds, but future viability depends upon the DRTPC's ability to provide services that clients want. The DRTPC is expected to face formidable funding problems beginning in l985-86, and little has been done to identify the problem or to plan for its solution.  The DRTPC's marketing division has become increasingly successful in obtaining research contracts in the sectors of transportation, physical planning, and water resources, but has had only limited success in penetrating the key sectors of construction, industry, and agriculture.  This suggests a possible misalignment between DRTPC services and the organizational structure of its potential clients.  Good progress has been made in upgrading the technical skills of participating CU faculty, while DRTPC consultancy services have helped clients solve serious development problems and DRTPC seminars and workshops have helped GOE and industry professionals upgrade their skills.  With the DRTPC working as a successful infrastructure only for the past year, however, further progress in these areas is needed. It is concluded that institutionalization of the DRTPC will require a project extension and that the project's research and other efforts (especially in light of a managerial hiatus beyond the project's control) warrant a continuation of the project subject to recommendations made in the evaluation.  (For a summary of key recommendations, see the abstract of the accompanying PES, PD-AAM-724).","Attached to PD-AAM-724","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Universities and colleges|International cooperation|Educational networking|Development planning|National level|Technology transfer|Project change","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAM724A.pdf","2,849 KB","008539 - USAID.

"Provides final Mission report (9/78-3/82) on a project to develop the capacity of the People's Education Association of Ghana (PEA) to support village improvement activities and expand nonformal education in Ghana's Eastern Region. The project achieved its objectives.  Village life was improved through provision of piped water and establishment of a rural health clinic in one village, construction of a school block in a second village, road improvement in a third, increased availability of soap in the region, and the construction and sale of water-sealed toilets.  Six Ghanaians were trained to design and implement rural development projects and respond to community initiatives.  Technical assistance (i.e., the services of an administrative advisor for one year and a trainer for two years) was provided to PEA by the University of Massachusetts. The project also contributed to PEA's visibility, to its popularity among community leaders and local officials, and to a more competitive environment for government to work in.  The promotion of physical and income-generating projects in addition to PEA's usual adult education and literacy activities has made PEA (Eastern Region) an example for other PEA groups of what can be accomplished at the local level with minimal assistance. The main constraints on the project were inadequate staffing (due to turnover and late recruitment) and the loss of volunteer community facilitators, many of whom were teachers who departed Ghana for employment in neighboring countries.  Implementation was also hindered by incomplete documentation and PEA's inexperience in operating within A.I.D. restrictions. Nevertheless, PEA's overall implementation performance was better than satisfactory.  It is recommended that the Mission maintain passive contact with PEA to demonstrate its continuing interest.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Nonformal education|Private voluntary organizations|Institution building|Development project design|Development project implementation|Development project evaluation|Community development|Limited data","Ghana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM743.pdf","200 KB","008547 - USAID.

"Provides final Mission report (l974-4/83) on a project to construct 50 km of 4-lane highway from Jakarta to Bogor and from Bogor to Ciawi in Indonesia. A 43 km 4-lane highway from Jakarta to Bogor and a 7 km 2-lane highway from Bogor to Ciawi were completed in 6/79 during Stage I of the project, and facilities for the maintenance and repair of equipment and control devices were completed in l981.  Stage I construction reduced travel time from Bogor to Jakarta by one-half, but, due to a large increase in the amount of traffic, the old road remains as congested as ever and traffic on the new road has already exceeded 30-year projections. maintenance program is being carried out and the Government of Indonesia (GOI) has committed itself to completing 7 km of a 2-lane highway which were deleted early in the project. Stage II was funded with monies unspent during Phase I and consists of design and construction supervision for adding two additional lanes from Bogor to Ciawi and a 2.5 km spur at Gadog. Although scheduled for completion (by the GOI) by 12/31/84, only 13% of Stage II construction has been completed to date, due to numerous implementation difficulties. Lessons learned from Stage II are to carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of expending funds after project objectives have been met; avoid working with a large consortium of contractors; and build an evaluation process into the project to measure progress, review effectiveness, and determine the project's contribution toward meeting overall goals.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Road construction|Road maintenance|Roads|Transportation system design|Highways|Limited data","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM745.pdf","122 KB","008558 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to support decentralization in Egypt's 21 rural governorates by funding governorate purchase of capital equipment. Special evaluation covers the period 9/80-2/83 and is based on site visits, interviews with Government of Egypt (GOE) and project officials, and on a review of the entire procurement process. The project's Technical Liaison Group has helped governorate planners select equipment appropriate to their needs, and the project, now entering its second phase with the arrival of hundreds of pieces of road construction equipment, is contributing significantly to decentralization at all levels as equipment is used to meet real needs in districts, villages, and towns.  Initial procurement delays either have been or are being resolved, although the time taken by A.I.D.'s Office of Contract Management (SER/COM) to review bids has been increasing.  Delays in delivering equipment from the Alexandria port have presented a problem, with close to 6-month delays in distributing dozers and graders and shorter delays in distributing fire trucks to the governorates.  Difficulties were also encountered in clearing excess property shipments through the port, due to non-use of standard commercial documents and separate shipping of different parts of the same equipment. Egyptian agents of the four U.S. dealers have provided short courses in equipment use for local personnel; a major drawback has been inadequate governorate representation, primarily due to inadequate per diem payments by the governorates.  Maintenance garages have been established in most governorates; their capability varies, but is generally limited to lubrication and basic maintenance.  The project's impact has been positive both politically and on the private sector, especially by upgrading local dealers to meet equipment warranty requirements - how well they provide services remains to be seen - and through growing interaction between public users and private dealers. A total of 27 recommendations are made to:  refine procurement procedures; support institution-building by continued stress on maintenance and training; and encourage the type of project management needed to ensure the provision of adequate technical assistance and monitoring in phase II.","Attached to PD-AAM-738 (PES)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Imports|Industrial equipment|Rural development|Decentralization|Institution building|Supply management","Egypt","","","008539 - USAID.

"In response to A.I.D.'s ""New Directions"" policy, the Government of Panama and USAID/P began in 1974-75 to reorient housing guaranty (HG) projects toward the poor majority.  This report describes and evaluates the impact of the first two completed HG programs exemplifying this reorientation. In the Nuevo Chorillo Housing Cooperative Project, physical outputs, i.e., housing solutions, were surpassed, but considerable delinquency in loan repayments to the cooperative and the latter's lack of a working system to promote community development make replication of the project doubtful.  In the slum upgrading project at San Miguelito, basic infrastructure and services were provided as planned, but major revisions were made in the type and number of low-cost housing units due to weak demand and rapidly rising costs.  Evaluation of the projects' impacts on beneficiaries was extremely difficult because the program planners tended to treat physical outputs as project purposes.  The most dramatic, positive impact, confirmed by beneficiary interviews, was an improved standard of living, especially in Nuevo Chorillo. It is recommended that future HG projects:  (1) include short-term indicators of beneficiary impact (e.g., reduced population densities, time and labor savings, provision of basic services, cost-efficiency of solutions); (2) determine beneficiaries' housing preferences and seek their participation; (3) obtain data on specific low-income target groups as to their capacity and willingness to pay for alternative housing; (4) reliably calculate affordability through a full accounting of carrying costs and available household income; (5) seek more innovative cost reduction methods (e.g., less costly materials, lower construction standards, self-help construction with technical assistance); and (6) recognize that subsidies may be required indefinitely to ensure the accessibility of low-income housing. Finally, since inflation and program reorientation have reduced the number of jobs generated by the HG program, adjunct programs to provide jobs for unskilled laborers in other fields (e.g., light manufacturing) should be supported.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Low cost housing|Housing cooperatives|Building construction|Urban renewal|Cost control|Housing investment guaranty|Public services","Panama","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL008.pdf","4,293 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the Jamaican Ministry of Health's (MOH) ability to manage primary health care (PHC) and nutrition programs.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/81-4/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel. Implementation, which has diverged widely from the project's design, has lacked true collaboration among the major parties (the MOH, A.I.D., and the contractor), and has been notably hampered by Government of Jamaica (GOJ) delays in filling key middle management positions (from the Project Implementation Unit to field administration).  As a result, progress in the project's various components has been uneven.  In construction (despite procedural delays) and especially in nutrition, progress has been fairly good.  Management systems, supplies, and health information are doing well in some areas (e.g., development of computerized management information systems), mainly due to the technical work done directly by expatriates, but not in others (e.g., the inability to ensure adequate supplies of drugs and medical equipment at PHC centers).  The planning, training, and maintenance components are significantly deficient.  Further, no plans yet exist to promote community participation, an integral part of GOJ health policy which has recently been incorporated into the  project, or to further the MOH's long-standing policy to decentralize the PHC system; implementation has in fact focused on strengthening central MOH functions to the neglect of field operations, despite the readiness of parish and area staff for more responsibility.  TA has generally been of good quality, although behind schedule in manpower development; a major MOH concern is the dependence on expatriate TA even when local expertise is available. Detailed findings on individual components are included in the evaluation. Achievement of the project's purpose in the time remaining is highly unlikely.  It is recommended that the MOH and A.I.D. redesign the project in the light of current needs and activities, which in some cases extend beyond PHC, and that the project be extended, probably to a total of at least 6 years. Specifically recommended are to improve coordination by incorporating the MOH's PHC Services Unit and its new Management Services Unit into the project.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Health care administration|Primary health care","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM773.pdf","1,832 KB","","","008563 - USAID.

"Evaluates integrated rural development (IRD) pilot project in Ixchiguan, Guatemala.  Special evaluation covers the period 10/79-4/83 and is based on document review, interviews with implementors and beneficiaries, and site visits. Major external changes - including the existence of a national rather than a regional strategy committee and especially the armed strife between the military and guerrillas which has led to evacuation of PCV's and the consequent abandonment of the youth club subproject (SP), transfer of the demonstration farm to the distant Town of San Marcos (where Project Hope lacks an office), and dispersion of the local improvement committees on which project strategy was based - have hindered the project, now in its final 5 months.  Nonetheless, the project, which has been redesigned to comprise 49 SP's - 15 in health care and 34 in agriculture - in 38 villages in 9 municipalities (rather than 16 villages in one municipality), has been Guatemala's first successful experiment in IRD. The demonstration farm, complete with sanitary facilities, a vegetable garden, and a greenhouse for winter production, was completed the first year and has successfully planted a variety of crop and forage species.  In the health SP, the project has trained 144 paraprofessionals and supported vaccination and de-parasitization compaigns.  This training, along with increased farm yields and intensive zoonosis research, has improved the nutritional status of Ixchiguan residents.  On the other hand, a lack of professionals has halted maternal/child health activities and curtailed dental services. In the preventive veterinary medicine SP, 96 vaccinators were trained and 80% of the animals in 10 communities were vaccinated or de-parasitized. Information on other livestock and other SP's is also provided. The project has shown the difficulties of erasing traditional practices and of trying to implement a large-scale project with a staff of five who lack adequate transportation and, more positively, the value of using a simple, small group strategy with the target population. The project, still largely at the experimental stage, should continue in a more limited way and in accordance with the several recommendations made in the evaluation.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","520-0000-C-00-3048-00|520-0000-C-00-3049-00","","5/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Pilot projects|Agricultural production|Experimental farms|Paramedical education|Agricultural research|Community participation|Beneficiary interviews","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM794.pdf","2,304 KB","","","008550 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the capabilities of the Malawian Ministry of Agriculture's (MOA) Department of Agricultural Research (DAR) in small farm research.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/79-2/83 and is based document review, site visits, and interviews with MOA, contractor, and USAID/M personnel. Good progress has been made.  The DAR's institutional evolvement has exceeded expectations and the project has engendered awareness of the need for a national research policy sensitive to smallholders.  U.S. Ph.D. and M.S. training are being provided, respectively, to 12 (vs. 8 targeted) and 11 (vs. 25) DAR staff.  Recruitment has been difficult due mainly to candidates' low scores on qualifying exams.  Ph.D's will likely return to Malawi too late to benefit from onsite technical assistance (TA). Short-term in-country training in basic and farming systems research and inservice computer/calculator training have also been provided.  TA has been overly specialized and short-term, but has - probably wisely - emphasized institution building over immediately improved research-extension linkages (a follow-on to strengthen extension is recommended).  The lack of a horticulture specialist has jeopardized targeted outputs in this area. Farming Systems Analysis (FSA) and Agricultural Economics (AE) sections have been established within the DAR and are functioning, although with limited staff.  FSA has defined and initiated a sound research approach, which, however, is not being actively pursued.  AE has established a valuable economics data base.  While these sections have interacted with other DAR efforts, this has been the exception to the rule; much more interdisciplinary research should be occurring.  The AE, maize, livestock, and pasture research sections should be more oriented toward smallholder needs; more emphasis should be given to maize research.  The project has suffered from a lack of clear research priorities. Due in part to delayed laboratory construction, procurement is behind schedule; there may not be time to train DAR staff to use new lab equipment.  Construction is 70% completed; especially important are the Tsangano wheat facility and the Bvumbwe soils laboratory. The project has functioned well to date with rather diffuse management, but clear direction is now needed regarding resource allocation.

"Evaluates project to institutionalize a self-help rural development process in Niger's Niamey Department.  Interim special evaluation covers the period 1981-83 and is based on document review and interviews with project consultants and other personnel. Results have been mixed.  In the Technical Service Delivery System component, 7 of the 10 targeted farmer couple training centers (CPT's) have become operational to date and trainee selection criteria improved. Each CPT is operating at full capacity, graduating 20 farmer couples annually; 400 couples will have graduated by 1983.  The technical package being delivered to farmer couples, however, is only marginally acceptable for use in the project area (animal traction should not be made a necessary part of the package), although additional technical staff are being recruited for the CPT's and the Niamey Development Department (NDD) has made real progress in institutionalizing a teamwork approach to planning and delivering technical services. Although over 100 (versus a target of 50-60) village co-ops - a key project activity - have been organized, operations have remained limited; however, a strategy to move this component forward will be implemented in 1983.  A major problem has been the absence of a sound program for financing farm inputs. Although a revolving credit fund was established and 247 medium-term loans made, no short-term credit - such credit was disallowed by the Government of Niger (GON) even prior to the project - has been offered and only 28% of loan payments have been repaid on time. Two consultants have made viable recommendations to improve the situation.  A Monitoring and Evaluation Unit has yet to be made operational due to inadequate manpower, but staff additions are leading to steady progress in the women's training component. General recommendations are that:  the End of Project Status indicators be redefined in terms of institutionalizing a process rather than merely quantitative achievements; the GON and USAID/N determine post-project organizational arrangements; and that the project establish close linkages with the Agricultural Production Support Project. Included are three lengthy consultant reports and 52 specific recommendations.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Community development|Small farms|Farmers|Farmer training|Agricultural extension|Agricultural technology|Agricultural cooperatives|Agricultural credit|Education|Women|Institution building|Professionals","Niger","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM817.pdf","8,159 KB","008585 - USAID.

"The long-term impact of the model Egyptian American Rural Improvement Service (EARIS) project (1952-63), still Egypt's most successful land reclamation effort, is evaluated in this report. Alignment with Egypt's top political and developmental goals enabled EARIS to successfully reclaim 37,000 acres of lake bottom and desert land at three sites, build 13 complete and 64 satellite villages, and resettle 7,500 landless families.  A semi-autonomous structure facilitated implementation but hindered transfer of responsibility to Egypt's line ministries, while infrastructure building was unrealistic and lacked long-term planning for upkeep and recurrent costs.  The project's main accomplishment was to put needed inputs - land, water, credit - into the hands of small farmers.  Political shifts and the move to large state farms on reclaimed land prevented its replication. The 30,000 acre site at Abis was EARIS's most successful, thanks in part to the marketing, economic, and service opportunities offered by nearby Alexandria.  Today, farm income in Abis has risen dramatically, average large animal holdings have increased from 1 to 4 per household, and land values have soared; prosperity is evident.  Individual and cooperative investments have allowed farmers to intensify land use, control marketing, and process their milk and cheese.  About 25% of cropland is devoted to high-value vegetable production, and cereal crop production equals or exceeds that of the Old Lands. The two desert reclamation sites, Qoota and Kom Osheim, totaling 7,000 acres, have not fared as well.  Only a fraction of the lands' productive potential is now being used due to the large-scale withdrawal - legal and illegal - of irrigation water by spontaneous land reclamation upstream.  Some of the 1,600 settler families have abandoned their farms and many who remain depend on semi-skilled work in Cairo. The project taught that small farms on reclaimed land are financially viable and highly productive if irrigation water is assured and well-managed and farmer choice permitted and that population increases result in land fragmentation, indicating the need for a diversified economic base.  U.S. support for the project made a difference that is still felt.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Land reclamation|Land use|Population resettlement|Water supply|Water management|Irrigated land|Agricultural production|Rural areas","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL011.pdf","6,489 KB","","","000156 - USAID.

"The Small Scale Irrigation Project in Bangladesh is an example of a project which could not fail, but, due to a variety of institutional shortcomings, almost did.  So concludes this evaluation of the project, which was initiated in 1976 to provide hand tubewells (HTW's) to small farmers in Bangladesh. The project was designed to take advantage of a technology already widely accepted in Bangladesh and well-adapted to the country's climate and its high water table.  The HTW, or handpump, is simple to operate and maintain, and makes use of cheap local labor.  Most importantly, it is inexpensive, and with credit available, affordable by small farmers. Despite these positive factors, the project was plagued by problems from its beginning, mainly because its initial design failed to adequately address a number of crucial issues:  the need to import iron (lack of raw materials delayed implementation for years) for indigenous manufacture of HTW's; the exact design of the pump; production by local foundries; and, especially, the credit and distribution system. To ensure that targeted farmers - those owning 3 acres or less - were reached, a system of certification and documentation was created.  The system proved ineffective and its paperwork a hindrance.  Worse, institutional inadequacies with the credit system (along with farmer dislike of the system, which required their land as collateral) made farmers owning 3 to 7 acres the primary beneficiaries.  Such farmers are at the upper end of the landholding scale in Bangladesh. Most of these problems have now been worked out - although spare parts are hard to obtain and the credit system still inadequate - and some 180,000 HTW's are in use, primarily for irrigating a third, dry season crop which would not have been planted but for the pumps, and which is, in some cases, a cash crop.  A market has recently developed for used HTW's, making them available to the poorest farmers, those not well served by the credit system.  The HTW's have also been used to increase the supply of potable water, reducing the incidence of dysentery and stomach ailments.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigation|Small farms|Farmers|Pumps|Tube wells|Agricultural credit|Distribution|Delivery systems","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL010.pdf","2,199 KB","","","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop a computerized model as a tool for health planning in LDC's.  Evaluation covers the period 1979-83 and is based on document review and interviews with A.I.D. and academic specialists. Unlike the traditional epidemiological approach to planning, this Health Sector Resource Allocation Model introduces an econometric planning strategy, to help national health planners in LDC's analyze the relative merits of various resource allocation strategies.  Developed at the University of Michigan (UM) on a large research mainframe computer using Fortran, it can also be used with Basic on a small portable computer.  The model can run health effects calculations for 30 diseases, for numerous interventions or combinations of them, at various budget levels, in a matter of seconds.  At UM the model has proved its capability as a training tool for technology transfer. Lack of disaggregated, systematically gathered data in LDC's is a principal constraint, with cost data deficiencies a severe handicap. The model will help to sensitize LDC health managers to the need for many types and qualities of planning data.  As these data normally begin to be available at the provincial level, deployment of the model at the regional as well as the national level is indicated.  It should be used initially as a tool not so much for planning as for training and motivating health planners to rely on empirical observations and to think about health alternatives in economic as well as epidemiological terms.  Core training packages appropriate to each LDC audience would be most effective. The value of the model for furthering A.I.D. health goals was to be tested in Indonesia and Egypt.  Several applications of the model technology have been completed in Indonesia, but despite the enthusiasm of many Egyptians who have studied at UM, most USAID/Cairo officials are doubtful of the model's value for health planning in Egypt and it has not yet been applied there. A fresh presentation of its capabilities and potential could lead to better rapport between the Mission and the UM team.  The situation in Egypt is promising for piloting a health planning technology transfer, with two concerned government agencies headed by strong well-qualified leaders; a collaborative pilot program to test a core curriculum is recommended. Other recommendations are to: continue upgrading the technology at UM; adapt the model for use with a variety of hardware and in a variety of computer languages; and upgrade health sector data and information management systems of LDC's.","Bibliography: p. 63-67","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","OTR-0082-C-00-2316-00","","4/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Simulations|Computers|Alternative health delivery services|Health care planning","Egypt|Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM841.pdf","7,494 KB","000430 - University of Denver.

"Provides final Mission report (dated 3/29/83) on a project to promote agricultural development in Indonesia's Aceh region by constructing and reconstructing farm-to-market roads and by training Indonesian contractors as roadbuilders. Only 126 km of the total of 318 km targeted were completed.  A.I.D. funding for Section I, Tapaktuan to Kruengluas, was withdrawn following a price dispute between Bina Marga, the Government of Indonesia's (GOI) road agency, and the original contractor, and funding was withdrawn for Section III, Kutacane to Blangkejeren, after 28% completion because Bina Marga reduced design standards to an unacceptable level.  Funding for Section II, Kruengluas to Sidikalang, was terminated 5/31/82 after 91.08% completion.  Laudably however, the GOI has or is in the process of completing the project as designed with its own funds, despite a 150% increase in total costs.  Technical assistance contracts were terminated at the same time construction funding was cut off, following the training of only one resident engineer and the partial training of three engineers at Bina Marga.  More positively, the project resulted in the evolvement of two first class highway contractors now working successfully elsewhere in Indonesia without expatriate help.  Although lack of a baseline study will make it impossible to quantify the project's benefits, visible increases can be seen in the building of new homes, commercial enterprises, and farm structures, and in farm commodity traffic on the roads. The project taught that it is extremely difficult and time-consuming to make construction contractors out of building contractors; it took 2 full years to gear up to begin road building, and another 5 years to build 212 km of road.  Contributing factors were the area's remoteness, bad weather, lack of skilled personnel, low wages, and insufficient funding.  In regard to the latter, the project taught that a conventional FAR (Fixed Amount Reimbursement) agreement based on the completion of self-sustaining subprojects is not a satisfactory method of disbursing A.I.D. loan funds for a roadbuilding project.  No such subprojects were produced during the project's first 3 years, so no loan funds were disbursed.  Even after the disbursement method was tied to contractor invoices, a total of $642,000 had to be deobligated.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Farm to market roads|Road construction|Technicians|Technical training|Institution building|Limited data","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM843.pdf","225 KB","008558 - USAID.

"Provides final Mission report (dated 3/83) on a project to help the Government of Guyana and its Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) improve and expand the capabilities of the Guyana Seed Program. Some, but not all, project objectives were achieved.  The seed conditioning unit, quality control laboratory, and storage room at the central agricultural station at Mon Repos were upgraded, and a corn elevator, portable sprinkler irrigation system, and seed treater were provided.  The laboratory is now the best equipped in the Caribbean, and seed testing is carried out on a regular basis.  The sprinkler system permits irrigation for seed production of some 10 acres during dry periods.  In addition, improved operational policies and procedures for seed production, processing, and storage were instituted; U.S. seed technology training was provided to two M.S. candidates (the second due to complete training in 5/83); short-term U.S. training was provided to one laboratory technician, and a 3-week in-country training course provided to 17 seed workers. However, none of four planned seed satellite centers were constructed due to:  a 6-month delay in technical assistance input because of contract approval delays; lack of MOA design expertise and failure of the MOA to request timely assistance; misunderstandings concerning construction plans; inflated construction costs; and failure to supply electric power at two sites.  In addition, the National Seed Subcommittee, to be responsible for formulating seed production/supply policies, is not operational.  The Subcommittee was established and made a good beginning, but following the resignation of its first chairman and unsuccessful attempts at legalization, no meetings have been held. Lessons learned are:  due to poor coordination between the MOA and other agencies, delegation of authority to lower levels was insufficient; whenever equipment is ordered, spare parts should also be ordered; construction of satellite centers should have been spread over a longer period with high-priority centers receiving initial attention; farmers should be encouraged to participate in seed research and evaluations and contracted to grow certified seed; and provision of free or heavily subsidized seed creates disincentives to invest in a seed program.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Seeds|Seed testing|Distribution|Limited data","Guyana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM846.pdf","102 KB","008553 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to assist Foster Parents Plan International (PLAN) to construct wells and water supply/sanitation systems in the vicinity of Yogyakarta, Indonesia.  Special evaluation covers the period l981-11/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project staff and beneficiaries. PLAN has constructed 442 wells, 14 community gravity water systems, 7 water storage tanks, 689 latrines, and 42 public bathhouses. Indirectly, PLAN has assisted nonclient families by providing construction drawings and technical advice for water supply and sanitation systems.  Some 14,500 families have been helped to improve or protect their water supply.  Most surveyed beneficiaries reported that they now had more water than before (64%) and that the water was cleaner (78%) and easier to obtain (82%). The data, while weak, suggest that the wells have had greater impact on income in areas with long seasonal droughts and greater impact on health in areas with adequate year-round water supply. The PLAN project has been particularly strong in promoting community involvement; all activities are implemented by community members and wells tend to be used and maintained. Latrines are not used as much as they should be, however, especially in less densely populated areas, and community educational activities have been quite limited to date. Mindful of this, PLAN staff are developing training packages for water and sanitation and translating them into Javanese, and are also developing slide shows. From a technical perspective, water system planning was minimal, largely due to PLAN selection criteria and to staff limitations. Cracks were observed around one well apron, and one site lacked spring water storage, but most wells met construction standards and all 18 handpumps were operational.  Gravity water systems, however, had design deficiencies in their water treatment function and in their positioning, and rainfall catchment systems lacked directional control over runoff and were improperly used by villagers.  There were no major bathhouse construction problems, but water from the bathhouses could be a potential health problem. Recommendations are made regarding planning, project management, education, community participation, and technical features.","Order of technical direction no. 117","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-DSPE-C-0080","","5/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Wells|Water supply|Health|Sanitation|Water use|Water treatment|Water quality|Technical assistance|Beneficiary interviews","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAN197.pdf","4,778 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"Evaluates subproject component (of an irrigated perimeter improvement project) to adapt irrigation wells for domestic use in Central Tunisia. Special evaluation, prepared 11-12/82, is based on inspection of 6 improved and 2 unimproved springs and a sample survey of 89 households. A total of 20 springs have been improved thus far.  Although the construction of the six improved springs ranged from excellent to having relatively few faults and although spring flow was generally strong, five of the springs revealed similar design deficiencies which placed major burdens on the women collecting water - narrow collection site, high placing of the drain, and poor access to the spring and into the collection area.  Further, most of the springs are on private land (three on a single holding).  One of the unimproved springs is totally unused, prompting the question why it has been scheduled for improvement. Due to the small sample size, interviews revealed no significant effects on child health from the improved springs, but several other differences did emerge.  People with an improved spring engaged more frequently in water-related activities and tended to carry out these activities at home.  Further, those with an improved spring, especially women, tended to think of access to water and water drawing as easy. Because of the survey's limits, more detailed studies, based on comparisons according to users' perceptions regarding access to water, ease of drawing water, and distance from the springs, are recommended. Also recommended are the technically simple modifications that would rectify the above-related deficiencies in the springs and the inclusion of improved springs in future irrigated perimeter projects.","Order of technical direction no. 120","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSPE-C-0080","","5/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Water supply|Rural areas|Springs (water)|Natural resource utilization|Household surveys|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method|Limited data","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAN211.pdf","802 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"Provides final Mission report (9/77-10/82) on a project to upgrade the capability of the University of Ghana's (UG) Population Dynamics Program (PDP) to promote population education, training, and research in Ghana and other African countries. Although extended beyond the original 6/79 termination date, the project, follow-on to a regionally funded project never subjected to hard scrutiny, reached few targets and the PDP's reputation, enhancement of which was a key project objective, has been called into question. Only one of two planned international symposia took place (in Monrovia) - although two seminars were held at the UG - and only four of six planned demography research projects (costs of which rose due to inflation) were awarded (to the Universities of Benin, Togo, and Ife, Nigeria).  Only one of eight targeted regional monographs was produced. Research efforts seem to be individual academic exercises of little public value; the Government of Ghana does not actively utilize PDP research findings. Due to poor economic conditions in Ghana, many of the eight (versus six targeted) participants receiving long-term U.S. demography training have been permitted to remain in the United States to pursue even higher degrees, despite vigorous USAID/G protests.  It is doubtful whether the six still studying will return to Ghana, thus obviating the project objective of building up a trained UG faculty.  In other areas, only four Ghanaians and three non-Ghanaians (of 15-20 targeted) received scholarships to the UG, and less than 10% of the funds to obtain services of the University of North Carolina was employed. A major problem was the lack of administrative expertise by the PDP Program Director, a self-styled academician who traveled throughout West Africa and Europe and left an inexperienced assistant in charge of a drifting program.  Moreover, researchers (also academics) did not comply with A.I.D. voucher regulations, and no annual and few trip reports were submitted. The key remaining issue is the submission of final receipts and vouchers from the West African research subcontracts.  The major lesson learned is that academics cannot be relied on to administer programs in accordance with A.I.D. regulations.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Research centers|Demographic research|Universities and colleges|Limited data","West Africa|Ghana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM901.pdf","288 KB","008547 - USAID.

"Current interest in small enterprise development reflects a felt need to understand the 20-30 year heritage of efforts to promote this sector, so that future programs may have optimum effects. Based on a review of literature and field practices, this paper records and analyzes evidence regarding effective small enterprise programs. The author explores, in turn, definitions of the small enterprise sector, the effects of definition on the project design and evaluation process, and the question of project impacts on firms, individuals, and communities.  He concludes that research on small enterprise interventions, though limited, suggests that such programs can increase employment and enhance income among the poor, encourage efficient use of capital, and promote integrative linkages throughout the economy. The effects of specific programmatic (e.g., credit provision, the use of financial intermediaries) and external (political, institutional, social, and psychological) factors are considered next.  The variety of factors considered is seen as suggestive of major differences in the emphases of past projects.  Assumptions and evidence relating to each factor are reviewed and assessed, and observations regarding the possible advantages of one type of approach over another in particular settings are made.  The primary purpose of the analysis, however, is to organize factors for the use of evaluation teams. Finally, to further clarify the various diverse assumptions about what makes small enterprises work, three fundamentally different approaches to enterprise development - resource transfer, psychosocial motivation, and community-building - are identified and evaluated.  It is suggested that awareness of these categories can provide evaluators with a sensitivity to the large range of alternative assumptions about project inputs and sequences as well as to all possible project outcomes. Appended are a comprehensive list of development indicators appropriate for small enterprise projects and a 7-page bibliography (1954-82).","Bibliography: p. 53-59","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Private enterprises|Development project evaluation|Development program evaluation|Development strategies|Small scale enterprises|Economic development","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL013.pdf","1,693 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase and disseminate root-knot nematode knowledge and initiate crop protection practices in LDC's.  Special evaluation covers the period 1/80-2/83 and is based on document review and a visit to project headquarters at North Carolina State University. Project accomplishments have been impressive.  The international communications network established among agricultural scientists is outstanding and interaction with the International Agricultural Research Centers has improved, especially regarding resistance research. Publications have been excellent; practical identification guides for use by LDC biologists and nematologists were published based on morphological and chromosomal studies carried out on over 1,000 populations of root-knot nematodes assembled from worldwide sources. The germplasm screening program seems to lack clear goals - some work is redundant and techniques need to be streamlined to facilitate rapid rejection of non-resistant accessions and retesting of promising and resistant strains.  Screening the germplasm of major food crops should be emphasized. Little progress has been made in developing cropping systems for nematode management; research should focus on a wide variety of crops and eschew the unrealistic objective of establishing economic thresholds for individual crops.  LDC cooperators - who must be carefully selected - should be visited by a traveling cropping systems specialist who would impart methodological consistency to studies. They should also be provided editorial assistance in producing extension materials based on their research; that they have already benefited from training is evidenced by improved field reports.  A recently discovered Peruvian soil fungus found to be effective in destroying nematode eggs requires more testing before being distributed to cooperators.  The finding of a specific interaction between certain Meloidogyne incognita and M. arenaria populations that leads to a breaking of resistance is of great significance, but falls outside the project's scope and should be funded separately. It is recommended that emphasis be put on resistance screening, crop sequencing evaluations, and support to cooperators in producing extension materials, and that provision be made for the maintenance of the project's collection of Meloidogyne populations.","Attached to PD-AAM-932","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Nematodes|Pest control|Information networking|Plant genetics|Varietal research|Plants|Pathology|Crop pests|Crop diseases|Technical assistance|Limited data plus","","","","","","000180 - USAID.

"Evaluates status (5/83) of the surveillance and chemotherapy components of a malaria control project (MCP) in Pakistan.  Special evaluation is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project implementors and beneficiaries. Regarding surveillance, the lack of reliable epidemiologic data to guide operations is hampering MCP effectiveness.  Although laboratories function well and health facility utilization is high, 70-80% of cases are not being detected, primarily due to lack of coordination with other health programs.  Mortality data and data on patients' age/sex distribution in particular are lacking.  Rates and indices (e.g., the annual parasite index and the slide positivity rate) are not computed for all administrative levels (especially villages), nor are these indicators used to plan vector control or drug intervention; attention to entomologic data has also been insufficient.  Laboratory backup in most instances is good, despite extremely limited supplies and failure to provide training and materials for slide collection to health facilities.  The understaffed and inefficiently operated active case detection home visit program is overburdened with the impossible task of detecting, monthly, all fever cases in a population of 12-30,000, as well as such duties as geographical reconnaissance, activated passive case detection, treatment, overseeing of spraymen, and coordination of supplies.  Dissemination of malaria data should not be limited to annual reports and community participation in malaria control should be promoted.  Realistic and objective MCP targets must be set. Regarding chemotherapy, a variety of drugs and treatment schedules are used in different areas, both for presumptive and radical therapy, creating confusion and uncertainty as to whether patients are properly treated.  Chloroquine is the drug of choice. MCP use of drugs containing pyrimethamine is inappropriate because resistance develops rapidly and could extend to other drugs; the problem is particularly serious in Punjab and Sind where P. falciparum is gaining strength (fortunately only 2 cases of suspected chloroquine resistance have been found).  In some areas, mass drug administration is being given without epidemiological justification. Detailed recommendations are made.","Pt.

"Evaluates contraceptive distribution by the Guatemalan Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare (MSPAS) through its National Pharmacy (NP) as part of an integrated family planning (FP) project.  Special evaluation covers the period 4/80-5/83 and is based on document review, interviews with A.I.D. and host country personnel, and site visits. The FP program lacks a clear organizational structure.  MSPAS is being reorganized, and responsibility for project management and international TA has been transferred to a new department; the latter, however, has not established a separate FP unit. Revelatory of this situation, interviews with doctors in charge of the MSPAS health districts showed that many do not view FP as a public health program nor as something promoted by MSPAS and some of those recently appointed have only vague ideas about contraceptive goals for 1984.  Minimal use of health promoters to distribute contraceptives and the lack of remumeration to midwives for promoting FP are further negative factors. The number of active contraceptive users served by MSPAS has decreased since 1978.  This seems due to a deterioration in MSPAS services; a lack of promotion at the community level, of contraceptives of all kinds (especially of DIU and T-Copper-Coils), and of supervision at all levels; distrust of the NP's cost-free contraceptives; and an increase in voluntary female sterilizations.  The NP's own distribution of contraceptives to 11 designated health areas has been deficient due to insufficient stocks at the NP itself, the fact that supplies have been distributed according to a numerical criterion instead of real need and demand, and the NP's lack information on the latter.  The recent introduction of contraceptive request forms has not eliminated notable discrepancies, largely because of a lack of understanding of the forms. More positively, direct distribution of contraceptives by the Asociacion Pro-bienestar de la Familia (APROFAM) to health centers and posts in 11 health areas is efficiently run.  Distribution rose during 1981-82 but fell to 1978 levels in 1983; actual dissemination to users was not determined by the evaluation. Development of a consolidated FP program is the chief among the 15 recommendations made.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","520-0000-C-00-3056-00","","5/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Contraceptive distribution|Beneficiary count|Project change|Limited data plus","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM966.pdf","1,719 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Onsite evaluation","","Salcedo, Danilo V.","","May 1983","","","","Consultancy to conduct evaluation on distribution of contraceptives by the National Pharmacy of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, Republic of Guatemala : final report","","PD-AAM-966","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc5MjI1","Guatemala","5200263"
"Studies the impact of the program of the Badan Kredit Kecamatan (BKK), supported by A.I.D.'s Provincial Area Development Project in Indonesia.  The program, which operates at the village level in 486 of Central Java's 492 subdistricts under supervision of the Regional Development Planning Body and the provincial government, is designed to supply low-cost credit to the rural poor for income-generating activities. A random survey of 662 representative BKK clients at 20 BKK units showed that BKK loans have promoted the expansion of most borrowers' businesses and have helped about a fourth of BKK clients begin new activities.  Loans were used mostly as working capital.  High loan repayment rates indicate that most borrowers are using the loans well. The loans have also helped reduce unemployment moderately. The program has contributed significantly to village and area development.  Local impact has primarily been through suppliers of BKK clients, most of whom are petty traders and handicraft workers, and through BKK clients' increased purchasing power. The program is far from fully servicing the province's demand for rural off-farm credit, however, and forward linkages have not been significant, nor have BKK clients passed their cost-savings on to consumers.  The program has its greatest community impact in areas where it is used for district-wide development. Although the BKK program is financially and administratively self-sustaining, A.I.D. technical assistance should be continued to improve program administration, develop a small industry loan window, and improve the voluntary savings program.  Other problems to be addressed are the revival of those BKK units - 33% of the total - which are barely functioning or have closed; the addition of new village posts; diversification and expansion of the BKK loan portfolio; and the attraction and retention of high caliber personnel. The program's success depends on its blend of political support and accountability, decentralized operations, skilled supervision, convenience and low cost to clients, a socially cohesive setting, and a moderately expanding economy.  The absence of any one of these factors could doom efforts to replicate the program elsewhere.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DS-C-OTR-0016","","5/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Credit|Subsidies|Financial institutions|Rural areas|Business enterprises|Small scale enterprises|Technical assistance","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM974.pdf","2,836 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"The West African Rice Development Association (WARDA) was created in 1970 to increase rice production in its 15 member countries via research and training activities.  This study evaluates the impact of a 1975-80 A.I.D. project aimed at helping WARDA define and attain these goals. Of the project's two research programs, only the mangrove rice program at Rokupr, Sierra Leone, produced important and still circulating results.  This was due to its longer history as a research station, its financial and administrative independence, better communications with local farmers, and strong scientific leadership. The deepwater/floating rice project at Mopti, Mali, on the other hand, proved an undisciplined effort without significant result.  Overall, and due in part to the separation of technological and economic policy solutions in its charter, WARDA's impact on regional rice production has been very limited and imports are higher than ever.  WARDA's current AID-supported collaboration in upland rice research - neglected so far, although it has the greatest potential - may help reverse this situation. WARDA also established a training center next to Liberia's Agricultural University at Fendell for students from member countries; graduates of the rice production course in particular have been an stimulus to rice growing competence in the region. U.S. training provided to key WARDA researchers has been without impact, since no trainees have yet returned, but a rice economics study undertaken with Stanford University's Food Research Institute has given important new scope to WARDA's interdisciplinary research. The project taught that donors should share common priorities with research organizations and that regional research organizations should be freed of excessive administrative burdens and helped in defining collective strategies and in improving - not substituting for - inadequate national scientific systems. Overall, WARDA's sensitivity to the political and administrative environments in its member countries makes it effective in exercising quality control and providing advisory backup services to research undertaken in its member countries.  Several specific recommendations for WARDA action are included.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Rice|Agricultural research|Agricultural training|Farming systems|Agricultural education|Institution building","West Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL012.pdf","4,289 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish a replicable primary health care (PHC) in four areas of Somalia.  Special evaluation covers the period 6/79-4/83 and is based on document review, interviews, and site visits. Progress has been seriously hampered by the underqualification of many of the contract staff, including the Chief of Party (COP); lack of communications facilities and of regular communication among the Ministry of Health (MOH), USAID/S, and the contractor; and weak USAID/S management, especially its failure to prepare a commodity procurement plan.  Responsibility for the latter was transferred in 11/82 from USAID/S to the contractor and orders have now been placed, although no extraordinary steps have been taken to remedy this long-standing situation.  The recent establishment of technical review and project coordinating groups with the MOH may be a first step towards resolving communications problems. Although 199 PHC trainers and workers have been trained, PHC curricula developed by the contract team have not been standardized and often consist of a topical outline; the team did not conduct the planned needs assessment and was unaware of an MOH document outlining curricula and job descriptions for various classes of health workers.  Four training manuals have been developed, but need to be edited and adapted to Somali conditions.  In the construction component managed by USAID/S, work has not yet begun on the 64 targeted PHC Units (although all should be completed by the end of the project), but is proceeding at the national PHC training centers at Baidoa and Burao.  The MOH's renovation of 16 district health centers is still being discussed. In other areas, the contractor has prepared two papers to help the MOH conceptualize the PHC system, but has not yet discussed with the MOH the important task of delivering health services to nomads and has been ineffective in helping the MOH develop management support systems.  Also lacking are adequate field supervision and follow-up of trainees. Despite these problems, the foundation of a PHC system has been laid and a 2-year project extension, focusing on development of the two national training centers, hiring of a new COP, and revising training curricula, is recommended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Medical education|Primary health care|Pilot projects|Rural areas","Somalia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN024.pdf","994 KB","","","008604 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to upgrade the capacity of the Panamanian Applied Agricultural Research Institute (IDIAP) to adapt modern agricultural technology and disseminate it to small farmers. Special evaluation, conducted by consultant and IDIAP personnel, covers the period 10/78-7/83 and is based on document review and site visits. Crop research at eight priority sites (criticisms of the Divisa and David facilities are included in the report) is progressing well. Experimental- and, especially, farmer-field trials have yielded improved maize-bean, potato-potato, and tomato cropping systems, new pepper and pumpkin varieties, and valuable information on, inter alia, golden nematode control, liming of soils high in exchangeable aluminum, and food grain response to changing production practices.  Grain yields on small, mechanized farms are expected to increase moderately, but little has been done to develop improved technologies for labor-intensive, subsistence farming.  Information dissemination, which has led to a high (80%) acceptance of the three improved cropping systems noted above, is accomplished mainly through farmer-IDIAP contacts, without participation by the Ministry of Agricultural Development (MIDA).  The proposed research-cum-transfer methodology is being implemented, especially in programs supported by the Institute for Tropical Resources (CATIE) and the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT). In livestock research, IDIAP has formed a staff of 50, but they are largely inexperienced, have not formed multidisciplinary teams as planned, and lack sound program formulation and data collection procedures.  Livestock research, which has focused on pasture improvement, animal nutrition, and beef and dairy cattle production, is considerably behind crop research, and further staff training is needed if integrated farming systems programs are to be developed (even though, overall, IDIAP has increased its technical staff to 150 against a target of 95, despite government budgetary constraints). Collaboration with national and international research institutes has advanced well except in regard to the key linkage with MIDA. Recommendations to improve the project are included.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","IQCPDC1406-I-16113400","","7/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Agricultural technology|Agricultural extension","Panama","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN072.pdf","2,370 KB","002664 - U.S. Dept. of Agriculture.

"Evaluates project to help Panama's Directorate of Renewable Natural Resources (RENARE) promote watershed management (WM). Special evaluation covers the period 1979-83 and is based on interviews, document review, and a site visit. Progress has been impressive, especially in developing RENARE's institutional capablities by the addition of 84 professionals and 203 subprofessionals, although contrary to project design more were placed in the central office than in the field.  Earlier problems of financial management and procedure are no longer major impediments.  However, budget uncertainties and frequent leadership changes within RENARE still hinder project implementation. The benefits of TA to RENARE have been limited due to contracting delays, lack of contractor qualifications, and the way the TA was used; a new long-term TA contractor is recommended and future consultants should work with RENARE's top leadership in the area of natural resource planning and administration.  Participant training of 45 people (42 of whom have returned) in 16 different courses has strengthened RENARE's technical competence and esprit de corps, especially within the Department of National Parks and Wildlife, while on-the-job training has improved financial management of the A.I.D. loan.  Due to resource constraints, little progress has been made in the education and research component; a large-scale natural resource education program and acquisition of aerial photography or remote sensing data are recommended. RENARE has taken a strong step toward introducing integrated WM to local farmers and herders in programs in the La Villa and Caldera watersheds.  Community participation has been strong in both programs, but weak in the Canal watershed, even though the latter has received the lion's share of loan support. Coordination of WM activities with other public and private entities is recommended, as is the protection of parks and streams rather than reforestation, which in the Canal watershed has not been cost-effective. USAID/P project management neglected overall managerial and programmatic support and its attempts to hasten implementation were counterproductive.  Recommendations to improve USAID/P management during an extension of the project, also recommended, are made.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","525-0191-C-00-3020-00","","6/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Management development|Institution building|Natural resource management|Watersheds","Panama","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN073.pdf","3,074 KB","001600 - Associates in Rural Development, Inc.

"Presents final evaluation (9/80-8/83) of a grant to World Relief Corporation (WRC) to improve development work by indigenous and expatriate evangelical development support groups (DSG's).  Evaluation, prepared by an outside consultant, is based on interviews, field trips, and WRC reports. The grant furthered WRC's entry into development work and strengthened WRC's skills and its commitment to the material and the self-help side of development.  Early WRC reliance on 3-day workshops and small projects was misguided, but WRC quickly learned from its mistakes. WRC adopted a new approach, focused on institution building, which produced the beginnings of a network of evangelical DSG's with good potential for development impact. Impact on indigenous DSG's seemed high in relation to grant funds expended.  The Sri Lanka Evangelical Alliance Development Service (LEADS), incorporated in 3/83, already exhibits great promise and has taken steps that make independent institutional survival likely (although a program strategy and related plans are still lacking), while grant-funded workshops and technical assistance helped Philippine Relief and Development Services (PHILRADS) broaden its exposure to alternative training models and establish an impressive counterpart relationship with WRC.  Current dialogue addresses the critical question of whether PHILRADS should, unlike WRC, implement development activities, e.g., its current five-village project among B'laan tribes in Mindanao, and not just support them. Lessons learned are:  (1) donor funds for small projects should be used mainly to build up local institutions and establish their credibility, not as a substitute for the local income-generating capacity needed for survival; (2) church and missionary groups offer a promising vehicle for development provided they resolve the tension between their capacity to motivate and to reach remote, deprived groups and their frequent lack of the technical skills needed to render effective assistance; (3) A.I.D. grants to PVO's should stress flexibility and innovativeness; and (4) WRC's collaboration with counterparts provides a model for other PVO's, with success depending on acceptance of counterpart agendas, restraint in using money to command assent, and sensitivity to the danger of cultural arrogance.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Institution building|Limited data plus","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAN440.pdf","695 KB","","","000088 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the Government of Guatemala (GOG) develop a statistical base for use in planning integrated rural development. Special evaluation covers the period 1-12/82 and is based on document review, site visits, interviews with GOG agency personnel, and a statistical review of project-generated data. Major objectives were not achieved.  Consonant with a project revision caused by changing GOG concerns and other factors, four studies - including inventories of infrastructure and services and of the natural resources and related economic potential of 209 rural municipios, an analysis of travel patterns in regard to access to goods and services, and a survey of local participation in development projects - were completed.  However, problems arising from the lack of statistical support in sample design, survey methodology, and data processing made data obtained of little use.  Sampling procedures essential to ensuring data validity and reliability were not used; important variables such as prices, employment, and local farm conditions and practices were omitted; and variables were insufficiently detailed.  Survey questionnaires were redundant and poorly printed, and survey operations of low quality and hampered by political violence and unrest.  The complexity of the questionnaires made data processing difficult; also, proper data entry procedures were not followed and machine editing of the data was insufficient.  Current data storage arrangements make access difficult, and documentation of the data processing system is inadequate. Shortfalls were due to inadequate TA and to conflicts between the contractor and the GOG implementing agency.  Problems were also caused by delays in:  counterpart availability; commodity delivery; contractor arrival; in-country data processing; and in paying staff salaries. Lessons learned for future survey research projects are the need to: identify and define variables early on and match them to analytical needs; include potential database users in project planning; design survey questionnaires to meet data needs and to simplify data processing; and utilize survey methodologists and practitioners. Four recommendations are made for USAID/G to facilitate the use of project data.","Attached to PD-AAN-088","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Statistical data|Information storage and retrieval systems|Development planning|Rural development|Baseline studies|Data collection|Data analysis","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAN088A.pdf","980 KB","","","008550 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to test the effectiveness of a universal soil classification system, soil taxonomy, as a vehicle for transferring agrotechnology in the tropics.  Special evaluation covers the period 4/79-12/82 and is based on site visits and discussions with host country and project personnel. Project objectives were achieved.  A methodology for evaluating technology transfer models was developed and soil taxonomy was demonstrated to be an effective basis for agrotechnology transfer. Graduate training was provided some students and workshops were held for soil scientists.  Extensive data were collected on meteorological conditions, soil temperature-moisture, cropping systems, nitrogen-fixing trees, and fuelwood production.  Professional staff in host countries were introduced to soil taxonomy, and support staff became better acquainted with the scientific process.  In addition, the institutional development of the University of Hawaii's College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources was enhanced. Project activities had a substantial impact on host country agricultural administrators and technical personnel, who are enthusiastic about agrotechnology transfer and interested in participating in the planned follow-on project.  Agricultural research agencies in Cameroon, Indonesia, and the Philippines plan to incorporate soil taxonomy in their programs. It is recommended that:  A.I.D. and other entities begin using soil taxonomy as a basis for agrotechnology transfer; project findings be widely disseminated, especially in scientific journals, and testing and data needed to further evaluate agrotechnology transfer be identified; host countries obtain detailed soil maps of project sites and surrounding areas; future studies of soil taxonomy and agrotechnology transfer include analyses of the spatial variability of key soil properties; the evaluation of the project include its considerable spinoff benefits; the relationships among groups involved in agrotechnology transfer in host countries be charted; databases be established to store project data; and brief summaries of project results for three soil families be prepared.  Additional specific recommendations are made.","Attached to PDAN-122","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Soil research|Soil types|Technology transfer|Technical assistance","","","","000180 - USAID.

"Evaluates Water and Sanitation for Health (WASH) project to provide technical backstopping of A.I.D. water supply and sanitation activities. Special evaluation, focusing on the major contractor (Camp, Dresser and McKee - CDM), covers the period 8/80-2/83 and is based on document review, visits to 7 LDC's, surveys of Mission personnel, and interviews with LDC, A.I.D., CDM, and other development personnel. WASH has provided timely and effective TA to 9 A.I.D. Bureaus, 49 Missions and Offices, the Peace Corps, and several PVO's. Further, it has responded to 1,706 requests for information from A.I.D., produced more than 15 training aids for use by operational-level LDC personnel, and conducted numerous training programs.  In most (not all) cases, TA scopes of work have been well-defined and appropriate consultants have been assigned; WASH disaster assistance in 3 countries was especially valuable. Most consultancies have a training or personnel development component, and stress community participation.  WASH training staff are effective, dedicated, and knowledgeable, but training activities have not been as varied as they might have been. Moreover, CDM has, as a matter of policy, unreasonably turned down requests for assistance in urban areas. Technology transfer activities have focused on developing handpumps. Progress in this area has been slow due to design problems and poor AID/W planning, and insufficient attention has been given to other types of water supply equipment and to solid waste and sanitation technologies.  While most WASH technical reports have been impressive, a few have included inaccurate or outdated information, others were not pertinent to the problems they were to address, and others included typographical and/or syntactical errors. Key recommendations are to continue the project through the UN Water Supply and Sanitation Decade (1981-1990); increase emphasis on sanitation, technology transfer, and long-term preinvestment assistance; and make A.I.D. project management less directive and more collaborative.  It is also suggested that A.I.D. staffing throughout the water and sanitation sector be increased and that consideration be given to transferring the WASH model of rapid, flexible, technical backstopping to other sectors.","Related to project evaluation summary: PD-AAP-221","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","8/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Water supply|Sanitation|Technology transfer","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN234.pdf","794 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","000186 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop the capacities of the Philippine Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and of Central Luzon State University (CLSU) and the University of the Philippines at Los Banos (UPLB) to improve small farm production and marketing. External final evaluation covers the period 1977-1983 and is based on document review, interviews with project personnel and beneficiaries, and site visits. Despite major external changes (e.g., reorganization of the MOA and the reduction of its policy function by creation of the National Food Authority) and loose coordination, the project was a moderate success. Key achievements in the national policy thrust included upgrading the MOA's Policy Analysis Staff (the sustainability of which remains questionable) and the Bureau of Agricultural Economics's statistical capability, and MOA progress in addressing production-marketing linkages. In the academic thrust, 15 CLSU faculty, 81 UPLB faculty, and 65 UPLB students received graduate training; nondegree training was given to 13 CLSU faculty, 76 farmer leaders, 251 government professionals, and 19 cooperative workers.  New academic programs were established in agricultural marketing, agribusiness management, and related areas. In the technical thrust, on-the-job experience helped CLSU staff develop 28 technical agricultural packages, 10 of which are ready for dissemination.  However, the farmer adoption rate of CLSU packages has been less than 5% so far and the packages seem more appropriate to large than to small farmers.  CLSU's controversial research and marketing food and feed grain processing centers will be completed later in 1983; a rigorous feasibility study before beginning operations is strongly recommended. The extension/outreach thrust successfully demonstrated the ability of the training and visit system to help local MOA workers implement agricultural development programs.  A new thrust initiated in 1981 to integrate all four project thrusts in small area settings shows promise but needs further testing. Lessons learned are the need in complex projects for:  a strong Executive Committee; involvement in project design by all agencies involved; and viewing such projects as learning experiences for the implementing agencies.  Recommendations in all project areas are included.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural production|Agricultural policy|Agricultural technology|Agricultural extension|Agricultural education|Teacher training|Universities and colleges|Institution building|Small farms|Farmers|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN277.pdf","1,359 KB","008592 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the Government of Jamaica (GOJ) develop its capacity to plan and manage energy programs, especially in energy conservation (EC) and alternative energy (AE).  Special evaluation covers the period 9/81-5/83 and is based on document review and interviews with GOJ personnel. The project, delayed for 8 months by organizational and staffing problems, is now proceeding relatively rapidly.  Future success is threatened, however, by a serious lack of capable, experienced personnel due to inadequate salaries for professional staff (averaging 63% below those paid by private sector and statutory organizations), absence of a career path, and failure to delegate authority to midlevel managers. These problems have led to a constant staff turnover (almost 90% of project trainees have said they intend to leave).  Moreover, choice of trainees has been haphazard, and overlapping authority between the GOJ Energy Division (ED) and the Project Implementation Unit has caused intense friction, which has been exacerbated by the disparity in remuneration between the two units.  It is vital that ED acquire the stature and capability to deal with major energy policy issues. Data collection for energy planning (completion of sectoral energy demand surveys and monitoring of the petroleum price structure) is proceeding well, but a stronger analytical thrust is needed.  Good progress has been made in both EC and AE, but prioritization of activities is badly needed and both components may be threatened by a funding shortfall.  In EC, 23 audit contracts (18 completed) and 6 retrofitting contracts have been let, a cadre of qualified auditors is being developed, and national EC planning has begun.  In AE, solar water heaters have been designed, installation has begun, and 20 installers have been trained; the GOJ has not yet removed the tax on solar water heaters - a condition precedent to Phase II.  Other AE elements - development of standards, establishment of the AE Demonstraton Center and the Solar Energy Institute, the forestry program, and the assessment of other indigenous AE sources are all actively underway. Numerous detailed recommendations, key among them that A.I.D.

"Evaluates project to promote cooperation between Egypt and Israel in marine technology.  Special evaluation covers the period 1979-3/83 and is based on document review and interviews with A.I.D., Egyptian, and Israeli officials and project personnel. Despite formidable political obstacles, professional relationships were established between Egyptian and Israeli marine technology specialists and a basis for further cooperation and research was developed.  Because of pressure from the government and from friends and colleagues, as well as the threat of a blacklist by Arab League countries, Egyptian scientists did not visit Israel, invite their Israeli counterparts to visit Egypt, or publish jointly with Israeli's. As a result, Israeli scientists, with American participants providing essential brokerage services, took the initiative in arranging contacts and visits in and out of Egypt; specialists from the two nations met several times in large groups and more frequently on an individual basis, and exchanged written reports through third parties. Research achievements, which were also constrained by political factors, fell short of unrealistic targets.  Nonetheless, scientific results were significant, although more progress was made in Israel than in Egypt, where scientists were constrained by low salaries, a cumbersome bureaucracy, and a history of isolation from Western science. Valuable information was generated by studies on biological productivity in the southeastern Mediterranean, coastal management and shore processes, lake management, fish nutrition, pond management, tilapia culture, and integrated aquaculture.  In addition, scientists' research capabilities were considerably strengthened. Despite the project's accomplishments, there were indications that participating scientists were more interested in obtaining funds and working with American experts than in building Egyptian-Israeli scientific ties.  Prospects for further cooperative activities, which came to an almost complete halt after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, depend on continued U.S. support of the project.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","NEB-0150-C-00-3015-00","","3/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Fisheries|Fish|Agricultural research|Oceanography|International relations","Egypt|Israel","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN290.pdf","1,023 KB","001355 - George Washington University","","000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation","","Pollack, Herman|Idyll, Clarence P.","","Mar 1983","","","","Evaluation : cooperative marine technology program for the Middle East","","PD-AAN-290","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc5OTI3","Near East Regional","2980160"
"Evaluates project to help develop a network of community-based Primary Health Care Unit's (PHCU's) to cover unserved rural and nomadic populations in Sudan.  Special evaluation covers the period 1976-3/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with Ministry of Health (MOH) and other key officials. Progress has been made in the four provinces studied; the project was well planned, receives strong MOH and international support, and is well accepted by the rural and nomadic populations. Ascertainment of the exact number of people served by PCHU's is almost impossible because data on population density and location are scanty and unreliable. However, an estimated 75% of the targeted rural population is already being reached, based on the original ratio of 1 community health worker (CHW) per 4,000 people, or 19% according to revised ratio of 1 CHW/1,000 people. Active community participation was noted in all four provinces in:  recruiting and selecting CHU candidates; discussing local health problems; constructing and maintaining PCHU's; and providing assistance to CHW's. Constraints impeding the program have included:  the 1981 decentralization and regionalization of the government in Sudan; stringent financial limitations, especially for foreign currency exchange, due to the current financial crisis; weaknesses within the managerial-supervisory component of the MOH infrastructure, including brain-drain to neighboring oil-rich countries; inadequate distribution of health personnel; and problems of transport, communication, and commodities (e.q., drugs at the PCHU-level are in particularly short supply, with virtually no anti-malarials available). Unplanned effects have included:  an imbalance between the two program components, preventive/promotive activities (now largely neglected) and curative (strongly emphasized); a change to a vertical health program from the originally designed umbrella-type administrative structure encompassing other activities such as maternal and child health, immunization, TB control, and malaria; and a change in the village perception of the CHW as a community member promoting healthful conditions to a health provider representing government. Extensive recommendations are included.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Rural populations|Alternative health delivery services|Nomadic populations|Community health workers|Beneficiary count","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN291.pdf","8,091 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","000186 - USAID.

Project targets were met.  Two highway bridges were constructed and opened to traffic in 3/79, and 70 km of rural track were improved to the level of all-weather road - 45 km from Makthar to Ech Choucha by 7/22/80 and 25 km from Rohia to Jmilet by 5/82. The project helped the target group considerably improve their income level (the lowest in the Siliana Governorate); led to expansion and improvement in subsistence farming; and facilitated the execution of Government of Tunisia (GOT) potable water and primary health care projects in previously inaccessible areas. Project facilities were also used by the GOT during its efforts to improve education and increase the literacy rate and to provide essential services in reinforcing technical assistance to integrated rural development activities in Central Tunisia.

"The history and varied impacts of the P.L. 480 Title I program in Egypt (reinstated in 1974 following a break in 1967) are assessed in light of Government of Egypt (GOE) policies and food needs. Also assessed is the program's impact on U.S. objectives. Major conclusions are:  (1) To the extent that it reduces the cost of food imports essential to the GOE's policy of ensuring a plentiful supply of cheap bread, Title I supports policies that act as disincentives to farmers (despite evidence that improved technologies could increase production by 50%); 1967-74 data support the inference of a disincentive effect.  Population growth and other pressures, however, may force the GOE to improve domestic production; options for doing so are presented.  (2) Wheat distribution by the Ministry of Supply tends to strengthen the Ministry's control over all elements of the food distribution chain, possibly making it difficult to reorient the system - which has eliminated or severely reduced regionally centered private marketing and processing of wheat and wheat flour - toward increased local production.  (3) General data (it is almost impossible to disaggregate Title I wheat from the total supply) show that daily per capita caloric intake has reached nearly 2,800 and that infant mortality increases when the wheat supply is interrupted, but also that there may be increased obesity and diabetes due to high carbohydrate intake.  (4) Self-help provisions have been poorly monitored by USAID/E, although policy dialogue, Egyptian coordination, and the specificity of the agreements have improved since 1979.  (5) Title I, which the GOE considers critical to U.S.-Egyptian relations, has helped ensure the U.S. foreign policy objective - which has been overriding - of Egyptian stability, a key factor in the Mideast peace process.  (6) Marketing and budgetary effects have been limited. The United States should continue to encourage GOE efforts to adjust its agricultural pricing policy in order to ensure that this largest of all Title I programs fully complies with the letter and spirit of recent P.L. 480 legislation and U.S. development policy initiatives.  Included are 25 tables, 13 figures, several complementary analyses, and a 40-item bibliography (1968-82).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace|Food aid programs|Wheat|Imports|Agricultural policy|Agricultural production|Foreign policy|Food for Peace Title I","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL015.pdf","3,318 KB","000156 - USAID.

"The impact of an A.I.D. project (1970-76) to improve the availability and efficiency of rural education in Paraguay is assessed. As a result of the project, a much better educational program is available to many more students and is delivered by a system and a staff responsive to change.  Although fewer rural primary schools were built than targeted (32 of 120) due to rising costs, they have greatly improved rural students' access to formal education, afforded students more time to help with farmwork, and reduced seasonal dropout and transportation costs.  The project also revised primary and secondary school curricula, introduced a textbook production and distribution system, and shifted administrative responsibility from the Ministry of Education (MOE) to two Regional Education Centers.  These Centers, which have conveniently been located in rural areas, have provided pre-service and inservice teacher training, demonstrated use of the new curricula, helped diffuse reforms in formal education, and have become effectively decentralized units of administration. On the other hand, the reforms have been limited in both scope and implementation.  The new curricula are in use in only 10% of schools nationwide (although in all AID-built schools) and improving achievement scores and retention/promotion rates have annoyed teachers - who are very poorly paid - by imposing greater workloads at no extra pay. Unfortunately, the MOE's budget is so inadequate that even necessary instructional materials are in short supply.  This continual underbudgeting threatens to unravel the project's achievements. The project taught several lessons:  (1) Provision by local communities of land, labor, and continued maintenance excellently demonstrates the impact of local citizenry on educational reform. (2) Despite the skills provided by over 20 years of A.I.D. assistance, it was a new and committed Minister of Education who provided the political catalyst needed to make the project work. (3) Realistic and effective national budget allocations are needed to ensure sustained educational reform.  In a word, responsibility for expanding and refining the program now rests with the Government of Paraguay.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Education|Rural areas|Primary education|Secondary education|School buildings|Building construction|Curriculum design|Decentralization|Budgeting|Beneficiary interviews","Paraguay","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL017.pdf","2,449 KB","000156 - USAID.

"In Africa, government agricultural pricing policies often undermine production incentives.  So concludes this study of the forms and effects of government intervention in rural African agricultural markets. The authors first review government regulation of African export crops, including coffee, cocoa, palm oil, cotton, sugar, and bananas. Although privately produced, these crops are required by law to be sold through state-controlled marketing boards originally designed to stablilize prices for the benefit of farmers.  Instead, the boards have heavily taxed export crops in order to finance development of nonfarm sectors, obtain foreign exchange, and pay their own high operating costs.  As a result, prices received by farmers for their crops are often less than half of international prices.  Many farmers have responded by shifting to production of less heavily taxed crops, and high marketing costs imposed by the boards have played a part in dramatic declines in exports from Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana, and the Sudan.  Export crop producers are also burdened by the high level of currency overvaluation in many African countries which further undermines production by reducing the value of export earnings. In the second part of the paper, the authors show how African governments regulate domestic food prices.  Marketing bureaucracies act to lower food prices but in so doing increase marketing costs and price inefficiency and weaken production incentives. Governments also use trade policies to lower food prices by banning exports, allowing duty-free imports, and maintaining overvalued currencies.  The origins of these food pricing policies are traced to the need of governments to satisfy the demands of politically powerful urban food consumers for low-cost food. In a final section, a proposal is presented for reforming the marketing boards which would entail allowing markets to make and retain a limited amount of profits to encourage efficient operation.  The boards would be made accountable by including producers and cooperative society members on executive committees.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Economic policy|Prices|Food economics|Marketing|Exports|Agricultural production|Agricultural policy|Government policy","Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL014.pdf","1,691 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Of the more than 200 ethnic groups in Cameroon, the Bamileke appear to be the most economically successful.  Reasons for their success are analyzed in this study of traditional Bamileke culture and its adaptation to contemporary economic conditions. Unlike most other African ethnic groups, traditional Bamileke society provided avenues of upward mobility to everyone, with improvement of status through hard work and individual initiative.  Emphasis was and is on competition in work, effort, savings, and economic improvement, and on frugality rather than emulative consumption.  Individuals are expected to make their own way in the world while retaining a strong ethnic identity and contributing to the group. Traditional Bamileke institutions have been highly adaptive to modern economic functions.  The Mandjong, for example, a traditional title society, plays an important role in generating capital through a savings and loan system.  Women have always been important economic producers, and modern-day women's societies, deriving from earlier associations of the best women cultivators, strongly influence economic development and capital accumulation. The Bamileke spirit of enterprise has also been influenced by land pressures and inheritance patterns.  The high population density of the Western Province of Cameroon - the traditional Bamileke home - has led young people to push out into urban areas, where they have found economic success, albeit not without support from others in their group. Similarly, the patrilineal system of inheritance - another divergence from the African tradition - allows inheritances to be used for economic gain, rather than shared with poorer family members. The Bamileke experience demonstrates that group solidarity does not necessarily stifle individual initiative and private enterprise, but can be a positive force in economic development. While the Bamileke success has developed in a policy environment which is non-ideological and pragmatic, with little government intervention, not all ethnic groups have responded to the same stimuli.  In a plural society, ethnicity is a vital social issue and must be considered in any strategies of public or private sector development.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Economic development|Ethnic groups|Community behavior|Private enterprises","Cameroon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL016.pdf","1,449 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen agricultural planning and extension services for women in Malawi.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/79-3/83 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with project, Ministry of Agriculture, and USAID/M personnel. In spite of start-up delays due to early USAID/M lack of support, and underfunding for vehicles and support staff, the project has been so successful that with country-specific modifications, it could serve as a model for similar efforts wordwide.  It has benefited from personnel, material, and administrative support from the Government of Malawi and from close association with the Farming Systems Analysis (FSA) section (funded under project 6120202) of the MOA's Chitedze research station. The interdisciplinary, farming systems approach to data collection has been critical to project success.  Socioeconomic, agronomic, and agricultural services data have been collected in high plateau, lake shore, and mid-altitude semiarid plain ecological zones.  Although much of the data had been gathered during national surveys, the project has, for the first time, focused attention on the need to analyze smallholder problems by gender. To improve service delivery and help the MOA form a coherent policy on women, the project has gone beyond its scope of work by, e.g., helping develop curricula for training female extension workers, advising on ways to improve career opportunities for women in the Department of Agricultural Development, and evaluating extension programs vis a vis their assistance to women farmers. A series of on-farm and research station soybean trials conducted under women farmers' management have proved highly successful in focusing on women while optimizing liaison among researchers, extensionists, and beneficiaries.  The project has also developed a circular aimed at combating male extensionists' reluctance to approach female farmers and is monitoring a technique being tested in Blantyre to allow more women farmers access to credit. impacts on women is being prepared. It is recommended that a technical advisor be provided under the agricultural research and extension project planned for FY 1983 to continue activities begun under this project.  Specific suggestions for this advisor and follow-up activities are included.","Attached to PD-AAM-810","Special Evaluation","Documents","OTR-0300-C-00-2081-00","","2/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Farming systems research|Agricultural research|Farms|Agricultural surveys|Limited data plus","Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAM810B.pdf","871 KB","","","008573 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to upgrade the Government of Egypt's (GOE) tax administration and collection operations.  Special evaluation covers the period 1980-83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project, USAID/E, and U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) consultants. Progress has been achieved in four areas.  The GOE reorganized its Tax Department (TD) along functional lines, and although coordination problems remain, TD staff members, 42 of whom have received U.S. training, have adjusted rather well to their new responsibilities.  A separate Tax Training Institute (TTI) was developed to provide necessary training.  Course materials were prepared in tax collection and examination and 26 courses in tax-related skills were offered to 533 students from 8/82 on.  An ADP division was created, staffed, and equipped with 24 data entry machines; training (of 15 programmers) was initiated in 4/82 and operations in 8/82.  A system to process business tax withholding returns was developed and at the time of evaluation 528,000 returns were in various stages of processing.  Finally, a streamlined and more accurate collection system was implemented in 7/82 in the Cairo area and later extended to other areas of Egypt, reducing paper work and transcription errors and partially shifting the collection burden to the taxpayer. Long delays were experienced in most phases of the project due to overly optimistic time schedules, development of project activities before the GOE was fully prepared, and delays in placing senior TD staff and procuring a site for the TTI.  The TD's policy of examining 100% of returns was hampered by an insufficient, inadequately trained, and overworked staff (as a result, 1978 returns were still being examined in some districts in 1982) and by IRS's focus on a strict selection examination process in the face of TD resistance.  Lastly, lack of coordination between the Tax Administration Project and the Tax Modernization Project, designed to be developed in tandem, resulted in a failure to achieve optimum results from the two activities. Ten recommendations to redress the above-noted problems are set forth.","Attached to PD-AAN-302","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Taxation|Institution building|Training personnel|Computers|Tax collection|Beneficiary interviews","Egypt","","","001468 - University of Tennessee","","008539 - USAID.

"The single most important element contributing to the growth of the private sector in the Dominican Republic has been the integration, at both program and project levels, of training, technical assistance, and capital assistance.  Thus concludes this paper, one of a series of country studies examining A.I.D. assistance to the private sector. After describing historical, geographic, socioeconomic, and public policy factors relevant to private enterprise development in the Dominican Republic, the authors outline the Dominican institutional framework for promoting private sector growth, showing how lenders, training and technical assistance institutions (and organizations that support both credit and training institutions) help to bring about private sector growth as much as do external donors like A.I.D.  Case studies of ten lending institutions (four financieras, two commercial banks, and four public sector banks) and of fourteen institutions that serve lenders by providing educational, training, and advisory services to credit recipients are then presented. The authors find that public policy in the Dominican Republic - which has long encouraged the private sector to seek its own solutions - resulted in the private sector's discovery of the central role of training in the capital lending process.  Since 1962, the entire private sector effort has been based on the principle that a financial institution must train before lending and an enterprise must be trained before borrowing.  Other factors that have abetted private sector growth in the Dominican Republic include:  a pervasive spirit of cooperation within the private sector; a high literacy rate and abiding belief in the value of education; and a positive attitude towards foreign assistance.  Although the Dominicans have structured and carried out their own private enterprise development program, A.I.D., by being sensitive and responsive to their needs, has made several crucial contributions.  Future development of this sector, as programs move to encourage entrepreneurship among lower-income strata, must, however, proceed cautiously, with consideration given to public subsidy of costly lending services.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Private enterprises|Government policy|Development strategies|Financial institutions|Credit|Economic development|Management training","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL018.pdf","4,625 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Lack of good management is the principal reason that most irrigation projects have failed to reach their potential.  Thus concludes this review of A.I.D. irrigation projects, based on impact evaluations, other studies, and a 5/83 AID-sponsored conference on irrigation management. Included are discussions of types of irrigation systems; social and economic impacts; policies and investment strategies; management; maintenance and rehabilitation; and project planning, monitoring, and sustainability. Although irrigation normally improves yields, it is not a simple solution to food deficits.  Socioeconomic impacts (on, e.g., civic participation, women, the environment) are difficult to assess. Irrigation systems range along a continuum from local management to external control.  The former is most effective, yet traditional community-based systems are often ignored in policy considerations. Problems of water management, either by water user associations or implementing agency, are exacerbated by donors' bureaucratic priorities; involving farmers in planning undoubtedly leads to improved management. System maintenance is also best done at the local level.  Existing water user associations should be encouraged and equitable cost recovery from users fostered. Irrigation project planning is subject to a series of pressures prompting hurried approval.  Design problems include poor donor coordination and failure to adequately consider such factors as farmer needs, host country commitment, agronomic realities, and social context. Planning should be done within the context of natural resource strategy, and relationships between irrigated and nonirrigated areas understood.  Issues such as system size, public vs. private, or rehabilitation vs. new construction are closely interrelated. Technology choice should allow maximum flexibilty in design, installation, and operation. Agricultural triage (choosing between competing needs and goals) is usually dictated by fiscal constraints, but may reinforce income and social differences; a donor influencing policy should realize the implications thereof. Appended are a 9-page bibliography (1950-83), a list of A.I.D. irrigation studies, summaries and a discussion of the impact evaluations, and the conference proceedings.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigation|Water management|Development project planning|Agricultural development|Development project design","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL019.pdf","4,272 KB","000153 - USAID.

"Evaluates Contract Research Program (CRP) managed by the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council (BARC).  Special evaluation covers the period l980-4/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with researchers. CRP has funded 62 projects, on soils (8), irrigation and water management (15), economics and social science (10), crops and forestry (14), agricultural engineering (10), and animals (5). Several of these are interinstitutional efforts.  CRP has helped to stimulate and encourage research, provided valuable experience in research planning and management, and led to recognition of BARC as a leading national agency for agricultural research. Although CRP has increased interinstitutional linkages, much more can be done in this regard.  Funds for 4 of the engineering projects have not been utilized due to lack of cooperative planning.  The irrigation and water management projects lack common objectives, and a project on pulses, while it has collected valuable germplasm and identified some promising inoculants, has evinced little institutional cooperation. Cropping systems projects, on the other hand, have been a good example of cooperative research planning and management.  BARC should increase field trial collaboration in all its projects. In other areas, it appears the soils projects will yield valuable information about fertilizer needs in Bangladesh, but more attention is needed to setting long-term research goals and a single soil testing/leaf analysis laboratory should be developed. Projects investigating dry-season use of rainfall, soil moisture, and the high water table show great promise and economic potential, while evapo-transpiration projects show little. Procedures for selecting and monitoring CRP projects are generally good, but the selection process should be modified to better identify research having major potential economic impact. Also, an inventory of Bangladesh's total agricultural research program, by institution, should be available when project selections are made and BARC should: institute a system for periodic peer review of the total CRP; establish an Agricultural Research Information Center; strengthen its agricultural engineering staff; and initiate an annual research conference.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Research organizations|Research management|Research collaboration","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAN609.pdf","1,016 KB","000655 - International Agricultural Development Service|001067 - Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council (BARC)","","008511 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish a regional outreach program at the Nutrition Institute for Central America and Panama (INCAP). Special evaluation covers the period 9/81-9/82 and is based on document review, interviews with project personnel and counterparts, and site visits. The project is on target.  Of 148.7 person-months of TA delivered to countries in the region, 39.2% was in nutrition and public health, 18.9% in food and nutrition planning, and 9.1% in food technology, with the greatest amount (36.6%) being delivered in Guatemala.  TA was improved through conceptual and methodological developments, including the fielding of new, young professionals. The crucially important system of international technical cooperation was improved through the contracting of food and nutrition planners.  The majority of national-level training (42.3%) was given in El Salvador; for detailed training outputs, see the abstract of PD-AAN-321.  The 2nd International Conference on Food and Nutrition Planning was attended in Panama by 109 participants from the region; another conference was held in Guatemala. Information dissemination has progressed well, although at high cost. A list of 800 clients was compiled, a document classification system developed, and a system for information dissemination created through the technical trimestral bulletin INCAP INFORMA and other bulletins of bibliographies and abstracts. Implementation problems stemmed from:  (1) lack of national priorities coupled with political instability, resulting in failure of governments to supply dependable counterparts; (2) unclear INCAP TA goals and strategies rendering difficult the determination of country TA needs and of INCAP resources; and (3) poor coordination among INCAP, Missions, and other agencies, especially Ministries of Agriculture, resulting in underutilization of resources for applied health and agriculture programs. While efforts to resolve the above problems have been somewhat effective, recommendations are made aimed at their further resolution.","Attached to PD-AAN-321","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Management training|Nutrition improvement|Nutrition education|Institution building|Indigenous education|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data plus","Central America|Panama","","","002290 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Lesotho Opportunities Industrialization Center's (LOIC's) entrepreneurship training (ET) program.  Special evaluation covers the period 1980-7/82 and is based on document review and interviews with trainees, other business persons, Government of Lesotho (GOL) officials, and contractor staff. LOIC has done an excellent job.  Short (6-week) tuition-free courses covering marketing, financial management, inventory control, labor relations, and planning have been provided to 111 traders and small manufacturers (more than half women).  The large majority of trainees found the courses to be stimulating and well presented, the faculty competent, and the material directly applicable to their business operations. Institution building is also progressing well.  Although LOIC has not yet been able to establish its planned Industrial Advisory Board, it has established a Board of Directors and a Technical Advisory Committee. The creation of these bodies - composed of GOL officials and private sector professionals - has put LOIC in good favor with the GOL.  While LOIC has received considerable policy direction from the GOL, this has not threatened its autonomy. Despite this record of success, questions can be raised about the developmental significance of the ET program.  Specific shortcomings include a lack of follow-up assistance to trainees and selection of trainees on the basis of personal success, rather than potential, leaving a broad talent pool untapped. Also, most trainees have been merchants or restaurateurs; the manufacturing sector has been comparatively neglected. It is recommended therefore that LOIC sustain and nurture its training operations, but attempt to link them more closely with Lesotho's larger social and economic needs.  In this regard, LOIC should seek out ET technologies and technical assistance packages which are available from A.I.D. and other development organizations.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Entrepreneurs|Management training|Small scale enterprises|Entrepreneurship|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Lesotho","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN352.pdf","1,672 KB","","","000088 - USAID.

"Evaluates project implemented by Columbia University's Center for Population and Family Health (CPFH) to provide assistance to LDC's in family planning and health care and in operations research (OR). Special evaluation covers the period 1979-5/83, and is based on document review, interviews with A.I.D. and CPFH staff, and visits to subprojects in Sudan, Brazil, and Haiti. The Center has achieved, and in many cases surpassed, project tasks and expectations.  It has initiated and secured A.I.D. approval for 11 (vs. 5 targeted) new subprojects (SP's); 9 of the SP's have focused on community- or household-based distribution of contraceptives.  Resident advisors have been placed in 6 countries, and an additional 3 will be placed in Togo and Burundi.  Both U.S. and in-country CPFH staff have provided a great deal of valuable TA in operational problems in family planning and health delivery and in the development of indigenous OR programs.  In SP's that are completed or nealy completed, emphasis has been put on documentation of results for future application within the particular country involved.  Already, in six countries, results have been replicated in larger scale projects or the SP approach has been incorporated into the expansion of an existing delivery system.  During the past few years, SP activities have, for the most part, shifted from Latin America and Asia to Africa. A well-run library and information clearinghouse has been established within the Center and is providing technical literature and information retrieval on primary health care and family planning to an extensive audience.  The Center also conducts an annual month-long OR training program which has promoted contact between CPFH staff and LDC (mainly African) leaders and researchers.  Short-term OR training has also been provided in Sudan. Continued support of the CPFH is recommended, with greater emphasis on documenting and disseminating the project's overall experience to date and on defining and standardizing the Center's operating processes. Specific recommendations address:  SP selection, development, operation, and evaluation; TA; information services; and CPFH organization, operations, and management. Summary reports on the site visits to Sudan, Brazil, and Haiti are appended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","5/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Operations research|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN349.pdf","4,100 KB","001318 - American Public Health Association.

"The impact of A.I.D. assistance to the Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ) during the early 1980's is examined in this report, focusing on a $20 million reconstruction program grant and a $2 million project grant for rebuilding rural health clinics. Major topics include the aid's political impact, macroeconomic rationale, relief and reconstruction activities, and conclusions and lessons learned. For the most part, A.I.D. assistance was successful.  The GOZ administered the programs efficiently and equitably.  Roads, schools, cattle dips, government housing, and clinics were rebuilt during difficult circumstances, and seed and food relief were distributed. Additionally, through the reconstruction activities, the GOZ was able to reestablish administrative structures in rural areas from which it had been excluded by the civil war. Unfortunately, recognition that A.I.D. had contributed to the reconstruction effort was practically nonexistent in rural areas and uncertain in political circles.  There was little evidence of A.I.D. oversight of the reconstruction and relief activities, because of the assumption that the cash grant mode of assistance did not require it and a lack of resident Mission staff. Moreover, some of the programs were limited in their achievements (e.g., the winter vegetable seed packet, which was too complicated and funded too late to be of much help to the farmers who received it, and the rural health clinics, which, though rapidly reconstructed, suffered from a lack of drugs, equipment, and adequate inspection by the Ministry of Health). The bureaucracy which effectively implemented the programs watched its future competence put into question by reorganization, changing personnel policies, and the uncertain tenure of white administrators with their often dated attitudes toward rural Africans. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) A.I.D. has a range of foreign assistance tools available, such as policy analysis and technical expertise.  The success of the Zimbabwe program should not delude the Agency into thinking that money is all it has to offer.  (2) A.I.D. can respond flexibly and quickly when political priorities are clear and sufficiently important.  (3) If a high priority is given to foreign assistance as a symbol of U.S. commitment, it needs to be thought through as carefully as the development objectives.  The country team should ensure that a strategy for achieving political benefits from the aid is established and its progress regularly assessed.  (4) The Zimbabwe experience suggests the need for more flexible forms of assistance.  Appropriate changes should be made to simplify A.I.D. procedures.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Disaster reconstruction|War relief|Economic infrastructure|Political objectives","Zimbabwe","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ605.pdf","1,693 KB","000156 - USAID.

"The real question, when evaluating an agricultural research project, is whether or not an institutional capability to carry on sustained research and extension has been developed.  By this criterion, Project Wheat, implemented in Tunisia during the period 1965-77, was a success. The project was designed to introduce and adapt to Tunisian conditions semi-dwarf high-yield wheat varieties developed by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) in Mexico, and to train Tunisians in agricultural research and extension. Many project impacts are only now being realized.  Tunisian research capabilities - developed through M.S. and especially Ph.D training of 19 agricultural resarchers (13 are still involved in cereals programs in Tunisia) as well as practical training for 55 others - are now being demonstrated in improved research, extension, and educational programs, conducted without external assistance; and in increased farmer acceptance of new varieties and technologies. During the project, five bread wheat and five durum wheat varieties were developed; Tunisian researchers have since developed two improved varieties of each type.  An extension and farm demonstration program begun during the project is now staffed with trained Tunisians and still successful.  During 1971-81, Tunisian cereal (wheat and barley) production increased by 5,302,000 MT over the previous 11 years (saving nearly $126 million in foreign exchange costs), and annual per capita production increased from 104 kg in 1970 to 160 kg in 1980.  In addition, both per capita cereal consumption and farmer incomes have increased and subsistence farmers are now better integrated into the economy.  Crop increases have been used for export and for tourist hotel supply, improving Tunisia's trade balance. On the other hand, increased employment of women in farming and rural industry (due to the migration of men), has had one negative result: greater use of prepared food and consequently a poorer farm diet. Further, not all institutional goals (e.g., integration of research and extension) were achieved, nor was the perhaps illusory goal of food production self-sufficiency.  A 99-item bibliography (1960-82) is appended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Wheat|Agricultural production|Participants|Agricultural research|Agricultural education|Institution building","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL022.pdf","8,639 KB","000051 - Board for International Food and Agricultural Development (BIFAD)","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Ex post evaluation|Impact evaluation|Evaluation team","","Johnson, William Frederick|Ferguson, Carl E.|Fikry, Mona","Agricultural development","Oct 1983","","","AID project impact evaluation report, no. 48","Tunisia : the wheat development program","","PN-AAL-022","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTgwMzc0","Tunisia",""
"Evaluates project to develop Morocco's Hassan II Agronomic and Veterinary Institute (IAV) as a modern agricultural college. Mid-term special evaluation covers the period 4/80-6/83 and is based on document review, interviews with project and related personnel, and site visits. Implementation is on or ahead of schedule, justifying a proposed 5-year extension.  U.S. training of IAV third cycle (Master's) students, most of them destined to become IAV faculty members, has generally proceeded smoothly.  To date, 131 individuals (vs. a target of 70) have been sent for training and 16 have already received their degrees.  The number of IAV faculty participants has totaled 70 (vs. 65 targeted), 54 at the Ph.D., 16 at the Master's level; they are returning at the expected rate. One faculty member was trained to direct the National Agricultural Library (formerly, the Documentation Center). A key IAV priority is to establish direct linkages between its new departments and equivalents at many U.S. centers, not just at the University of Minnesota (UOM), the contractor.  In pursuit of this end, IAV wishes to offer future faculty trainees a 3-year training package in preparation for reception of the doctorate from IAV.  Trainees would follow individual programs developed with counterpart U.S. departments, not the usual U.S. Ph.D. programs.  Although this approach might jeopardize both the willingness of U.S. schools to send advisors to supervise dissertation research at IAV and the credibility of the IAV doctorate, it is more in conformity than the present system with A.I.D. policy and worth pursuing.  The evaluation team also agreed with IAV that postdoctoral visits to the United States should be limited to 6-8 weeks to avoid prolonged absences from IAV. In other areas, IAV's institutional development could be furthered by even greater stress on IAV outreach, and generally good project management could be strengthened by improved communications among IAV, UOM, and A.I.D., with IAV adopting a more active managerial role. The project, with modifications encompassed in 60 recommendations, could serve as a model for similar training/institution building projects.","Companion project evaluation summary: PD-AAP-122","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-19-1138-00","","9/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Agricultural colleges|Teacher education|Participants|Faculty|Graduate education|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN481.pdf","2,343 KB","008579 - USAID.

"Evaluates personnel management component of an integrated rural health and population project in India.  Special evaluation covers a period of over 2 years ending 7/83 and is based on interviews with project staff and beneficiaries conducted during visits to the five project States. Complexity and unclear procedures for creating and filling posts, coupled with little communication between the few trained management personnel, have delayed the creation of new posts for field staff. Training and assignment difficulties, especially poorly structured recruitment programs, inflexible candidate requirements, incomplete training facilities, and inadequate physical, social, professional, and security support have caused high turnovers in female workers stationed in isolated rural posts and in medical officers; the latter have also suffered from a lack of pre- and in-service training in public health planning and administration and of authority commensurate with their responsibilities.  Further, lack of effective incentive and career promotion systems has resulted in lackluster on-the-job performance. Attempts to solve the above problems during implementation have been sufficient, however, to allow recruitment and training of medical and paramedical staff in the project areas to progress at a rate that will allow most posts to be filled by the project's end.  However, greater efforts in retaining field staff in isolated areas and in encouraging high motivation are needed. Staffing of project management (PM) posts has varied among the States.  Unclear definition of current and post-project planning, implementation, and evaluation management roles and unclear structures and procedures of the steering committees and governing bodies for staffing of positions have resulted in delayed recruitment to PM posts. Coordination between government, health institution, USAID/I and PM staff has been weak.  Rate ceilings for PM budgets have resulted in cross-State disparity in the quantity and quality of posts created and financially supported.  Priority needs are to clarify PM staff roles and create and fill effective PM posts.","Evaluation period: 1 Jun-31 Jul 1983","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","9/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Health care|Personnel management|Paramedical education|Women|Paramedicals|Medical education|Health professional education|Health care administration|Management training|Clinics|Beneficiary interviews","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN486.pdf","1,968 KB","001318 - American Public Health Association.

"Evaluates project to reduce the incidence of immunizable diseases among children aged 0-5 in Mauritania.  Final evaluation covers the period 7/81-7/83 and is based on document review, interviews with health workers and beneficiaries, an indepth survey of the Gorgol Region, and visits to other regions. The goal of immunization by 1985 of 80% of children aged 0-5 years against tuberculosis, diphtheria, whooping cough, poliomyelitis, tetanus, and measles was revised in late 1982 to a more realistic 80% of infants 0-11 months and 60% of all children aged 0-5 years, and the project was extended to 8/31/83. In the Gorgol Region not all children vaccinated had vaccination cards.  The percentage of complete vaccinations is 13% if only children with cards are counted, and 20% if those with acceptable histories are also included.  In other regions, major problems facing EPI mobile teams were:  inadequate per diems and gasoline supplies; problems in maintaining the cold chain under difficult field conditions; and incomplete staffing.  Maternal/child health (MCH) centers providing immunizations had similar problems, notably, inadequate stocks of vaccine and equipment, inadequately trained personnel and insufficient numbers thereof, poor recordkeeping, and failure to provide health education.  Some centers lack cold chain equipment and rely on mobile teams to deliver vaccines.  Both teams and centers had acceptable emergency plans in case of cold chain breakdown.  The dedication and quality of regional EPI personnel were impressive. At the central level, staff are seriously overburdened, resulting in a dearth of program planning and supervision.  The Government of Mauritania (GOM) is committed to integrating EPI with other primary health care services, but EPI-MCH coordination remains vague and lack of formally defined lines of responsibility impedes backstopping of EPI activities.  Central-level vaccine management also has various shortcomings, e.g., in cold chain and inventory maintenance.  The GOM still relies on external donors to fund all immunization activities. Progress in implementing the recommendations of the 1981 evaluation has been disappointing, but some improvement has been seen.  A series of new recommendations are made.","Attached to PD-AAN-495|Evaluation period: Jul 1981-Jul 1983","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Immunizations|Maternal child health care|Health care administration|Mobile health services|Health care planning|Health policy|Beneficiary interviews","Mauritania","","","","","008576 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to provide low-cost core housing units in Kenya's secondary cities.  Special evaluation covers the period 10/81-7/83 and is based on visits to seven subprojects. The project, the first of its kind to be implemented in Kenya outside of Nairobi, although not without its shortcomings, has significantly assisted the Government of Kenya to shift toward low-income housing.  A total of 1,001 units were built in 11 cities (vs. 1,400 in 12 cities originally targeted).  Although site layouts were poorly designed by the National Housing Corporation (NHC) and local councils, the level of services and construction appear to be quite high in comparison with similar projects in other countries.  At the sites visited, 45% of units have already been expanded by owners.  The units are desirable to higher-income families, and many owners are profiting by subletting their units without council approval, which is prohibited.  Local councils have made no attempts to reduce the incidence of subletting; only three councils have imposed the planned 10% subletting levy. Implementation delays - subprojects were completed 2-55 months late - resulted from problems with site selection and acquisition, inefficient contractors, difficult soil conditions, and inaccurate surveying, as well as from a lack of coordination between NHC and local councils.  The Meru subproject, last to be occupied, has not yet been completed or turned over to the Town Council.  Its streets and drains are in need of repair, erosion problems remain, and two units have yet to be built. Maintenance of streets, drainage, public space, and sewerage by local councils has been largely inadequate, due to a lack of funds.  In addition, beneficiaries in every subproject have fallen into large payment arrears, mainly because local councils have not made serious efforts to collect monthly payments.  While several local councils sent repossession notices to those in serious arrears, none took follow-up action.  Community development activities, e.g., educating owners on unit maintenance, have also been lacking. Several recommendations address project design and implementation problems.","Attached to PD-AAN-504","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Housing investment guaranty|Low cost housing|Urban areas","Kenya","","","000968 - Planning and Development Collaborative International, Inc.

"Evaluates OPG to Catholic Relief Services (CRS) to develop a private dispensary-based system of rural health education in North Cameroon. Final evaluation, conducted by a CRS-hired consultant, covers the period 6/75-12/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project and related host country personnel. Due to the lack of qualified candidates (and the remoteness of the project area), the training of dispensary personnel, a major project focus, was substantially short of target despite a 2-year project extension.  Training was provided to only 3 of 12 nurses (with one more in training) and to 3 of 40 auxiliary nurses.  No training was given to dispensary aids, health educators, or nurse/health education methodologists, although 29 miscroscopists were trained (versus a target of 8) so that each dispensary would have at least 2 technicians. Further, only 45 of 960 targeted extensionists were trained, and these are paid itinerary agents (IA's) of the dispensaries, and not volunteers, as planned. Nevertheless, the IA's have enabled the dispensaries to extend outreach services to neighboring villages via maternal/child care centers and village pharmacies, leading to notable benefits in child health and nutrition (although future evaluations should validate the village health status data reported in early IA surveys).  Because the development of self-sufficient village health committees, intended as the structural basis of village activities, has taken longer than expected, village leaders have been trained to manage individual health areas. Decentralization of project management left each of the 14 dispensaries on its own, linked solely by visits from the woman missionary who has trained both the nurses and the IA's by herself. More recently, however, with activities expanding and the end of A.I.D. financing at hand, the staff of the various dispensaries have begun to work together toward the future. The key obstacles to indigenization of the dispensaries are the lack of workers qualified to become nurses and the dispensaries' financial constraints; a replacement for the overworked missionary, for example, would command a substantially higher salary. Greater host government support seems needed.","Attached to PD-AAN-506","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Health education|Dispensaries|Private sector|Health professional education|Paramedical education|Health outreach services|Rural areas|Villages","Cameroon","","","008524 - USAID.

"Lessons learned from A.I.D.'s efforts to strengthen developing country agricultural research capacities are assessed.  The assessment is based on the findings of impact evaluations of AID-funded research projects in Kenya, Central America, Korea, Guatemala, Nepal, Thailand, Tunisia, and West Africa; a review of other project evaluations; and a 6/82 AID-hosted international conference (proceedings appended).  Key findings and recommendations for future A.I.D. efforts fall into four categories. First, a genuine, long-term commitment to agricultural research by the host government determines research sustainability and indirectly the use of research findings.  Such support will be more likely if there is continuous dialogue among politicians, administrators, and researchers, and if the government receives a clear demonstration of the potential benefits of the research and agrees with the research institution on the latter's mandate and authority. Second, since host government policies and infrastructure partially determine farmer adoption of new technologies and the availabiliy of needed support services, research programs should be selected within a broad rural development policy and planning framework.  Also, technological changes can sharpen inequity among rural households if technology adoption depends upon a resource distributed unequally. Third, research programs can only help increase food production if their designers are aware of existing farming systems and local agro-ecological and economic conditions and the resources available to farmers.  This will demand linkages among researchers, extensionists, farmers, concerned government entities, and agricultural training institutions. Fourth, the sustainability of research demands efforts to retain skilled personnel.  To this end, A.I.D. training should complement technical assistance and be adapted to a country's real needs and capabilities, and returning trainees should be given adequate incentives.  National research institutions should maintain an active network of information exchange with other national and international institutions. Most of the above issues, it is concluded, share a common solution - coordination and information flow among all concerned.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Development project planning|Technology transfer|Small farms|Farmers|Cooperation","Kenya|Central America|Korea R|Guatemala|Nepal|Thailand|Tunisia|West Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL020.pdf","7,293 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the Government of the Philippines (GOP) conduct an integrated health, nutrition, and population program in the Bicol River Basin region of Southern Luzon.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/79-12/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel and beneficiaries. Performance has been mixed.  Despite a need to strengthen certain areas (especially community organization, communications skills, and communicable disease control), the targeted 400 Barangay Health Aides (BHA's) have been well trained and supervised, performed adequately, and received good support from all levels of local government and from the communities they serve.  On the debit side, the project has failed to determine whether it intends BHA's to provide health services or merely health education, and local government officials will have difficulty meeting the need - caused by a 1/83 unilateral decision by the GOP's Project Management Office (PMO) - to pay half the BHA's stipends.  The PMO has also failed to staff the project adequately; in fact, since all of its key members are regular Ministry of Health employees, it is questionable whether the PMO exists in more than name. The lack of PMO personnel, along with the slow release of funds by the GOP's Office of Budget Management, has caused the environmental sanitation infrastructure component to fall seriously behind schedule. Only 10,200 household toilets (vs. a targeted 32,000) have been installed, only 6 (of 400 targeted) community water facilities have been constructed, and none of the 400 targeted school toilets have been built.  Planning to chlorinate water and to upgrade household water facilities is yet to begin. Also, the PMO has been supplying materials for barangay water systems on a grant basis rather than under the lending arrangement stipulated by the loan agreement.  Mainly as a result of delays with this component, only 17% of A.I.D. funds have been disbursed with the project almost two-thirds complete. A 1-year extension will probably be necessary.  Finally, there is little evidence that other line agencies are participating in this ""integrated"" project. Numerous recommendations are included.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated health care|Community health workers|Sanitation|Bicol River|Beneficiary interviews","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN514.pdf","4,317 KB","008592 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Project Development Assistance Program (PDAP) to promote development in the Eastern Caribbean Islands and Belize. Special evaluation covers the period 9/81-8/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project, host government, and private sector personnel. The program, a well-adapted approach to the special needs of the Islands and Belize, has been modified during execution to focus on private, rather than public, sector investment, a transition necessitating some important changes.  PDAP's strengths are an experienced industrial promotion specialist as consultant, capable field representatives, and effective linkages with Island USAID's and other donor and investment promotion organizations (principally the Caribbean Development Bank).  PDAP has helped promote 13 new enterprises, which are providing 226 jobs, with employment for 2000 expected eventually. It has also financed 10 technical studies and conducted 14 marketing studies of acceptable professional quality but addressing industries dependent on local capital and know-how, rather than the employment-intensive industries supported by foreign investments that are needed. The program has a number of weaknesses.  Its goals are not sufficiently ambitious; the target of 3,000 industrial jobs should be nearer 30,000.  The nonavailability of industrial buildings for potential investors is a major bottleneck; the program does not transfer investment know-how to host countries; and the reporting system is not adequately geared to the new private sector focus.  Most importantly, the search for potential investors, centered in the Coopers and Lybrand (C&L) Washington office, involves a staff inexperienced in industrial promotion, a program too small and passive to be effective (given the new targets), overconcentration on secondary markets at the expense of prime U.S. market promotion, a poor location away from the business mainstream of New York, and a standard approach to promotion (repeating diffuse general publicity rather than concentrating on a few promising pre-selected target firms). A budget shortfall is threatening, and the revised budget proposed by C&L is inadequate.  Recommendations address all these issues, and advise continuation of PDAP for an additional 3 years.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","538-0042-C-00-30039","","9/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Employment|Investment promotion|Private sector|Investment|Industrial development|Beneficiary count","Belize|Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN527.pdf","578 KB","001757 - USAID.

"Peru's experience with P.L. 480 Title I food aid provides some important lessons, especially regarding USAID/P's success in integrating Title I into overall A.I.D. assistance.  The Title I program's in-country context, key elements, and impacts in Peru, 1978-83, are herein reviewed. While it is difficult to isolate Title I impacts on agricultural production or nutritional status, several results of long-term importance can be noted.  USAID/P's use of Title I-generated local currency to provide counterpart funding has kept USAID/P development projects fully funded in times of economic crisis, allowed the Mission to respond quickly to new initiatives and special projects, leveraged additional Government of Peru (GOP) resources into successful projects launched with the help of Title I resources, and, perhaps most importantly, significantly increased funding for PVO Food for Work projects.  Its inclusion as part of the U.S.-GOP project level dialogue indicates Title I's integration into the total USAID/P program. On the other hand, the year-to-year uncertainty of Title I resources makes programming hazardous, sometimes forcing projects to be terminated or reduced, even, as in the case of reforestation, to the jeopardy of previous gains.  Further, USAID/P development objectives seem to carry no weight in AID/W program decisions.  The program's instability is further increased by the sometimes conflicting aims pursued by the many agencies defining yearly programs and by U.S. and GOP staff and institutional changes.  It is noted that the actions of special interests (such as the U.S. rice lobby in 1982), when not coordinated through Embassy channels, can jeopardize U.S. foreign policy interests. A pilot 3-4 year Title I program is recommended in order to eliminate program uncertainties and allow USAID/P to exert greater policy leverage, e.g., in reforming agricultural credit policies, and to allow the programming of local currencies to be integrated with the Peruvian budget cycle rather than the Title I cycle. Appendices include, inter alia, overviews of Peru's economic situation since 1968, of P.L. 480 programs, and of the uses of local currency 1955-65 and 1979-82, and a 67-item bibliography (1961-82).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Food aid programs|Development strategies|Food for Peace|Food for Peace Title I|Food for Work|Local currency","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL021.pdf","4,448 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish a Basic Health Services (SBS) program in the Dominican Republic.  Special evaluation covers the period 1975-83 and is based on document review, interviews with USAID/DR and SBS and other host country personnel, and site visits. With backing and financial support from the Department of Public Health and Social Assistance (SESPAS), into which SBS was ultimately incorporated, SBS has formed an impressive infrastructure.  As of 4/83, 5,197 health promotors (HP's) are at work in rural health clinics and visit 60-300 homes each.  Their 529 supervisors are elected by 264 local health committees comprised of 1,867 members; 2,017 other committees with 10,095 members function in areas lacking health clinics.  There are also 31 area and 7 regional supervisors.  Rural coverage is estimated at over 2 million; the urban program has been discontinued due to a high HP attrition rate and an apparent duplication of services. Actual SBS performance, however, has been minimal; HP accomplishments have been mostly in immunization and vaccination, along with some efforts in family planning.  Data from the sample areas of Azua and Mao are not wholly reliable due to a poor or nonexistent recordkeeping system but indicate some reductions in mortality rate among infants and children aged 1-4. Contraceptive use increased between 1977 and 1980, but now seems to be declining, apparently for reasons unrelated to family planning. In the area of preventive care, contrary to project expectations, HP's have conducted no education programs in nutrition, transmissible diseases, or water and sanitation, although they have occasionally monitored child growth.  HP's and their supervisors lack training and incentives.  Only a 3-week initial training (attended by 30-40% of HP's) and a 3-4 day nutrition seminar were offered for HP's; monthly meetings are not used for continuing education.  HP supervisors received a 6-8 week initial course of little benefit.  Materials and drugs other than contraceptives and vaccines are only sporadically supplied, transportation is poor, and salaries are insignificant. Based on the above shortcomings, recommendations are made to consolidate, expand, and improve SBS.","Loan nos. 517-U-028, 517-U-030","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Rural areas|Health care|Paramedical education|Change agents|Preventive medicine|Immunizations|Medical education|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN546.pdf","703 KB","000750 - Management Sciences for Health (MSH)","","008537 - USAID.

"Evaluates entomological aspects of a malaria control project in Pakistan.  Special evaluation, part two of an external evaluation begun in 5/83, covers the period 5/82-9/83 and is based on site visits and interviews with project personnel. Although (according to doubtfully reliable statistics) 96% of the target number of houses were sprayed in 1983, the spraying was only 30-35% efficient.  Operations were generally not guided by entomological data and safety measures were notably neglected. In almost all cases observed, insecticide was prepared near water pumps, occasionally being rinsed into the pump area, and except in Gujranwala record numbers of spraying personnel showed signs of cholinesterase poisoning.  Further, houses were seldom fully sprayed, sprayers were often faulty, personnel were issued only one instead of two uniforms, eating utensils were sometimes not removed prior to spraying, and in about half the cases dried insecticide was washed away by the inhabitants. The chief causes of this poor performance were inadequate supervision of spraying personnel, resistance by the population to house spraying, and a shortage of spare parts, particularly nozzle tips. Although the project's extensive entomological data still largely need to be organized and interpreted, studies show that the two major vectors - An. culicifacies and An. stephensi - are highly resistant to both DDT and dieldrin and have recently shown signs of resistance to organophosphates. Recommendations are to:  restrict spraying to active malaria foci and to epidemiologically important structures so as to reduce the amount of insecticide used and retard the development of vector resistance; encourage more systematic surveillance of such resistance; make insecticide procurement for 1985 contingent on an indepth evaluation of 1984 spraying via surprise field visits; use malathion as the insecticide of choice until entomological data indicate a need to change; encourage the long-term use of organophosphates; upgrade insecticide handling practices and safety precautions; initiate research on non-insecticidal control methods; and require urban areas to demonstrate not an 0.5/1,000 malaria incidence but only a functional surveillance system before providing them with equipment and supplies.","Pt. 1: See PD-AAM-933|Evaluation period: 12-30 Sep 1983","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Public health care|Malaria|Disease prevention and control|Pesticide spraying|Entomology|Public safety|Supervision|Insecticides","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN561.pdf","1,377 KB","008588 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to provide financing to small- and medium-sized agribusinesses in Central America.  Special evaluation covers the period 1981-10/83 and is based on document review, a site visit, and interviews with concerned officials and project subborrowers. Reasonably good progress has been made, given the poor business environment in Central America.  Some 60% of loan funds have been committed by the Latin American Agribusiness Development Corporation of Central America (LAAD-CA), the implementing agency; four subloans have been disbursed, with four others scheduled for disbursement by 12/83. The average loan size is $462,500.  LAAD-CA's ability to make new subloans has been affected by its need to devote staff time to a variety of external problems - lack of foreign exchange, a sharp reduction in foreign and local investment in the region, and Nicaragua's nationalization of subborrowers' assets. LAAD-CA has managed to keep its staffing small while maintaining the high quality of its operation.  Its procedures for evaluating potential subborrowers, which promote repayment by forging a direct personal link between lender and borrower, continue to be one of LAAD-CA's strong points.  In addition to its careful assessment, LAAD-CA has loaned only to those capable of providing strong collateral or guarantees, usually 150% of the loan's value.  Subborrowers' management capabilities, marketing skills, and technology are generally good and none of the subloans are in default, although one may have to rescheduled. Subborrowers have been well satisified with their relationship to LAAD-CA and with the speed with which it processes and disburses loans. Interest rates on the subloans (12-13.5%) are very attractive in most countries. Although it is impossible to predict subloan effects with precision, it appears that the impacts on foreign exchange earnings and gross domestic products will be greatest, impacts on farmer income good, and impacts on in-plant employment and income least. Key recommendations are that LAAD-CA should, without compromising its present standards of safety, identify new borrowers; and that subborrowers should examine the feasbility of providing TA to their suppliers (small farmers and fishermen).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","596-0000-C-00-3100-00","","11/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Agribusiness|Financial institutions|Commercial credit|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN590.pdf","1,545 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"Evaluates project to provide vocational training in the building trades to students in Lebanon.  Evaluation covers the period 8/82-5/83 (but includes a 7/83 addendum) and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with trainees, graduates, supervisors, and influential community members. The project has been of significant value in providing training in various areas of construction.  Among influential community members there is a strong feeling of appreciation and support for the program, although because of the political and economic situation, their financial support is doubtful at present.  The employers interviewed said that new graduates have a good level of conceptual understanding and basic performance skills, needing only a few months of supervised work to become fully proficient. Trainees themselves had strong praise for the program. Of 752 enrollees, 610 have successfully completed training; 63% of those interviewed were employed in their specific field of training and earning good wages; another 8% were employed in the construction trade, but in areas other than their specialized training; and 9% were employed in other trades.  Only 103 trainees, however, have been women (the target for next year is 300); of the 103, 53 were in drafting, 40 in interior decoration, and 10 in electricity.  (The 7/83 addendum provides information on the status of women graduates, indicating that those in drafting are mainly employed, but those in interior decorating having difficulty.) An informal placement service to encourage the hiring of female graduates is suggested.  Other recommendations are to consider training in other skill areas, particularly for women (e.g., office skills, bookkeeping), and, for purposes of evaluation, to: maintain closer communication with the graduates, keeping records on their activities; schedule the entrepreneurial seminars (two were conducted during the evaluation period) early in the fiscal year; and allow sufficient time for the evaluation process. To start and sustain reconstruction, the building industries will need a large labor force; the only prerequisite is the establishment of peace in Lebanon.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Technical training|Industrial occupations|Construction techniques|Vocational training|Education|Women|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data plus","Lebanon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN625.pdf","482 KB","","","008568 - USAID.

"Evaluates Resource Conservation and Utilization Project (RCUP) to combat environmental deterioration in two watersheds in Nepal. Special evaluation covers the period 7/80-4/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with persons associated with the project. It is too early to judge whether RCUP has potential for arresting and reversing the decline in Nepal's environment, although it should be noted that District Chairmen in Myadgi and Ghorka believe that the project will be able to stabilize watershed conditions if continued over a 10-year period.  While good progress has been made toward targeted outputs, these targets are not adequately linked to the scale of actual environmental problems. RCUP's integrated, multisectoral approach to soil and water conservation and increased agricultural production is suitable and probably essential.  While this approach does present management problems, these are not insoluble, for core project activities involve only four departments in two ministries. Organizational arrangements are basically sound, and should contribute to long-term institutionalization of project activities.  However, the TA team has not been adequately integrated into RCUP central staff or with line agencies and the use of catchment area advisors has not worked well; the composition, overall size, and roles of the team need to be reexamined.  The Government of Nepal has created several interagency mechanisms at national, district, and panchayat levels to facilitate coordination; those at the district level are particularly effective, offsetting the difficulties elsewhere. A great deal of effort is being made to foster local participation, but much remains to be done, e.g., in utilizing local governmental institutions and in expanding extension and public information efforts. Degree training is proceeding on schedule, despite delays in constructing facilities, but lacks an interdisciplinary flavor and should be better integrated into the overall scheme of the RCUP. The project should be continued basically as planned but with a periodic review of targets.  Over time, it may be possible to sharpen its focus by reducing or eliminating marginal activities. Sixteen recommendations are made.","Work order no. 4","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-04-1096-00","","4/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Environmental degradation|Natural resource rehabilitation|Watersheds|Natural resource conservation","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN636.pdf","4,426 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","000179 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to train maternal child health aides (MCHA's) for the Government of Tanzania's (GOT) rural MCH/family planning program. Final evaluation, conducted by an outside contractor, covers the period 6/73-3/83 and is based on interviews with project officials and site visits. The project was largely a success.  The targeted 18 MCHA training centers (3 of which were recently upgraded to allow higher-level training of MCHA's) were built, and a two-track training program (curricula for which were improved in 1980) was developed - a 9-month course to upgrade village midwives to MCHA status, and an 18-month pre-service MCHA course for women not already midwives. A combined total of 2,509 women were trained and placed in the field, although upgrading of 72 to Grade B nurses will reduce the number available.  Several teacher-training courses and UNDP-funded continuing education seminars for MCHA's and their supervisors were held, and a successful participant training program benefited 74.  The contractor worked diligently to insure project continuity after its termination. The increase in the number of clinics providing MCH services during the project period was impressive, although family planning - strongly resisted by husbands - continues to be a low priority among service providers and political leaders.  Further, the program's effectiveness is threatened by by far-reaching logistic, supply, and supervision problems and by GOT financial difficulties which have placed the full burden for recurrent program costs at lower levels.  In the critical area of information management, the excellent low-cost recordkeeping system developed early on has deteriorated since 1980, mainly due to a lessened appreciation of the importance of data management and a lack of resolve to undertake it.  An unforeseen problem has been the migration to urban areas of upwardly mobile village women trained under the project.  Nonetheless, the project successfully demonstrated that the shift to rural-based, integrated preventive/curative services delivered by specially trained cadres of paramedical workers contributes to equity in health care and is attuned to Tanzania's limited resources and demographic characteristics. A total of 22 recommendations are made.","Evaluation period: 15-25 Mar 1983","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Maternal child health care|Family planning|Educational centers|Paramedical education|Paramedical midwives|Beneficiary count","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN638.pdf","2,161 KB","001318 - American Public Health Association.

"Evaluates the institutional framework of the Central Tunisia Rural Development (CTRD) project.  Evaluation working paper covers the period 5/79 through mid-1981 and focuses on lessons to be learned regarding the design and management of integrated rural development (IRD) projects; methodology is not specified. Although the project envisaged that a new regional development authority, the Office de Development de la Tunisia Centrale (ODTC), would be responsible for managing all project functions under jurisdiction of the Ministry of Agriculture, this plan was resisted by various MOA units and eventually a ""second-best"" strategy was negotiated wherein ODTC retained responsibility for only certain functions - even then ODTC management involved a large element of coordination.  Thus, a key project lesson is the potential for conflict between a newly created autonomous regional development agency and existing agencies. Other findings/lessons are:  (1) Although TA was provided to help ODTC develop a capacity for regional planning and evaluation and later for rural extension, ODTC's overall institutional development needs were never addressed.  A.I.D.'s response to uncertainty concerning ODTC's absorptive capacity was to load the project agreement with conditions precedent, one of which may have had the negative effect of forcing ODTC to recruit planners without adequately considering their suitability for the job. (2) By focusing TA on certain ""innovative"" activities such as regional planning, A.I.D. actually diverted scarce resources from ODTC's management assistance needs.  (3) Long-range capacity building goals tended to be displaced by short-term imperatives to begin capital projects (irrigation and potable water systems) so as to reduce the ""pipeline"" of unexpended funds.  (4) As a new organization, ODTC was not capable of coordinating the project's applied research approach to testing development concepts and methodologies. CTRD experience clearly suggests that IRD projects should focus first on the institutional development of a management structure, rather than on the technical aspects of project interventions, and should take a more unified approach to management and technical skills training. Choice of a management structure should be tailored to a country's political, administrative and institutional environment.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Integrated regional development|Integrated rural development|Development project design|Development strategies|Technical assistance|Development project management","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN672.pdf","2,462 KB","000153 - USAID.

"Developing countries are increasingly using free zones - geographic areas offering tariff, tax, and/or regulatory relief to businesses in their area - to stimulate the private sector. This report examines existing data on a limited number of free zones, including free trade, export processing, enterprise, and free banking zones, as well as free ports and the Mexican maquiladoras, and the factors conducive to their success or lack of it. Positively, free zones can make a major contribution to the rise of modern, export-oriented, industries by increasing employment, foreign exchange earnings, rates of return, and technology transfer, and have served in some countries (e.g., China) as proving grounds for economic reform.  On the other hand, many zones have failed to stimulate economic activity due to lack of a stable investment climate, unreliable general infrastructure and service delivery, and user-insensitive zone management.  Even in successful zones, linkages to the surrounding economy are often lacking.  Further, since zones seem most successful at the beginning of a country's move away from import substitution, they may in time become less effective as magnets for foreign investment. Finally, changing global economic conditions may soon make traditional zone development strategies obsolete. Several recommendations are included. Appended are case studies, lists of free zones, tables on wages for export processing workers in selected countries, and a list of incentives available in export processing zones.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Free zones|Private enterprises|Economic development|Exports","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL024.pdf","2,432 KB","003494 - Sabre Foundation","","000156 - USAID.

"The history of and future possibilities for A.I.D.involvement in developing local government in Latin America are herein assessed. After a brief resume of the history of local government in Latin America, post-1960 trends toward municipal development and the obstacles to increased decentralization are reviewed.  It is noted that the relative emphasis of the 1960's on rural development largely shifted during the 1970's to urban development as the pace of rural-to-urban migration accelerated and with it the need for greater urban infrastructure.  At the same time, municipal development institutions were established or strengthened in such countries as Costa Rica, Guatemala, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Bolivia, Paraguay, Honduras, and Panama.  The municipalista movement to push for autonomous local government also played a significant role during this period and is addressed likewise. A.I.D. evaluations of its municipal development activities in the 1970's - in the areas of local bank lending for infrastructure and social service subprojects, technical assistance and training, legal and legislative reform, and institutional planning and management - are then reviewed and A.I.D.'s involvement since 1980 assessed.  The last and longest chapter summarizes the effects of the historical, sociocultural, ideological, legal/legislative, political, policy, and bureaucratic frameworks existing in Latin America on local government development and outlines a strategy for future A.I.D. involvement. The author concludes that A.I.D. should build on the potential for local government already established, focusing future efforts, where possible, at the municipal level in preference to other governmental levels.  These efforts should target urban-rural linkages (especially food supply and non-farm employment), energy efficiency, planning in secondary cities experiencing rapid growth, and - to enable real and sustainable autonomy to emerge - financial planning, management, and administration.  The scale of such interventions, it is noted, will depend on local conditions.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","OTR-0085-O-00-3092-00","","11/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Cities and towns|Development strategies|Institution building|Urban development","Latin America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL023.pdf","1,452 KB","","","000156 - USAID.

"Results of studies of the impact of rural electrification (RE) programs in Bolivia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and the Philippines are summarized. Conclusions are as follows:  (1) Programs helped the poor - who valued the programs and comprised a notable percentage of the beneficiaries - to electrify their homes, although their ability to use electricity productively was limited.  (2) Public usage was primarily for lighting, e.g., in streets and public squares; further public usage would require explicit linkage of RE to strong, ongoing social service programs.  (3) Economic impact was generally proportionate to level of development.  Direct impact on agriculture was limited to large and fairly sophisticated operations, although there was a strong indirect impact on farm service industries such as equipment repair and crop processing.  Impact on commerce and industry was greatest in relatively developed areas; complementary interventions such as credit and roads would be needed for there to be an impact in less developed rural areas. (4) The success of RE cooperatives depended on political traditions and support of the central government.  Decisions on the type of organization (public, private, or cooperative) to manage electrical systems should be made in light of these findings and not in view of social participation, on which cooperatives had little impact.  (5) Heavy government subsidies were the most common of the many methods used to achieve financial viability.  Rate schedules were generally progressive and seldom reflected the true costs of service to rural areas, rapid expansion to which may actually endanger financial viability.  U.S. technical standards may be unsuitable and too costly for low Third World consumption levels. Policy implications are that A.I.D. should:  view RE as part of the energy sector and not as an end in itself; obtain clear notions of all costs and benefits (financial, social, political); in view of shrinking budgets, target interventions to its areas of strength; link programs to other development efforts in poorer areas, while realizing that the poorer the area, the less likely it is that RE will enhance development. A 4-page bibliography (1965-81) and several substantive annexes are included.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Electrification|Rural development|Public services|Economic development|Cooperatives|Financing|Development strategies","Bolivia|Costa Rica|Ecuador|Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL027.pdf","4,554 KB","","","000156 - USAID.

"The Haitian-American Community Help Organization (HACHO), founded in 1966 to provide health and community services in resource-poor Northwest Haiti, received A.I.D. funding from that date through 1979.  The vicissitudes and impacts of HACHO - which soon became a focal point for local residents seeking help as well as for donors seeking a vehicle to provide assistance - are herein reviewed. HACHO, which began by providing health services in one small town, soon expanded geographically - into other parts of the Northwest - and sectorally - into community organization, road construction, and later, agricultural extension, irrigation, potable water, and handicrafts.  The primary impact of the HACHO project lay in its provision of basic services where none existed before.  Residents valued its health care, agricultural, and infrastructure programs, a road network constructed by Food for Work teams, and its development of community councils to facilitate service delivery and mobilize local resources and self-help. However, HACHO was also frequently called upon to coordinate donor response to natural disasters, and even though the project's design in later years tried to emphasize production-oriented programs and local capacity building, HACHO's relief activities tended to skew development efforts toward nonsustainable service provision.  The community council movement was fraught with contradictory expectations (regarding self-help vs. dependency on external relief), and HACHO itself suffered from serious organizational and managerial weaknesses:  a centralized decisionmaking structure with headquarters far away in Port-au-Prince, and an inadequate information system, resulting in lack of guidance, continuity, and evaluation. Several lessons emerge:  the difficulty of achieving development and relief objectives within the same program; the need to clearly understand true costs and benefits in sustainable development activities; the necessity of long-term attention to management improvement, as well as long-term donor support, in developing an indigenous organizational capacity; and the vulnerability of integrated rural development projects to external, macro-level constraints.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Community self help|Community development|Institution building|Health care|Disaster relief|Emergency relief","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL025.pdf","2,093 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the Government of Malawi expand its rural piped water system and provide health education.  Special mid-term evaluation covers the period 8/80-8/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with Ministry of Health (MOH), Departments of Lands, Valuation and Water (DLVW), and USAID/M personnel and with beneficiaries. This project - well-conceived, competently managed, adequately supported by the GOM, and either on or ahead of schedule in virtually every aspect - has succeeded in making Malawi's already successful rural water program even better. Project success is due to three key factors. (1) The community has been involved on a scale unequalled elsewhere in Africa.  All activities (planning, resource mobilization, construction, maintenance, etc.) are firmly based on full participation by users. Routine maintenance, for example, is provided solely on a self-help basis and hundreds of km of pipelines have been completely by community volunteers.  (2) DLVW and MOH field staff are sensitive to the needs of and possess the skills to work with communities. (3) Senior staff have been far-seeing and dedicated and political leadership supportive. A decision to reduce the number of water schemes from 23 to 16 has actually strengthened the project, more than doubling the projected target population.  Despite severe staff shortages, the project's technical aspects are appropriate, and inputs have been timely and well-coordinated.  A few correctable problems have occurred in billing, costs and expenditures being otherwise reasonable.  DLVW and MOH staff training, which focus on community needs, have been continued and reinforced by the project. Efforts to develop Malawian engineers capable of taking over the project have shown some success.  Although the planned DLVW Training and Research Unit has not been established, several useful, albeit uncoordinated, studies (e.g., technical design, and water and sanitation behavior) have been conducted. The Health Education and Sanitation Promotion (HESP) program, which is new to Malawi, has made a good beginning, although better MOH-DLVW coordination is needed.  HESP has developed health-related strategies for the water program, trained staff, and begun field tests of laundry slabs and latrines.","Order of technical direction no. 149","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSPE-C-0080","","12/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Health education|Water sanitation|Water supply structures|Community self help|Community participation|Sanitation education|Beneficiary interviews","Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAP059.pdf","5,977 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"Evaluates project to develop and test prototype training materials for primary health care workers.  Final external evaluation covers the period 1981-6/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project staff and LDC health officials. The project has developed a unique and comprehensive three-tiered, competency-based health training system, which focuses on mid-level health workers as the pivotal connection between the upper (health professional) and lower (community health worker) tiers.  The training materials, which have been published as the 35-volume MEDEX Primary Health Care Series, were tested in Pakistan, Guyana, and Lesotho and have proven to be suitable for adaptation and replication in widely different settings (although the process of adaptation may be complicated and time-consuming in some settings).  Other project outputs include reconnaissance visits, training seminars, workshops, and TA. The competency and expertise which have been developed under this project should be exploited fully and rapidly.  There is already significant interest among LDC's in using the MEDEX materials. To ensure full use, the University of Hawaii's Health Manpower Development staff (who developed the materials) should seek marketing expertise and should be responsive to potential users whether they need the complete system or merely specific components.  It is recommended that:  A.I.D. continue support to this project and encourage other projects to use the MEDEX system; training centers be developed; TA and user networks be provided; and plans be made for assessing the training system's cost-effectiveness. The project demonstrates that systems development is costly and time-consuming with numerous unpredictable variables, however, it can be rewarding if the prototype permits easy adaptation and replication, and it is better than financing pieces of a system individually. Measurement of cost-effectiveness is impractical during the testing stage and should be carried out by an independent team during the operational phase.  To be maximally successful, AID/W and the materials developers should achieve better working relationships and every effort should be made to facilitate better communication with Missions.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","6/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Health professionals|Health workers|Medical education|Educational materials","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN732.pdf","2,881 KB","001318 - American Public Health Association.

"Evaluates three projects to foster rural development through small peasant organizations (groupements) in Haiti.  Special evaluation covers the period through 6/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and indepth interviews with project participants and other knowledgable persons. Although all three projects share the same strategy, specific goals and methodologies have varied.  The Gros Morne project, the eldest of the three, began as a conventional rural development project (i.e., building - from outside and above - upon existing institutions), but has evolved into an innovative effort pursuing mainly economic goals without relying much on local leadership. Gros Morne has had spectacular progress in supporting dynamic integrated rural development efforts. Some 800 groupements have been formed (450 still functioning) and good progress has been made in:  nonformal education (an important part of all three projects); literacy training; health services; agricultural credit, extension, and storage; and particularly in animal husbandry. The incomes of both poorer and better-off peasants have increased. The Groupement Pilot Project (GPP) is the most radical of the three, concentrating on peasant autonomy and consciousness raising and providing only advice (not aid).  Although no longer trying to meet all project paper goals, GPP has developed and tested a very successful technique of peasant mobilization, a considerable achievement.  And, while many Gros Morne achievements can be expected to be short-lived, this is not likely true of GPP - its groupements demand a much more regular, dedicated, and time-consuming involvement on the part of members. GPP activities (in, e.g., animal husbandry, agricultural technology, and extension) have had modest income impacts, but of the three projects, GPP is the most on target in terms of benefiting the rural poor.  Both GPP and Gros Morne have model nonformal education activities. The more conventional Chambellan Community Development project works mostly through existing institutions and has few qualms about its close linkage with community councils, which are widely seen as impediments to egalitarian distribution of social and economic benefits in Haiti. Activities have focused mostly on construction (roads, a slaughterhouse, social centers, potable water sites).  Chambellan has had considerable income impacts, but these are skewed toward large landowners.  Local participants remain dependent upon outside initiative and it is likely that once this project is completed, conditions for the poor will deteriorate rapidly.","Executive summary: PD-AAT-347","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Community self help|Peasants|Associations|Beneficiary interviews","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN733.pdf","6,153 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"Evaluates project to encourage low-income housing improvements in rural Honduras.  Special evaluation covers the period 12/81-12/83 and is based on document review and interviews with personnel from USAID/H, the Honduran National Housing Institute (INVA), the Professional Formation Institute of Honduras (INFOP), and financial intermediaries and with project beneficiaries. This well-designed project could serve as a model in the use of existing public and private institutions to provide financial and even technical assistance to rural families for home improvements.  Twelve private, nonprofit institutions (or intermediaries) have signed contracts with INVA and made a total of 2,109 home improvement loans as of 9/30/83, benefiting some 12,000 people.  A Rural House Improvement Unit (RHIU) has been established within INVA's Rural Housing Department and has prepared manuals for management and bookkeeping systems and offered courses in these areas to intermediaries. INFOP has made some 15 presentations (vs. 1,000 targeted) on construction techniques to an unknown number of intermediary promoters and beneficiaries, but it appears unlikely that the targeted 150 promoters will be trained; none of the 3 planned Materials Production Teams have been formed.  INVA, which has been lax in supervising the INFOP contract, should determine how best to use the resources of that institution.  Also, additional training should be provided to RHIU staff so they can offer more TA to intermediaries and INVA should develop a written policy for its rural housing program. Unplanned effects are:  some beneficiaries have organized into workers' associations and marketed their services locally; some intermediaries have required that beneficiaries provide as a loan guarantee a certificate of title to property and others have used private banks to handle the recuperation of loans; beneficiaries have made a greater contribution than had been expected; the use of private institutions as intermediaries has had positive effects; and a spread effect in which the neighbors of beneficiaries make their own home improvements is very likely.","Work order no. 24","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-011-I-24-2068-00","","12/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Home improvement|Housing credit|Rural areas|Beneficiary interviews","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN754.pdf","1,441 KB","000393 - Cooperative Housing Foundation (CHF International)","","008555 - USAID.

"Evaluates irrigation component of a project to strengthen the Irrigation Service of Haiti's Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). Special evaluation covers the period to 8/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with farmers and with USAID/H, MOA, Ministry of Planning (MOP), and contractor personnel. Implementation has suffered delays resulting mainly from poor financial management (the MOA's misallocation of A.I.D. funds led the MOP, which allots P.L. 480 Title I monies for the project, to withhold these funds).  Actual irrigation rehabilitation work is underway only at Dubreuil, where Phase I construction, involving some 225 ha, is expected to be completed by 9/83 (vs. a revised target for the entire Dubreuil system of 925 ha by 9/82.  The Phase I system is adequately designed and constructed (except for a lack of measuring devices) and will over the long term prove cost-effective (farmers are expected to adopt modern technologies and diversify cropping).  Nonetheless, completion of Phase II is justified only if financial and administrative delays are substantially reduced in the future.  Attention to maintenance and watershed protection activities is also essential.  Regarding the former, there is as yet no legally constituted water users' association capable of managing the system, although water user groups have been formed for 9 secondary canals. As regards the other planned irrigation subprojects (SP's) - the Jean Rabel SP was scuttled, the Damien SP has been suspended, the Thomazeau SP was also dropped (athough some feasibility work was completed), and proposals to rehabilitate the Marigot system have been discarded in favor of upgrading five smaller systems which use water from the same river or tributaries.  Topographic work has thus far been completed for only one of these smaller systems (Belle Roche).  It appears advisable to proceed with all these systems eventually. Overall accomplishments of the TA team have been less than they should have been, due not only to the team's late arrival but also to lack of support facilities, counterparts, and construction funds. Nonetheless, the Irrigation Service's competent staff of young engineers have received valuable experience and training through the project.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSAN-C-0058","","9/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigation system construction|Irrigation sites|Beneficiary interviews","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAP208.pdf","2,916 KB","001249 - Utah State University.

"Evaluates project to develop the capacity of four U.S. health institutions - Howard University (HU), Meharry Medical College (MMC), Tuskegee Institute (TI), and Drew Postgraduate Medical School (DPMS) - to assist health program development in LDC's. Special evaluation covers the period 9/78-5/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel/beneficiaries. Progress has varied according to institution, each of which has had a different focus - HU on integrated rural health delivery systems and nutrition planning/ecology; MMC on maternal/child health and nutrition; TI on environmental health/sanitation and integrated rural/community development; and DPMS on the latter and on health planning and management.  Notable achievements have included creation of institutional linkages with African governments and with African and U.S. institutions by DPMS, which also computerized its data center, augmented its faculty, and provided TA to Costa Rica, Kenya, and Egypt; creation of an African Resource Clearinghouse by MMC and of a Health Information Center by TI; agreement by MMC with Malawi to exchange experts and research; study visits to African institutions by TI personnel; hosting of or participation in international seminars and conferences (by all); and development of international health courses or limited training programs by all institutions. Initation of nine such courses has been the main achievement of HU, which otherwise failed to meet its goals of training faculty to assist LDC health projects, engaging in faculty and student exchanges, and researching rural African nutrition/ecology. Leadership changes and subsequent reorganizations have delayed program development at HU, MMC, and TI, while DPMS experienced personnel, funding, and curriculum problems.  Lack of supervision and technical support by A.I.D. was cited as a major problem by each institution, although A.I.D. denies the extent of this criticism. Although most institutions could have have accomplished more, the project's overall impact on them has been positive.  Time and funding extensions to allow further program development are chief among the 16 recommendations made.","Work order no. 24|Related document: PD-AAP-981|Executive summary: PD-AAN-763","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/SOD/PDC-C-0394","","5/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Health care planning|Health care administration|Health delivery|Universities and colleges|Beneficiary interviews","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN764.pdf","1,749 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","000004 - USAID.

"Evaluates training provided under the primary health care component of a project to develop the institutional capacity of the Government of Guatemala's (GOG) Ministry of Health (MOH) to implement an integrated rural health and nutrition program. Special evaluation covers the period to 8/10/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with MOH and USAID/G personnel and with trainers and trainees. Although implementation has been delayed (due to political and bureaucratic factors within the MOH and the GOG), a total of 60 (vs. 95 targeted) auxiliary nurses, 48 (vs. 75) rural health technicians, 577 (vs. 1,500) rural health promoters, and 610 (vs. 975) comadrones have been trained.  Training is by objectives and task-oriented.  Trainers are competent and the training is generally of good quality, although the training of comadrones (by auxiliary nurses) is weak compared to other training areas. Impressive accomplishments have been made in adaptation and revision of training materials, standardized services and training norms, and training guides; all personnel have been trained in the use of these materials. However, due to the fact that a supervision/information system has not yet been implemented, neither the performance of the trained personnel at the community level, nor their impact on service utilization and coverage can be assessed.  Training evaluation methodologies are also lacking and the MOH has failed to provide adequate support services such as transportation, per diems, and training materials.  Other problems have included insufficient staffing, competing task assignments, and the severely curtailed implementation time frame.  Area medical chiefs report an imminent shortage of personnel to train further groups of community-level workers.  Problems facing the project as a whole include:  poor orientation toward project objectives by area and district physicians, lack of field support for rural health technicians, and the MOH's failure to develop a communication flow among project levels or to decentralize decision authority.  Numerous recommendations are made.","Evaluation period: 25 Jul-10 Aug 1983","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","10/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Paramedical education|Health professional education|Educational materials|Rural areas|Beneficiary interviews","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN781.pdf","1,664 KB","001318 - American Public Health Association.

"Evaluates project to upgrade the Government of the Congo's (GRPC) nutrition education (NE) programs.  Special mid-term evaluation covers the period through 9/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and indepth interviews. Notable progress has been made - a baseline nutrition survey has been executed, GRPC personnel have been trained as project supervisors and animateurs, NE materials based on results of the baseline survey have been developed for staff and community training efforts, and a documentary resource center created for professionals and students. Several weak points, however, have lessened the project's potential impact. (1) The 5-day training course for animateurs is too short and too narrowly conceived and there is no provision for inservice animateur training, sensitization of higher-level GRPC officials, or overseas training of project administrators.  (2) Current procedures discourage active participation by project supervisors and no support system for the latter has been established.  (3) There is need for technical innovations such as wider use of scales and child growth monitoring charts, better use of child health-control cards, more well-defined and active village-level NE, clearer lesson plans, and given the shortage of food, the development of community-based activities such as cooperative management of food mills.  (4) The library is too small, lacks a full-time librarian and funds to edit NE materials, and efforts to publicize it need to be followed up. (5) A comprehensive NE strategy is lacking.  Particular problems include the need for more lessons and radio programs (e.g., through Radio Rurale) and fewer posters and the lack of resources for conducting food demonstrations.  (6) The project has not been firmly installed in any GRPC institution and no mechanism has been developed to ensure continuous participation by all concerned entities.  (7) A detailed and realistic evaluation plan is needed to enable project personnel to assess the cost-effectiveness of different NE techniques and determine if NE can improve nutrition status at a reasonable cost. Despite these problems, a second project phase - focusing on strengthening rather than extending current activities - is recommended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSAN-C-0209","","11/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Nutrition education|Nutrition|Mass media|Extension services|Paramedical education|Nutrition research|Health surveys|Maternal child health care|Educational materials|Radio|Nutrition improvement|Cost benefit analysis|Institution building","Congo PR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN795.pdf","1,454 KB","000657 - Education Development Center, Inc.

"Evaluates project to develop a malaria control program (MCP) in Zanzibar, Tanzania.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/81-10/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with Government of Zanzibar (GOZ) and project staff. The project is two years behind schedule due to:  the delayed arrival of the project manager (in 5/83); the slow recruitment of MCP staff; and the lack of a full-time health educator and of GOZ-approved annual/long-term work plans.  However, some progress has been made.  A number of AID-supplied commodities have been received (e.g., land rovers, trucks, and lab, office, and audiovisual equipment); insecticides (DDT, Malathion) and antimalarial drugs have been ordered. Also, 49 of a targeted 83 malaria agents (MA's) and supervisors have been hired; 41 MA's have attended three workshops in registration techniques, blood-slide preparation, and chloroquine use/dosage. Supervisory staff have participated in an observation tour of Sudan and two international health conferences, and eight microscopists have received inservice training.  However, only one of five Master's degree candidates in public health has begun U.S. study, planned training materials have not been prepared, and health education has been limited to the preparation of radio/television spots and to giving malaria prevention lectures to school children. Although MA's only began active case detection activities in 11/83, their performance so far has been satisfactory.  Most health centers/rural dispensaries have adequate antimalarial drug supplies; however, only one of nine health centers visited was properly administering chloroquine to malaria patients. Spraying operations have been limited to larviciding with only marginal effect; the planned 3/84 spray may be hampered by delays in procuring insecticides and training spray personnel and by inadequate planning/equipment.  The project entomologist has conducted limited susceptibility tests on Anopheles gambiae and prepared an entomology work plan. Key recommendations are to revise the project's implementation schedule and targets, especially in view of widespread parasite resistance to chloroquine and increasing signs of DDT-resistance by the vector mosquito.","Attached to PD-AAN-796","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Malaria|Anopheles mosquitoes|Chloroquine|Malathion|DDT|Insecticides|Parasites|Pesticide spraying|Disease treatment|Disease prevention and control|Drug therapy|Disease detection|Health education","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAN796A.pdf","4,122 KB","008612 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to assist the Royal Thai Government (RTG) to implement anti-malarial measures in rural areas and develop its institutional capabilities in malaria control.  Final technical evaluation covers the period 8/79-7/83 and is based on site visits and interviews with USAID/T and RTG officials and with village volunteers. Although many project targets have been met, malaria remains a major health problem in Thailand due to internal population movements, drug resistant parasites, and behavioral changes in vector populations. Malaria spraying has been less complete than planned (67.6% of target in 1982), largely because of household refusals.  However, public acceptance has been gradually increasing due mainly to an extensive health education campaign. Showing of movies has in particular been correlated with increased acceptance of spraying, while posters and cassette tapes have also been well received. The training capacity of the National Anti-Malaria Program has markedly improved.  Training has been provided to over 22,000 village volunteers and to 580 malaria clinic workers, both through pre-service and refresher courses, as well as to other public health personnel. U.S. academic training and observation tours for supervisory personnel have been somewhat less successful, due variously to a lack of candidates, competing WHO fellowships, and internal delays.  The Malaria Training Center at Phraphutthabat has undergone major improvements and expansion, doubling its capacity (to 58 students), and malaria training manuals and curricula have been revised.  Major capital improvements have also been made, with positive impacts, at 3 research facilities, 3 unit offices, and a second training center. Eight applied research projects have been initiated (4 remain in progress) and several field trials conducted to develop future malaria control strategies.  Although the hypotheses tested in the 4 completed studies were directly relevant to malaria control, results have had only minimal impact on the project due to research design and control problems, including lack of direct supervision, the shortness of the study period, and a failure to follow protocol and analyze data completely. Detailed recommendations address needed technical and operational improvements in the RTG's anti-malaria program.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Malaria|Disease prevention and control|Disease research|Health professional education|Paramedical education|Health education|Training centers","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN798.pdf","1,752 KB","008613 - USAID.

"The impact of the On-Farm Water Development Project, jointly undertaken from 1968-74 by A.I.D. and Turkey's General Directorate of Soils and Water (TOPRAKSU) in the fertile Aydin region, is reviewed. Implementation stressed the concepts of the ""farmer as planner"" and of ""learning by doing"" and focused on various forms of training designed to help farmers level, drain, and otherwise improve their land; promote local manufacture of farm machinery; and encourage private contractors to do land leveling. Overall, the project was very successful.  A 1971 study of four project farms showed an average increase of 1,500 kg/ha in cotton yields and an average decrease of TRL1,000/ha in production costs - a return on investment of over 200% in the first season. Land improvement not only doubled yields in the traditional season, but also created a second season for a second crop, leading to a boom in fruit and vegetable production.  The project also stimulated local production of farm machinery, which is now well established, and a growth in the number of private contractors conducting land leveling activities.  TOPRAKSU engineers trained under the project (74 in the United States, 219 in-country) carried the spirit of the project with them throughout Turkey. Indirect benefits included widespread electrification, improved nutrition, and upgraded women's roles.  Negatively, increased distribution of water led to deterioration of the fig crop (due to fig sensitivity to moisture) and a spread in crop diseases, while occasional overproduction has led to still unmet needs in crop forecasting, packaging, and marketing. The project taught that:  demonstration projects are more likely to succeed (and thus be replicated) when designed in close cooperation with the farmer/manufacturer/contractor; farmers are more apt to experiment if risks are limited; a complex project should be modularized and decisionmaking delegated to the lowest practical level, with a simple evaluation and feedback system; technology must be easily adaptable and repairable locally; and help may be rendered more effectively by increasing employment and demand for goods than by direct intervention. Appendices offer further treatment of individual points.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Water management|Irrigation|Land improvement|Irrigation equipment|Manufacturing|Technology transfer|Agricultural production|Employment|Local level","Turkey","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL029.pdf","1,945 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates subproject of the Non-Formal Education (NFE) Project to establish in Ecuador a National Rural Training System (SNCR) aimed at improving and integrating public and private efforts to provide NFE training to campesinos.  Special evaluation covers the period 10/81-3/83 and is based on interviews and site visits. The project has been delayed by problems in institutionalizing the implementing agency, the National Institute for Campesino Training (INCCA).  This and the devaluation of the sucre have allowed only 20% of A.I.D.'s $2.5 million contribution to be utilized.  Because the Government of Ecuador's (GOE) integral rural development (DRI) program and INCCA were still being organized within the new civilian government at the time the project agreement was signed (8/80), three conditions were attached to the grant.  By 9/8l, two of these - establishment of INCCA within the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG) and of the multisectoral, multi-institutional council for the project - had been fulfilled.  By 3/83, however, the third condition, that INCCA establish policies for the project's Rural Training Assistance Fund, was still not fulfilled; these policies have in fact been elaborated in opposition to INCCA.  Only within the last 2 months has INCCA been given autonomy and hired new staff and has the new MAG press become operational, permitting production of targeted materials.  Even so, problems remain. These include the uncertainty of the GOE's financial commitment to the project; budgetary constraints limiting INCAA to DRI activities; and the inadequacy of the personnel assigned to INCCA by the Division of Campesino Development. The major recommendation is to extend the project l8 months to allow it to be developed as a multinational model and permit execution of other recommendations, e.g., to improve the make-up of the multi-institutional advisory council; identify public and private institutions involved in DRI and determine their resources for NFE; and strengthen INCCA's linkages with collaborating entities.","Attached to PD-AAN-803-A","Special Evaluation","Documents","518-1054-C-00-30-36-0","","3/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Education|Rural areas|Institution building|Nonformal education|Technical assistance","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAN803A.pdf","3,962 KB","","","008538 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop a program to provide vocational education to disadvantaged children and adolescents in Ecuador and create an Instructional Resource Center (IRC) to facilitate personnel training in Ecuador and other Latin American countries. Special evaluation covers the period 1/80-1/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel and participants. Project objectives were met.  Fourteen instructional modules were developed and 2,111 persons took part in project training programs. Courses and conferences on the care of retarded children were presented to 377 families (vs. a target of 300) in different regions of the country and 63 students (vs. a target of 60) attended vocational training workshops.  In addition, a number of handicapped workers were placed in jobs in the community.  The planned IRC was established and served 1,693 registered and 3,696 nonregistered users, providing consultation, audiovisual resources, and materials development services. It also provided high school and university students and teachers with sources of special education information.  The IRC's 3,500-volume collection makes it the main source of information in Ecuador on special education.  Two new educational centers were established and existing centers provided with technical assistance in the form of special education training programs for center personnel and teachers.","Attached to PD-AAN-802","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Vocational training|Mental retardation|Children|Youth|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data plus","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAN802A.pdf","1,012 KB","","","008538 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the Government of Cameroon (GOC) develop the capacity of the Institute of Agronomic Research (IRA) to conduct adaptive research on maize, rice, sorghum, and millet and extend research results to farmers.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/79-10/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with USAID/C, IRA, TA, and GOC staff. Although the project has only been underway for less than 2 years, both the extent and quality of research has been excellent.  A highly-qualified TA staff of 10 (cereal breeders, agronomists, and administrators), 8 with Ph.D.'s, has been assembled and 10 Cameroonian counterparts have been recruited (5 are attending U.S. undergraduate/graduate training programs, 2 have recently returned and been assigned, and 2 are set to go). Also, the project is collaborating with an impressive number of Cameroonian and international institutions. Due to there being only one testing and liaison unit (TLU) (at Bambui), the relative newness of the project, and the lack of TLU staff agricultural training, there has been only limited progress in facilitating research extension to farmers.  However, the TLU has conducted field tests of IRA research results on parastatal, tribal, and traditional farms; an agro- and socio-economic survey of farmers in the northwest province (another is underway); and 3 well-received courses for Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) extension personnel; they also have provided MOA village agents with mini-kits for establishing demonstration farm plots. The project has been hampered by a lack of qualified counterparts, inadequate IRA facilities (e.g., office/work space, seed houses), and, most seriously, insufficient research field and lab equipment (the latter partly due to GOC customs delays). Cameroonian farmers/agriculturalists are very receptive to research results; thus the project must ensure that the potential of new agronomic practices and plant varieties to increase crop yield has been fully validated.  Also, the TLU's must be careful not to usurp the extension function of the MOA.  Recommendations include to:  add 2 TLU's at Ekona and Nkolbisson; provide adequate facilities and equipment; and hire additional TA staff.","Attached to PD-AAN-808","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Cereals|Agricultural research|Crop production|Cereal crops|Rice|Maize|Millet|Sorghum|Agricultural extension","Cameroon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAN808A.pdf","2,911 KB","008524 - USAID.

"Evaluates marketing systems component of a project to develop and implement more efficient marketing practices in Jamaica.  Special evaluation covers the period to 12/83 and was conducted onsite. The project as designed has proven infeasible.  The original building designs for the first 2 or 3 of the 25 planned Producer Market Organizations/Agricultural Grading Stations (PMO/AGS) were too elaborate and planned equipment too costly, and the concept employed in constructing PMO/AGS facilities resulted in their isolation, rather than integration, into a complete assembly, transportation, and distribution system.  Further, there have been misunderstandings and barriers to developing effective PMO's, which, according to contractual agreements with the Ministry of Agriculture, must precede development of an AGS. To date, feasibility studies have only been completed for 5 PMO/AGS; none have yet become operational.  Finally, the plan to establish 4 Sub-Wholesale Distribution Markets (SWDM) to handle produce and meat at redistribution centers has been found impractical, although the concept of additional wholesale marketing facilities is sound. Recommendations are to concentrate on establishing 6 rather than 25 PMO/AGS facilities (at Christiana, Southfield, Busby Park, Ebony Park, Guy's Hill, and Douglas Castle), with others coming online as the first six begin operating efficiently; and to use SWDM funds for three wholesale markets - two wholesale/retail livestock auctions (one with and one without an abbatoir) and a subterminal meat and produce wholesale market in Kingston (by conversion of the facility of the Agriculture Marketing Cooperative).  The fourth SWDM should be held in reserve for a possible wholesale subterminal market for meat and produce in Montego.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSAN-CA-0265","","12/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural product marketing|Wholesale marketing|Marketing facilities|Technical assistance","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN815.pdf","447 KB","000574 - University of Idaho.

"Evaluates project to establish a Freshwater Fish Hatchery and Extension Training Center in Central Luzon, the Philippines. Final external evaluation covers the period 11/79-11/83 and is based on site visits and interviews with USAID/P and project personnel and with beneficiaries. This well-conceived project should achieve all of its outputs eventually, although - due to a recent drought and an 18-month construction delay - not by project end (2/84).  Hatchery facilities are now virtually complete, personnel are well trained and competent, and production of Tilapia nilotica fingerlings and breeders have been underway since 5/82, with a yield to date of 3.1 million seed. Distribution of smaller fingerlings, propagation of the common carp, and decreased time between fingerling crops should enable achievement of the targeted 8-10 million seed a year. Extension is also on track; a number of training activities have been held for extensionists and farmers, outreach techniques have been extremely effective, and extension workers are well motivated, trained, and accepted.  The fish delivery system has been successful, with new handling and transportation methods utilized; a centralized delivery system, however, and higher prices, competitive with the private sector, are recommended. Some 2.5 million tilapia fingerlings and breeders were delivered to 590 farmer/cooperators during 1983; these numbers will rise as production does.  Firm linkages have been developed between the extension center and other Central Luzon extension activities, and these bonds should be further strengthened. Management and logistical support, on the other hand, have been weak, due primarily to the lack of visible leaders in the hatchery management unit and the administrative unit.  Better internal coordination and better staff opportunities for professional advancement are key needs. Significant benefits could be derived from a project extension if overall management is improved.  Numerous specific recommendations are made and a five-year management program is outlined.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","DAN-1314-A-00-2005-00","","11/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Inland fisheries|Fish breeding|Fish hatcheries|Fish pond construction|Beneficiary interviews","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN816.pdf","2,029 KB","001533 - Auburn University.

"Evaluates integrated rural development project in Nepal's Rapti Hills Zone.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/80-8/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with villagers and with Government of Nepal (GON) and project personnel. Most activities have only gotten underway within the past 18 months. The Agriculture Development Bank's Small Farmer Development Program is off to a good start; loans are also being made to individual entrepreneurs.  New varieties of wheat have been introduced, livestock and veterinary services are beginning, and adult education is having an impact on attitudes and skills, particularly among women.  The Appropriate Technology Unit is actively promoting private marketing of household and farm innovations (biogas units, water turbine mills, etc.).  Access road construction is progressing, with some delays, and 58 rural works projects are either underway or planned.  Institutional development and training are occurring in the crucial area of district planning and budgeting, and the project financial management system is working well.  Other activities include cottage industries, forestry, soil conservation, and renewable resources. While GON policies and actions are generally favorable, improvements in commitment, planning, and action are needed in five areas:  (1) ecology - to reverse environmental degradation caused by the household production system and by development in general; (2) institutional trends - the Decentralization Act should be fully implemented, giving districts clear authority and capacity for their development programs, and private enterprise should be encouraged; (3) stronger focus on increasing household income; (4) improved incentives for private enterprise and for government workers; and (5) quick attention to family planning programs to stem the rapid population growth in the zone.  With concerted attention to these issues, there is a good chance for accelerated economic growth and justification for a long-term cooperative program.  If GON commitment is not forthcoming during the next 2 years, the project should be terminated. Recommendations are made addressing individual project activities and further development needs.  Included are GON reactions to the evaluation conclusions.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-2085-00","","8/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Rural development|Decentralization|Institution building|Beneficiary interviews","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN820.pdf","2,178 KB","","","008583 - USAID.

"During the past decade A.I.D. has increasingly provided assistance to local units of government.  This study, based primarily on review of A.I.D. documentation of 63 local government projects, addresses three key issues:  the projects' effectiveness in enhancing local authority, their impacts on the private sector, and their success in achieving local development per se. The authors show that emphasis on local government has grown partly as a result of dissatisfaction with centralized public planning and implementation and partly due to country-specific and Mission-specific factors.  A.I.D.'s local government portfolio consists of a hodgepodge of program types (decentralization initiatives, area development programs, components of larger programs, and direct assistance); institutional arrangements (including indirect assistance through regional or national entities), and strategies (management training, revenue generation, financial studies, and participant training). The projects' effectiveness in increasing local autonomy is likewise mixed, and appears to be a function of central government commitment, preexisting local capacity, and stage of decentralization. Paradoxically, it is often necessary to increase national strength temporarily to achieve the long-term objective of decentralized autonomy.  Generally, local government projects have lent support to private sector development, both directly and indirectly, although in a few instances the private sector may have been displaced.  The issue is seldom addressed in A.I.D. documentation, however. Capacity building within local governments, while not easy, is a valuable strategy in situations where these governments play a key role in decentralization efforts or are needed to implement A.I.D. assistance.  However, local government support should be viewed as a means to achieve sectoral objectives and not as a goal in itself. Finally, the authors caution that as the importance of local governments varies from country to country, the formal statements found in project documentation are of little use in assessing specific situations.  Informal behind the scenes patterns of decisionmaking are far more important.

"The Helmand Valley Development Project in Afghanistan, a complex effort - assisted by 25 A.I.D. and predecessor agency projects (1949-79) - to settle new farmers on desert lands reclaimed by irrigation, is herein reviewed. Although often accounted a failure, the project did spur impressive growth in agricultural productivity and income.  The amount of land under cultivation increased from 77,000 to 145,000 ha, 5,500 new families were settled in the valley, fertilizers and high-yield varieties were brought into widespread use, and double cropping increased dramatically.  Average farm income increased by as much as ten times.  By 1975, however, inadequate attention to drainage and salinization and failure to adequately train farmers in water management (as more settlers arrived and the project focus shifted from irrigation to integrated rural development) began to slow income increases. Long-time residents dealt with these problems better than did new settlers. Still, even in areas where salinity was severe, income remained well above pre-project levels. Nonetheless, the increased crop yields were not enough to significantly improve Afghanistan's export situation.  Social services (some of which the United States was responsible for) failed to mitigate the negative impacts of severe salinization and waterlogging - impoverishment, illness, and outmigration. The project taught that:  mixing export production and resettlement goals makes achievement of either unlikely; social services must be given high priority and integrated with other activities, but crop production gains must be consolidated before positive social impacts can be sustained; successful nomadic settlement programs must provide strong economic incentives, adequate social services, and effectively communicated agricultural information; and close integration of donor and host country activities and goals is essential.  The success of A.I.D. activities in such a project depends on the success of the effort as a whole.  Thus, provision must be made from the outset for all essential elements. Appendices include an analysis of four farm economic surveys conducted in the Valley between 1963 and 1978 and a 41-item bibliography (1955-1980).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigation|Population resettlement|Agricultural development|Integrated rural development|Deserts|Social services","Afghanistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL028.pdf","1,362 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the capacity of Morocco's Ministry of Handicrafts and Social Affairs (MAAS) to improve skill-training opportunities for low-income youths.  Special mid-term evaluation covers the period through 3/83 and is based on interviews with project and Moroccan personnel, document review, and site visits. Most activities are behind schedule.  Although the National Institute of Social Action (INAS) has been established and has provided short- (2-4 week) and long-term (2-year) training to, respectively, 159 and 103 midlevel MAAS personnel, the INAS still lacks legal status, students have no libraries or textbooks, no placement assistance will be provided to the first (6/83) graduating class (43 persons), and lack of information on the jobs these students will perform indicates that INAS curricula cannot be revised to reflect relevant skills. None of the five planned pilot skills-training centers for women are yet operative, nor, due to project design ambiguities, have students been identified.  There is discussion of training monitrices, or alternatively, of training poor local women and foregoing replication of the pilot centers throughout the country. Participant training is also behind schedule.  Of 14 persons targeted, 3 have received training in France and are now teaching at INAS, 1 is completing studies in France, 1 has dropped out, and 5 are preparing to depart for the United States; no plans have been made for the remaining 4 slots.  Delays in participant training have partially affected the planned establishment of a MAAS evaluation unit, still far from developed. The 13 vocational training centers run by PCV's, on the other hand, are well on target; some 900 young men will have been trained by Summer 1983.  With PCV's due to depart soon, replacement Moroccan teachers must be appointed immediately. Project experience shows the need for:  increased care during the design phase in order to avoid inaccuracies and discrepancies that might complicate implementation; tangible evidence on the potential of each party to meet their commitments to the project; and more frequent monitoring and evaluation.  Specific recommendations address project deficiencies.","Attached to PD-AAN-855|French ed.: PD-AAR-801","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Management training|Educational facilities|Institution building","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAN855A.pdf","2,569 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"Evaluates project to integrate women into the Moroccan Ministry of Labor's (MOL) industrial and commercial centers.  Final evaluation, prepared by an outside consultant, covers the period 9/79-5/83 and is based on document review and site visits. The project's overall impact was positive.  The skills selected for the pilot training centers of the MOL's Office of Technical Training and Job Development (OFPPT) were appropriate, trainees readily found fitting employment, and the curricula (but not the skills) were periodically improved, although the presence of a project staff member at the pilot locations could have avoided logistical problems.  AID-funded equipment proved a plus, although at 28% of the total budget a special procurement company was advisable.  Training of teachers - including women - for the centers was mainly conducted on an informal, on-the-job basis by AMIDEAST, the U.S. contractor.  Formal placement and follow-up activities were less successful.  Although 70% of the trainees found jobs, this was due more to individual efforts than to systematic procedure.  There has been little follow-up. AMIDEAST's two, relatively high-cost technical studies on sociocultural constraints to employing women technicians in industry were of questionable value. Of 23 U.S. trainees, all but the last three have completed their coursework.  The 10 one-year trainees returned to Morocco, but only one of the 6 Master's candidates did so.  Careful selection of participants is essential to insure that training can be capably completed and that trainees will return to work for the sponsoring institution.  The latter, in turn, should identify positions and define job descriptions for participants in advance.  A.I.D. should not allow participants to begin training without clearly providing to support them for its duration. AMIDEAST's performance could have been better; A.I.D. should assess host country contracting capabilities in advance.  A.I.D. should also ensure that all project documents are consistent and accurate so as to preclude ambiguities in implementation responsibilities.  Also, extra attention to planning and timing start-up is needed in projects of this kind to avoid disrupting teachers' schedules.","Attached to PD-AAN-856|French ed.: PD-AAR-802","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Education|Women|Vocational training|Technical training|Curriculum|Industrial occupations|Employment|Employment services|Teacher training|Participants","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAN856A.pdf","3,473 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"Evaluates CARE project to strengthen nutrition and health education programs in the Congo.  Special evaluation covers the period 1/80-9/83 and is based on site visits and interviews with USAID/C, other U.S., CARE/C, and Government of Congo (GOC) officials. While well-conceived and managed, the project has underestimated the effort needed for a complex educational campaign.  Although CARE has trained 266 of 300 targeted animateurs and their supervisors, animateur training has been inadequate for a variety of reasons - e.g., the education levels of most animateurs, the complexity of the subject matter, the failure to use experienced GOC personnel as trainers, the course's limited scope and its limited emphasis on the local milieu and on practical messages to deliver to the people, and differences among the various GOC units from which animateurs are drawn. Further, although a supervisory system has been put into place, specific terms of reference and divisions of responsibility have not been spelled out and no system of professional support established.  Many supervisors have had little time for field supervision and some have had difficulty in getting authorization to supervise animateurs from GOC units other than their own. A more indepth baseline survey and a more imaginative approach would have resulted in a more suitable and cost-effective mix of media for disseminating nutrition and health information, i.e., less emphasis on posters and more on creating stories and airing radio broadcasts. Further, animateurs are unable to improvise on the well-organized educational guide provided them, while various factors have precluded food demonstrations, which have important educational potential.  Nor was evidence seen of scales or systematic growth monitoring.  Finally, the project library, although augmented, has been insufficiently used due to lack of a full-time librarian and of funds for editing educational materials, unsuitable physical accomodations, and limited publicity efforts. A second phase of the project, focusing on strengthening rather than expanding existing activities, is recommended; 38 specific recommendations address individual aspects.","Attached to PD-AAN-857","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Nutrition education|Health education|Paramedical education|Educational materials|Libraries|Community health workers|Supervisors","Congo PR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAN857A.pdf","4,359 KB","","","008532 - USAID.

"Evaluates child nutrition programs in Kinshasa, Zaire, that are supported by P.L. 480 Title II.  Special evaluation covers the period 7/81-8/83 and is based site visits and reviews of child growth records and other documents, supplemented by earlier Centre National de Planification de Nutrition (CEPLANUT) survey data from three zones. Focus is on the relative impacts of various approaches to child malnutrition. Although CEPLANUT survey data show that overall malnutrition in recipient children aged 0-5 decreased significantly between 9/78 and 12/82, child malnutrition is still alarmingly high.  In 12/82, the four largest child nutrition programs - sponsored by the Catholic Archdiocese (CA), Catholic Relief Services (CRS), Mama Yemo Hospital, and the Salvation Army (SA) - were reaching 64,000 children aged 0-5, of whom 18% were malnourished.  These figures, however, represent only 14% of Kinshasa's children and only 7% of malnourished children. Most nutrition-related programs are connected to health centers. One type, preschool consultations (PC's), offers weight and growth measurements, nutrition and health education, health services, and low-priced take-home food, during monthly visits. CRS PC's offer minimal on-site feeding and large amounts of take-home food, whereas, CA centers offer very small amounts of take-home food.  Analysis of attendance and growth records (the latter were not consistently well maintained) showed that neither type of PC reduced child malnutrition. A second type of nutrition program (sponsored primarily by CA, SA, and CEPLANUT) consists of special sessions for malnourished children, who come to the centers 1-6 days a week for weighing, nutrition counseling and education, intensive on-site feeding, and small amounts of take-home food.  Comparisons of growth records for children participating in these sessions with those for children in PC programs showed that children in the special sessions did far better. Differences were most striking for younger children (aged 12-17 months) and for the severely malnourished (65% weight for age or less). Difference in type of nutrition program center, however, had no effect on levels of malnutrition in immediately surrounding neighborhoods.","Attached to PD-AAN-852","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Infant nutrition|Child nutrition|Food for Peace|Food aid programs|Child feeding programs|Beneficiary count","Congo DR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAN852A.pdf","835 KB","","","009951 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to encourage Moroccan experts to undertake social and economic research that can provide an analytical basis for development projects.  Special evaluation covers the period 5/79-10/83 and is based on document review and extensive interviews with USAID/M and Moroccan personnel and with researchers. Due largely to a change in implementation responsibility, the project has become more significant and relevant than originally planned.  When internal political and administrative problems at the Rectorate of Mohammed V University, the original implementor, forestalled progress, responsibility was transferred (at USAID/M's insistence) to the newly created National Center for the Coordination and Planning of Scientific and Technological Research (CNCPRST).  Under CNCPRST direction, the project - which previously focused on obtaining a series of unrelated research reports - has evolved into an effort to build an institutional capacity for multidisciplinary research coordination. At present, 38 research projects (vs. 60 planned) have been approved for project funding.  Of these, 17 are from ""Phase I"" and should be completed soon, and 21 represent new efforts, 7 of which should end in 1984, 5 in 1985, and 9 in 1986.  The majority are long-term research efforts being completed as part of the requirements for B.S., M.S., or Ph.D. degrees. The project, if extended, can make a significant contribution to the development and institutionalization of applied research in Morocco.  It is recommended that future activities focus on strengthening CNCPRST, rather than merely augmenting or completing ongoing research activities. Lessons learned are:  (1) An appropriate institutional context should be defined at the project's outset and kept in perspective as activities evolve.  (2) There is too much pressure in development projects to do things on time; waiting until opportunities arise is a legitimate strategy.  (3) The value of a project cannot be measured in dollars and cents; many small projects are highly cost-effective.

"Final Mission report (8/31/77-3/31/83) on a subproject - of the Mahaweli Ganga Irrigation Project - to improve on-farm water management in Sri Lanka. Project success varied by component activity from near total to only minimal.  Research was hampered by a lack of Government of Sri Lanka (GSL) counterparts.  Progress in developing land preparation and leveling methodologies was excellent and progress in using graded terraces with furrowed basins and graded furrows for irrigation was good.  Some progress was made in crop/soil management and ground water hydrology research, but little was accomplished in farm demonstration and training activities, surface water hydrology research, water balance studies (still continuing), and structures and flow measurement activities.  The success of data collection activities also varied - reports were prepared on 8 of the project's 15 special research subprojects (an additional report is in draft form), but only two seasonal reports on on-farm research activities at the Kalankuttiya farm were completed.  Further, since the termination of A.I.D. TA in 9/82, little has been done to implement recommendations made in the mid-term evaluation to continue research work at Kalankuttiya, thus confirming the conclusion drawn in the first evaluation that the GSL was not adequately commited to the project, the purpose of which - farmer adoption of improved water management technologies - was not achieved. The project taught the need to:  (1) evaluate the availability and commitment of research staff and tailor the project to the latter as supplemented by TA; (2) refocus the project when staffing problems occur; (3) report on research results in a timely manner; (4) thoroughly investigate the capabilities of research organizations and avoid parallel and duplicate efforts; (5) supplement basic research with follow-up and outreach activities in order to provide farmers with viable alternatives to traditional rice cultivation systems; (6) maintain close collaboration with related agencies - in this case, the Department of Agriculture's Research and Extension Division.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","On farm water management|Agricultural research|Irrigation|Host country cooperation|Limited data","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN870.pdf","320 KB","008606 - USAID.

"How can governments foster the private sector?  To help answer this question, six countries - Malawi, Cameroon, Costa Rica, Thailand, the Dominican Republic, and Sri Lanka - are herein compared in terms of economic development, international trade, economic policy and political economy, trends in mobilization and allocation of capital and human capital, and allied issues such as the development of entrepreneurial skills and the role of small businesses. Although all of the governments professed to support the private sector, actual interventions varied.  Positive actions included investing in infrastructures which are complementary to private production processes, contributing to the supply of savings and channeling donor assistance (preferably on concessionary terms), and improving the country's human capital, although it is probably wise for governments to focus on general education rather than on specific occupational requirements.  Pragmatic leadership - requiring public entities to perform without subsidies or special assistance - is also important, especially in countries where resources are meager and private investors few. On the other hand, governments should not try to control or regulate prices, establish quotas, or otherwise alter free-market functions to help finance social welfare programs; if they do, large-scale problems can quickly emerge, as Costa Rica and Sri Lanka have learned.  This is especially true in regard to agriculture - marketing boards, established to stabilize prices for small producers, have in fact been used for taxation purposes, resulting in reduced output and a worsened economic situation. Finally, except where there are clear economies of scale and the potential for a natural monopoly, as in public utilities, governments should probably not own companies or producing units. Parastatals' lack of the discipline of the marketplace can lead to disastrous long-term implications, as a number of African countries have already witnessed.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Economic development|Private enterprises|Government policy|Agricultural development|Prices","Cameroon|Costa Rica|Dominican Republic|Malawi|Sri Lanka|Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL031.pdf","2,454 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates three projects to develop irrigation systems and supporting farmer services in the Philippines' Bicol River Basin. Special evaluation covers the period 1975-9/83 and is based on site visits and interviews with project personnel. All three projects - despite their various problems - have the potential to deliver a reliable water supply to farmers.  The irrigation systems installed have been of sound technical design (to achieve and maintain these design standards, however, will require additional time and investment), land reform has been implemented, local offices have increased their capacity for management and coordination, and project interventions have produced visible increases in tax revenues, land values, and rice yields (the latter, however, generally have not increased to expected levels).  However, development of irrigation associations (IA's) is seriously behind schedule at two of the three sites.  The expectations of the National Irrigation Association (NIA) and of other Philippine agencies regarding farmers' ability to run the irrigation systems were unrealistic. Farmer training, although given priority in all three projects, has had problems with content, timing, and lack of follow-up. The Libmanan-Cabusao project (officially completed in 1981, although much work remains to be done) faces serious technical and institutional problems, which if not addressed soon will result in loss of the investment that has been made.  The irrigation system is currently operating at less than 50% efficiency.  IA development was initially ignored as an objective and later contracted out to private institutions.  Thus far, farmer participation in IA's has not exceeded 65%. The Bula-Minalabac Land Consolidation project has been extremely successful in achieving farmer cooperation, as evidenced by high rates of farmer adoption of the technology package, payment of irrigation fees, and participation in IA's (the latter exceeding 90%). Construction, however, is behind schedule due to delays in funding and difficulties with contractor performance. The Rinconada project is slightly ahead of schedule in irrigation development and is devoting more effort to IA development, which was initially ignored.  Nonetheless, restrictive IA bylaws have limited farmer participation to less than 20%. Numerous recommendations are made.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigation system construction|Community participation|Associations|Agricultural development","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN879.pdf","3,404 KB","008592 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish an integrated medical education and health services program in 5 governorates bordering Egypt's Suez Canal. Special evaluation covers the period 6/81-10/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with USAID/E and Government of Egypt Ministry of Health personnel, Suez Canal University (SCU) faculty/students, and others. The SCU Faculty of Medicine (FOM) has made remarkable progress toward project objectives.  The first 3 years of a unique curriculum emphasizing primary health care has been developed; the second, mainly clinical, 3 years have been designed.  A highly motivated staff of 152 faculty (mostly junior members) and 26 physicians in residence have been recruited with offers of subsidized housing, a chance to take part in Egypt's first group practice, research opportunities, and short and long-term training (25 have thus far been trained, including 5 in long-term U.S. programs).  Three undergraduate classes, 195 students, have begun medical training; 45 physicians have entered the Master's general practice (GP) program (the first 14 graduated in 3/83). FOM building renovations were completed in 1981.  Microbiology, pathology, and anatomy labs have been set up and a hematology lab will open soon.  A medical library, maintenance department, and audiovisual center are being developed; however, the former has been unable to recruit a librarian and the latter two, although equipped and staffed, have inadequate management. The project is already having a positive impact on community health services.  FOM students work 2 days a week at 12 urban/rural MOH health centers (4 of which have been renovated with teaching annexes) in Ismailia, Port Said, and the Suez Governorates. Also, 2 GP Master's graduates have become health center directors and others are awaiting assignment. However, the FOM has been hampered by inefficient internal management (e.g., overly centralized authority; lack of commitment by some faculty; and inadequate support staff). Key recommendations are to strengthen FOM administrative and financial capabilities and the clinical program and to expand community health services delivery.","Attached to PD-AAN-920","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Medical schools|Integrated health care|Institution building|Physicians|Physician education|Primary health care|Beneficiary interviews","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAN920A.pdf","4,166 KB","008539 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to promote development research by Egyptian universities.  Mid-term special evaluation covers the period 9/80-3/83 and is based on site visits and interviews with project personnel and potential users of project research. Although an unrealistic time-frame has put it 1.5 years behind schedule, the project is on track, and criticisms within USAID/E and the local press are largely unfounded.  The Supreme Council of Universities (SCU) has established the Foreign Relations Coordination Unit (FRCU) as an agency to review and provide grant funding for research proposals made by Egyptian universities, all 11 of which are participating in the project.  The FRCU, which has a good potential for institutionalization, has determined priority research areas and to date its committees have very carefully reviewed 700 proposals and approved 87 for funding. Efforts are being made to avoid reduplication of research and to move from mini- to maxilinkage research proposals, i.e., from very specific to multidisciplinary research.  Problems have included uneven information dissemination to the universities; undue stress on a few research areas (agriculture and engineering); and FRCU reluctance to reject proposals outright. Perhaps the project's most problematic aspect is the FRCU's interpretation of capacity building as rewarding universities merely for participating, e.g., by approving poor proposals, (contrary to FRCU's usual procedure).  Another problem is that A.I.D.'s automatic inclusion of a TA contractor in the project seems patronizing and unnecessary given the extreme competence of FRCU management.  Because the joint U.S.-Egyptian research envisioned in the project design has proven financially infeasible, U.S. university personnel have played consultant roles, to the satisfaction of their Egyptian counterparts. The most important impact of the project - which has already taught that institutions are not built overnight and that A.I.D. should not seek outside help to implement its own regulations - has been to remove the marginality previously associated with development research in Egypt.

Special evaluation covers the period 9/82-5/83 (a 6/83 memorandum updates A.I.D. action) and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with ONAREP, World Bank, A.I.D., and Bechtel (contractor) personnel. Although the the Bechtel team (4 technical experts and a project/training coordinator) has been in Morocco only 5 months and has been hampered by language, cultural, management, and personality differences, the project has been properly designed, counterpart acceptance has been positive, and some progress has been achieved.  The Bechtel team has:  produced a preliminary design for the 123 km Toukimt/Asmar gas pipline; improved management by making one ONAREP employee responsible for exploration in each geologic basin (a typical petroleum company management scheme); improved drilling speed and the field communication system with a notable cost reduction; introduced periodic, well-by-well, cost accounting procedures; begun planning an international program to promote exploration investment in 5 Moroccan geologic basins; and obtained authority to monitor major ONAREP contracts.  Although some on-the-job training has been provided to ONAREP staff and plans made for seminars and management courses, no formalized training has yet been conducted due in part to the language problem. The project has been hampered by:  a critical shortage of trained, experienced GOM management, planning, technical, and drilling personnel; GOM failure, given ONAREP inexperience, to use contract drilling, leading to excessive and costly drilling times; overly-centralized and bureaucratic (less efficient) management by ONAREP; and an overextended Bechtel staff. Key recommendations include to:  add an additional senior exploration geologist and a management planning advisor to the TA staff and eliminate the technical coordinator; establish a joint venture drilling company with equal ownership by ONAREP and a private contract drilling firm; and conduct formal training courses even if an interpreter must be used.","Attached to PD-AAN-949","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Energy exploration|Energy resource development|Conventional energy resources|Oil drilling|Natural gas|Institution building","Morocco","","","","","000184 - USAID.

"Evaluates project (revised 1981,1982) to improve the energy planning, analysis, and policy development capability of the Government of Morocco Ministry of Energy and Mines (GOM/MEM). Special evaluation covers the period 12/80-4/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with USAID/M, GOM, and contractor personnel. Subsequent memoranda update action. Despite a shortfall in meeting overly ambitious project targets, a good start has been made. The project has provided MEM with an Apple II Plus computer and developed an energy investment (EnVest) decisionmaking model and an associated data base. EnVest I ranks energy investment projects by their internal rate of return taking into account energy production, capital costs, and construction time. EnVest II, a simulation energy supply and demand model, calculates financial/energy variables for a given project over 20 years by 5-year increments. EnVest has not yet been used in policy making; however, several EnVest-based studies are underway. Contractor performance has been excellent and computer documentation, although incomplete, is well-written and understandable. GOM project interest/involvement has increased over the past year; a new MEM section, the cellule de planification, has been proposed as the permanent home for EnVest. Also, a 4/83 EnVest demonstration held, at MEM's urging, for 80 GOM officials was generally well-received, although some felt the model was inadequately explained. The project has failed to collect energy production data or to develop national scenarios as originally planned; however, the cellule, EnVest, and the data base should enable data collection. EnVest cannot analyze technical feasibility or social and environmental impact; nor does it include price effects or adequately analyze demand (the latter two seriously limit its use in policy making). Also, due to budgetary constraints, an inordinate amount of time has been spent creating programs when relatively inexpensive ready-made software is available. Key recommendations are to: emphasize policy analysis (vs. computer programming); upgrade computer documentation; develop an EnVest pricing model; and improve EnVest demand analysis.","Attached to PD-AAN-950","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Computers|Computer software|Simulations|Energy planning|Energy policy|Databases|Policy making","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAN950A.pdf","2,382 KB","","","000184 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to conduct repetitive sample surveys of contraceptive attitudes and practices in 25-30 LDC's. Special evaluation covers the period 9/79-7/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with Westinghouse Health Systems (WHS) contractor personnel and relevant experts. Funding uncertainties and political considerations in country selection (which led to the project's concentration in small Caribbean nations) have put the project behind schedule, despite WHS's impressive effort in recruiting and helping sub-contractors and in enlisting the participation of interested countries. By the project's 9/84 expiration, 32 of 60 planned surveys (24 first-round and 6 second-round) will likely be completed in 30 LDC's. Emphasis has been placed on first round rather than repetitive surveys; first and second round surveys have been conducted in only three countries. To date, eight country reports have been completed; an extension may be needed to complete the rest. Regarding survey documentation targets, four adaptable core documents - the core questionnaire, interviewer's and supervisor's manuals, and the coding/editing manual - have been widely published, and two supplemental modules - for male prevalence (in Barbados) and for abortion (in Nicaragua) - were added. Refinement and standardization could make the documentation more useful. Field operations have generally gone well and been sufficiently monitored to ensure a scientific sample, although careful monitoring of field operations is urged. A strong point has been overseas TA and training in data processing provided by WHS. Regional seminars and country workshops have proven effective means of disseminating project results, but there is a need to expand mailing operations and develop an ongoing feedback mechanism. The contract's objectives of producing numerous baseline prevalence estimates notably hindered efforts to provide the data analysis sought by host country researchers. Key recommendations for a follow-on project are to broaden country representation, further analyze results, stress the improvement of LDC survey capabilities, and ensure sampling accuracy.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","7/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning surveys|KAP surveys|Contraceptive acceptor characteristics","Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN952.pdf","2,647 KB","001318 - American Public Health Association.

"A comparative analysis of the findings of impact evaluations of P.L. 480 Title I programs in Bangladesh, Egypt, Jamaica, Peru, and Sri Lanka is presented. Initial sections describe changes in U.S. agriculture and policies since Title I's inception in 1954, and the resulting effect on P.L. 480 programming.  Next discussed are the various host country contexts and their evolution, including two cases (Egypt and Peru) where Title I aid was interrupted.  A review of socioeconomic development in the five countries highlights differing possibilities for program impact. Assessment of Title I's macroeconomic impact shows that the impact on balance of payments support, while positive in each case, was more apparent in countries with greater economic constraints (Bangladesh, Jamaica) and that the program tended to directly benefit the more affluent in Jamaica and Peru.  Evaluation of microeconomic and development impacts reveals a production disincentive effect since the early 1960's for one or more food crops, although these disincentives may be offset by improvements in food import policy.  The impact on nutritional status and dietary patterns was found to vary:  wheat consumption increased in Egypt and Sri Lanka, while the program helped place a floor on caloric intake in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.  A final section notes that Title I has promoted U.S. foreign policy aims but has not strengthened U.S. agricultural markets or (except in Bangladesh) policy dialogue. It is concluded that:  either Title I's multiyear option or a modified Title III would provide significant programmatic and policy improvements; self-help agreements are too vague and should be replaced by a rolling 5-year planning exercise, as in Peru; improved coordination between food and nonfood donors, especially the International Monetary Fund, can increase the likelihood of desired policy changes and minimize host country logistical problems.  Further data needs are to measure more precisely the long- and short-run disincentive effects of P.L. 480 on large and marginal programs and to better document the nutrition and dietary pattern impacts of food aid, especially Title I.  The impact evaluations demonstrate the need to monitor A.I.D. programs continuously.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace|Economic aspects|Economic development|Food aid programs|Diet|Development strategies","Bangladesh|Egypt|Jamaica|Peru|Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL030.pdf","1,914 KB","","","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help Morocco's Ministry of Housing and Regional Development (MHAT) to upgrade squatter housing in the Ben M'Sik bidonville of Casablanca.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/79-1/83; no methodology is noted. Just when the project was beginning to make progress, MHAT's new Minister developed a plan (in 1/82) which called for relocating the entire Ben M'Sik population (some 80,000 persons) 3 km away at a cost three times greater than the original project budget. A.I.D. has informed MHAT that it cannot support the relocation approach, which it sees as a setback for the goal of achieving a more rational housing policy in Morocco, and has instructed project advisors to focus their efforts on the recently approved HG-002; in this, MHAT has concurred, assuring A.I.D. that it intends to focus on upgrading, except in the Greater Casablanca area. Prior to this, good progress had been made in responding to the 5/81 PES, which had noted that the first 1-2 years of the project had been a time of learning (most project staff were new university graduates), with few accomplishments.  Two pedestrian overpasses were constructed and work was begun on plans to upgrade a pilot zone of 800-900 households.  A site had been chosen for housing 300 families which would be displaced by infrastructure improvements and road, drainage, and sewer designs for the zone completed; 8 contracts were ready to be let. In addition, seminars had been held for 12 community development workers, a tour of an HG upgrading project in Tunis conducted, and monthly accounting and financial reporting systems developed. Overall, the project staff's capacity to design and implement shelter programs had substantially improved. Lessons learned are:  inexperienced staff working on complex projects need a learning period; shelter projects in Morocco should be uncomplicated, with clear understanding among all parties of the roles and responsibilities of each; A.I.D. training for Moroccan housing officials - who are not yet committed to cost recovery, affordability, and reduced subsidies - is crucial; consideration should be given to fielding a resident advisor from the outset in future HG's; and A.I.D. and the World Bank should cooperate in efforts to rationalize housing policy in Morocco.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Housing investment guaranty|Housing planning|Housing policy|Urban areas|Slum areas|Squatters|Building renovation|Ministers","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN968.pdf","1,052 KB","003575 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop an applied dryland agricultural research program in Morocco.  Special evaluation covers the period 6/78-5/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with A.I.D., Government of Morocco (GOM), contractor, and other-donor personnel. Despite a slow start due to delays in the arrival of TA staff, in the selection of participants for U.S. training, and in the construction of the National Agronomic Research Institute's Aridoculture Center (AC) (funded by the GOM), the project has made substantial progress.  All but 3 of 25 participant trainees (15 Doctoral and 10 Master's candidates) are either studying in the U.S. or are receiving language training in Morocco before departure.  Despite an unbroken 3-year drought which limited yield data, agronomic field experiments conducted (1981-82, 1982-83) at three satellite stations and farms throughout the region showed the potential for moisture storage in deeper soils and the value of certain production methods:  e.g., the proper timing of herbicides for weed control; wider row spacing using grain drills at lower seeding rates; and the proper use of fertilizers.  Also, work on developing new cereal varieties (3 barley, 2 durum and 1 bread wheat) is progressing. Socioeconomic studies implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture in Haute Chaouia have included:  Master's theses on soil classification, food consumption, farm size, etc.; and a 51-farm sample survey. Although AC constructon at Settat is nearing completion, staff housing is inadequate and the suitability of the site for long-term agricultural research is doubtful (i.e., too small; soil not uniform). Other problems include:  inadequate GOM funding resulting in limited staffing; an overly ambitious project design in terms of time and resources; equipment more suitable for farming than research; and inadequate transportation and GOM per diem for travel. Key recommendations are to increase funding for TA, participant training, commodity procurement, and socioeconomic research and and to extend the life of project.","Attached to PD-AAN-972","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Dry farming|On farm research|Research centers|Research facilities|Applied research|Agronomy|Participants|Institution building|Arid zone","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAN972A.pdf","1,705 KB","008579 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to stabilize soils and forestall landslides along the Far Western Hills Road in Nepal.  Engineering evaluation covers the period 1979-1982 and was conducted with reference to previous reviews by Kojan (1978) and Mathur (1979). Quality construction has been conducted along the road due to both the expertise of Department of Roads (DR) staff and Nepali contractors and their sensitivity to local conditions.  The engineering works suggested by Kojan and Mathur have been built as designed and have performed to or beyond requirements in all cases.  While there is no surviving record of any systematic monitoring of pilot slope stabilization works, the project's overall success suggests any results would have been positive. Surveys were conducted to evaluate alternative construction locations suggested by Kojan, but it was concluded that the cost was not likely to be justified and none of the relocations were built; events seem to support this decision.  Kojan and Mathur were unrealistic in specifying items such as rock bolts, plastic membranes, horizontally drilled drains, and sophisticated blasting techniques which are not readily available in Nepal. Logistics and procurement have been deficient as regards equipment. The list of equipment on inventory includes 106 pieces of various kinds built by at least 30 different makers in six nations.  Of these, only 32 are in working order; 50 are awaiting repair parts, 23 are beyond repair, and one is idle for lack of work.  Most pieces are more than 10 years old, cannabalized, and at the end of their economical service life. While there is a substantial supply of parts and these appear to be well-organized and catalogued, 33% of the parts are for equipment no longer located at the main storage yard in Godavari. Most serious, there is no orderly system for planning equipment purchases or for paying for them other than by line item in the current budget.  Given the time needed for delivery of a major item, the lack of budget carryover beyond the end of the fiscal year is a major handicap. Overall, the DR has intelligently administered the project.  The amount of plan preparation and review done is exceptional. However, the DR has been reluctant to acquire unfamiliar technology, even that which is not excessively expensive and which has a very high probable benefit. Also the DR still lacks a maintenance ethic; much improvement is needed in this area (including changes in government policies) if the road is to be a useful, all-weather facility.  Maintenance is now being done to an extent, particularly during the monsoon season, but not as regularly and systematically as should be.

"Evaluates project to stabilize the soil and forestal landslides along the Far Western Hills Road in Nepal.  The evaluation, based on field-checks, focuses on the soils, geology, and landscape features (e.g., slope, vegetation) of road segments between Godavari and Dadeldhura. Four zones, each having reasonable landscape homogeneity, were delineated.  Soils were evaluated for agronomic purposes according to the latest soil taxonomy (although they have not been correlated).  Each zone is discussed with regard to soil type, incidence of landslides, and naturally occuring vegetation. Some 67,000 plants are reported by one nurseryman to have been planted to guard against landslides and help to stabilize the soil, although it was impossible to verify this figure.  Of the 15 species of plants attempted, only four show success.  Two local species (Utis and Ritha) show the greatest vigor, followed by Acacia deabata and kalki phul.  Most of the plants that failed did so because they were out of their altitude range (e.g., one species which occurs naturally in damp forest soils was planted on dry south-facing slopes).  No grass seedings had been attempted.  Natural, vigorous revegetation of Chhir pine on steep, bare slopes was evident on many cut and fill slopes.  Most Utis plantings on steep slopes, on the other hand, had been destroyed by landslides.  Utis plantings were most successful on top of gabion structures; however, as Utis reaches maturity its roots will destroy the structures.  All Utis trees growing on these structures should be girdled or cut off.

"Evaluates socioeconomic impact of the Far Western Hills Road in Nepal.  Evaluation covers the period 1979-11/83 and is based on data from government offices and interviews with beneficiaries. The road has clearly become important to the social and economic development of the hill area which it serves; follow-on construction of feeder roads to adjacent remote areas (already underway, financed by the Asian Development Bank) will further affect development.  Specifically, (1) prices of essential commodities imported by the hill population have dropped, and those received for exports have increased; (2) the amount of land devoted to foodgrain production has risen impressively, due in part to agricultural inputs provided by the Mahakali Integrated Rural Development Project (even so, agricultural productivity in general has suffered due to migration from the hills and depletion of flatland areas); (3) school enrollment (especially of boys) has increased (apparently attributable to higher expectations, as transportation costs remains high); (4) more people are using public and private health facilities, and medicines are more readily available at better prices (attitudes about family planning have not changed substantially, however); and (7) a pilot financial procedure has contributed positively to efficient operation of the project. However, industrial growth has been negligible, and, while road construction has offered off-season employment, the road has also displaced some traditional porterage laborers.  There has been an excessive lag between road completion and the development of other job opportunities in the Western Hills. The central problem is to ensure that effective institutional and management structures accompany the development processes brought about by the road.  Lack of an efficient marketing system, for example, has hindered expansion of agriculture into high value crops, especially in the far western area.  The need to keep the road operational year-round to protect consumers from shortages, sustain rural income, and permit the orderly operation of industrial enterprises is of paramount importance. The project shows the importance of an interdisciplinary, multisectoral approach when planning major interventions of this type. In this regard, there has been an overemphasis on technical solutions at the expense of social and institutional factors. Other government agencies should have been involved from the initial planning stages in order to address such issues as population migration, increased expectations among the rural poor, and the need for additional job opportunities and environmental protection measures.

"Evaluates project to increase fish production in the Dominican Republic. Special evaluation covers the period through 12/82; no methodology is noted. Considerable progress has been made during the project's first year. An additional 37 ponds (used for demonstrations, training, and fingerling production) were constructed, economic research (on farmer characteristics and fish production costs) is underway, and carp fingerling availability has improved (although there are still problems in having sufficient quality tilapia fingerlings). Cooperation among agencies taking part in aquaculture activities has also improved. Servicio Social De Iglesiais Dominicanas (SSID), the project implementor, has shared staff and facilities with the Fundacion para el Desarrollo de Comunidad (FUDECO), has cooperated with the Instituto Dominicano de Tecnologia (INDOTEC) in production of tilapia hybrids, and has established linkages with the state aquaculture department. In the area of training, the project coordinator studied chinese carp reproduction for a month in Panama, and a field agent is scheduled for a 16-week U.S. aquaculture class in 1983. Nonetheless, fish production continues to be low, for pond management practices are still not well defined (a result, in part, of the emphasis on fish pond contruction); fingerling availability (while better) is still sporadic; and, most importantly, not enough nutrients are being added to the ponds (this latter due to farmers' lack of ready cash and their failure to truly appreciate the importance of adding nutrients). A rotary fund planned for the second part of the project should increase the availability of feed and fertilizer. During the next year, less emphasis should be given to pond construction and much more emphasis to investigating and documenting fish management procedures and strengthening extension via frequent farm visits and demonstrations. Other rcommendations are, inter alia, to provide TA to farmers interested in commercial production and to strengthen project reporting.","Attached to PD-AAN-991","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Inland fisheries|Fish culture|Limited data plus","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAN991A.pdf","645 KB","000286 - Auburn University.

"Evaluates Phase II of project in Bangladesh to develop a locally manufactured Stirling engine fueled by rice husks to be used for rice milling.  Interim evaluation covers the period through 12/83 and was prepared by representatives of A.I.D., The Asia Foundation (TAF - the grantee), and Sunpower, Inc. (contractor). The project has accomplished much, but its ultimate success is not assured.  A locally made Stirling power unit was operated for the first time in 11/83.  With the exception of the hot end, each component was made in Bangladesh based on models which had been adapted to local needs at the design and/or testing stage; a special brazing furnace has been designed so that hot ends can be manufactured locally.  Operation of the engine is well within the skills available in rural Bangladesh (a similar, foreign-made engine has been in operation since Phase I). The engine's costs are higher than expected, as adaptation to local conditions made it necessary to use cast iron (which is sold by weight in Bangladesh) rather than aluminum components. However, following further design improvements and changes in the manufacturing process, both weight and cost should be reduced. The final selling price is projected to be about $768, close to the target of 150% of the cost of a comparable diesel engine. Three rice hulling systems (disc, rubber roll, and centrifugal) have been evaluated for use with the engine; the centrifugal method has been chosen for testing during Phase I and manufacturers have been identified. Due to the project's highly technical nature, manufacture will initially be limited to a few firms and there is risk that the transfer of the technology will not be as widespread as possible. Experience from other environments shows that every effort must be made to institutionalize the technology (including capacities for engine maintenance and repair) throughout the country.  The ultimate utility of project efforts is further imperiled by changes in energy use in Bangladesh, where, in recent years, the growing population has been forced to use even rice husks as household fuel. Much of the project's success in overcoming technical problems is attributable to the quality of the TA and to the perserverance and innovativeness of TAF. It is recommended that:  (1) Phase III activities, including the testing of engine designs to decrease weight and cost factors, be authorized and performance levels for commercially available units be set and tested for appropriateness; and (2) USAID/B and TAF discuss a follow-on project to address technology transfer and the establishment of equipment maintenance and repair facilities.

Ex post impact evaluation is based mainly on questionnaire surveys of villagers and village health workers and interviews with government and other agency personnel. The project suffered from early administrative problems (e.g., delays in recruiting project staff), but most of all from the lack of a clear implementation plan and of long-term planning. Three years were spent in community dialogues and in collecting baseline data and no real action was taken until the extension year (9/82-8/83).  Nonetheless, the project has had a visible impact on the area and is widely praised by villagers. Although community health committees were never active due to a lack of follow-up to their training, the training of community health leaders (CHL's), the project's main change agents, was soundly conceived and effective, in large measure thanks to trainers from local institutions such as Jumla Hospital and Karnali Technical School.  Interest in CHL training was widespread, and practitioners knowledgeable and highly respected by villagers; traditional birth attendants (Sudenis) who were trained as CHL's have proven particularly effective.  By 8/83, 452 CHL's (over 100% of target) and 47 Sudenis (no target) will have been trained; only 146 of the CHL's were women, however, and not 216 as planned, and a large number of women never completed their training, for reasons that are not wholly clear.  CHL demonstration projects (e.g., latrine construction, for which, however, most did not receive the pay promised them) were very effective in promoting changes in the villages and in promoting the idea that preventative health measures were possible and necessary. Of the construction projects, the government guest house in Jumla is complete.  The 5 village water systems, the Bazar drainage system, the health post at Depalgaun, and community and school latrine programs are in varying stages of progress.  The question of long-term maintenance for any project has yet to be addressed. Extension of the project, which is just beginning to make its true presence felt, is strongly urged.  Specific recommendations are included.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Community participation|Primary health care|Preventive health care|Community health care|Paramedical education|Community health workers|Sanitation education|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method|Limited data plus","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP008.pdf","2,002 KB","003591 - New ERA|003592 - Nepal Red Cross Society","","008583 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to construct suspension bridges in rural Nepal. External final evaluation covers the period 8/79-12/83 and is based on document review, indepth interviews with key local informants, and visits to 5 bridge sites. In general, project-constructed bridges -  22 have been constructed and another 19 should be completed by 1/84 - have enhanced the mobility of local populations, although bridges constructed on minor trails or over small rivers have had little impact. Negative impacts were noted at one site, where traditional ferrymen were displaced and forest exploitation increased.  Although the Government of Nepal's (GON) Suspension Bridge Department (SBD) does have an appropriate system for screening requests for bridge construction, it lacks reliable maps and surveying guidelines, and site selection is mostly based on personal judgment and political pressure.  USAID/N's attempt to introduce objective site selection and ranking criteria failed due to SBD's lack of commitment and USAID/N's own laxity.  Also, USAID/N's proposed selection system did not take national priorities sufficiently into consideration. The SBD's technical capabilities have improved significantly - a result of staff additions and of in-country training by the Swiss Association for Technical Assistance (project-funded offshore training was less successful) - and the SBD should require very little TA in future projects.  Nonetheless, deficiencies remain in SBD organization, management, and planning - most especially in fiscal management and accounting, although some progress has been made in these areas due to hiring of new accountants.  A revolving fund system is suggested for future projects:  a reimbursement system is not practical because the SBD lacks access to working capital and an advance system is not possible given SBD's fiscal ineptitude.  Also, the SBD should implement a preventive maintenance program immediately.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Bridge construction|Suspension bridges|Socioeconomic status|Beneficiary interviews","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP009.pdf","13,289 KB","003594 - East Consult, Ltd.","","008588 - USAID.

"Evaluates P.L. 480 Title II program in Cape Verde.  Special evaluation covers the period 1/82-7/83 asnd is based on site visits and interviews with the Government of Cape Verde (GOCV), World Health Organization, and World Food Program officials. P.L. 480 commodities have been delivered in a timely manner and have helped to maintain the nutritional status of Cape Verde's populace. Sale of the commodities generates some $2 million a year in local currency, far more than the GOCV has been able to expend on the planned soil and water conservation subprojects (SP's).  While the completed SP's (four planned SP's have not yet been initiated) are well designed, well built, and of low cost, only one has met its expenditure and employment targets.  SP shortfalls are due to a variety of factors, including insufficient staff to plan and manage these activities, shortages of equipment and materials, poor coordination among GOUV agencies, and a lack of direction from A.I.D.; also, some of the targets are apparently too ambitious. Accounting procedures and controls for local currency proceeds are adequate; even though P.L. 480 proceeds are commingled with proceeds from the sales of other-donor commodities, separate subaccounts are maintained. Some commodities are stored in the open with no protection from pests or climatic effects and all warehouses visited were infested with moths; special attention must be given to the selection of appropriate pesticides. Detailed recommendations address problem areas.","Evaluation period: Jan 1982-1983|v. 2: PL-480 Title II section 206 evaluation : volume II (PD-AAP-295)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title II|Soil conservation|Water conservation|Local currency","Cape Verde","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP010.pdf","1,613 KB","008525 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the Nepal Disabled and Blind Association (NDBA) transform the Kagendra New Life Center (KNLC) from a custodial to a rehabilitative center.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/80-8/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with NDBA, KNLC, International Human Assistance Program (IHAP), and USAID/N staff and with KNLC students and former students. Although good progress is being made in upgrading the KLNC, the project has made little headway in strengthening NDBA's administrative capabilities, due to NDBA's failure to appoint a strong chief administrative officer early on and its offhand and perfunctory approach to project administration.  IHAP's TA has generally been very effective, but recent personnel changes initiated by IHAP's home office have led to strain between IHAP and NDBA (in contrast to the good will that existed earlier). The project has contributed significantly to KNLC's general education program (particularly in the areas of buildings, equipment procurement, staff expansion, curriculum development, and the inculcation of long- and short-term planning ethos) and it has strengthened vocational training by providing more space, new equipment, and expanded staffing. However, a sound vocational training program with built-in monitoring has yet to be established, further policy development is needed with regard to both general and vocational training, and problems of student motivation persist. Establishment of a KNLC general health care program (including an infirmary with round-the-clock professional care) has been successful, and Nepalese funding of the program's operating costs institutionalized; areas of weakness include preventive care and psychological counseling. Also, the medical rehabilitation program has been upgraded with the addition of a prosthetic/orthotic production unit, a physiotherapy unit, and staff training; although production of orthopedic devices has been low, the program shows promise and is planning to add surgical facilities and expand its clientele to include nonresidents. Considerable progress has also been made in establishing a social rehabilitation unit.  All KNLC physical plant inputs have been completed; proper maintenance and effective use need to be ensured.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Handicapped persons|Vocational training|Training centers|Health facilities|Institution building|Beneficiary interviews","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP013.pdf","23,178 KB","003590 - Development Communication and Research Consultancy Group","","000041 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen commercial delivery systems for production of goods/services in Tanzania.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/80-9/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with Tanzania Rural Development Bank (TRDB) and USAID/T staff and with project beneficiaries. A series of delays have hampered the project: the TRDB's computer system is two and a half years behind schedule.  Also, as a result of the Tanzanian default on a scheduled repayment of earlier development loans, A.I.D. was required to halt further loans.  Manufacturing and village food processing are only slightly behind schedule and individual units are proving more socially and economically beneficial than estimated.  If readjustments are made for start-up delays of one to two and a half years, TRDB progress is nearly on schedule. Detailed description, planning, and scheduling for individual outputs should be emphasized.  Because Phase II has been eliminated, TRDB needs to make sound proposals to international donors for financing future programs. Specific recommendations respecting TRDB operations include: to prepare a policy and procedures manual; to upgrade economic research/planning capacity to prepare proposals for international donor financing; to reconcile existing loan accounts; to transfer accounts and records transferred to a new computer and loans in critical default to a collection account; to improve management; to prepare a plan for undertaking the newly assigned cooperative banking function; to create an internal audit and credit review system; to review and revise record keeping guidance for head, regional and district offices; to prepare a training plan to meet the institutional needs for undertaking a large array of improved procedures and large volume of businesses; to develop/implement plans for transfer of the input distribution functions and for disposal of inventory; and to close specialized facilities/accounts.","Evaluation period: 14 Sep-5 Oct 1983","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Development banks|Food processing|Development finance|Beneficiary interviews","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP023.pdf","3,427 KB","003002 - Ronco Consulting Corp.","","008612 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help Ecuador's National Campesino Training Institute (INCCA) implement a National Rural Training System (SNCR) to provide informal education to campesinos.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/80-3/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with INCCA staff and officials in sectors related to INCCA. Implementation has been hindered by delays in project initiation and equipment arrival, as well as by internal and external organizational difficulties.  Two A.I.D. conditions -  that the nascent INCCA be established within the Ministry of Agriculture (MAG) and that a multi-institutional, multisectoral project advisory body be created - were not fulfilled until 9/81; a third, that guidelines for administering the rural training credit fund in support of training activities be developed prior to fund disbursement, is still unfulfilled.  Four of the 5 project vehicles arrived and MAG printing equipment was installed only shortly prior to evaluation.  Problems have also been caused by the GOE's failure to specify direct support for SNCR in its counterpart contribution to INCCA and by MAG's refusal to pay project per diem and transportation costs.  More serious still have been INCCA's in-house problems, including an untrained, overworked, and underpaid staff; inadequate facilities; and a lack of internal control - until recently, INCCA was dependent on MAG's Division of Peasant Development and INCCA's acting director, with very little power (or job security), was unable to press for SNCR development.  Also, the Integrated Rural Development (IRD) Secretariat exerted a strong and unwelcome influence over INCCA activities.  As a result of its weak development, INCCA has been unable to develop productive relationships with public and private institutions and so to implement the SNCR. Nonetheless, the appointment of a new director, increasing INCCA autonomy, the resolution of some personnel problems, the arrival of equipment, and the contribution being made to IRD by INCCA field personnel indicate that significant progress is probable. Major recommendations are to reassert and clarify the project's institutional relationships; reprogram INCCA activities and expenses (with a budget increase from MAG); and extend the project 18 months.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","518-1054-C-00-30-36-0","","3/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Nonformal education|Peasants|Institution building|Government departments","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP036.pdf","1,744 KB","","","008538 - USAID.

"Evaluates project implemented by Mississippi State University's (MSU's) Seed Technology Laboratory (STL) to provide LDC's with TA on seed production.  Special evaluation covers the period 4/79-7/83 and is based on document review and interviews with MSU staff. The cooperative agreement between A.I.D. and MSU has been highly successful.  STL, with a professional staff of eight who devote 30-35% of their time to the A.I.D. project, has provided 41 person-months of excellent TA, helping 54 LDC's to develop comprehensive seed programs and/or solve specific seed problems. As an information resource for LDC's, STL has provided general publications (over 200), scientific reprints, personal correspondence, and consultations (with 81 international visitors). MSU has trained 272 LDC participants through:  degree (B.S., M.S., and Ph.D.) and nondegree (4-8 weeks) campus programs; and short overseas courses in, inter alia, seed technology (Colombia, Upper Volta), seed conditioning (Kenya, Colombia), and seed pathology (Thailand).  MSU staff have delivered an average of 237-460 person-days of instruction annually in LDC's and have helped 10 LDC's to develop training programs. STL has also conducted a significant amount of applied research, into specific LDC seed problems, including:  developing a heater fan to dry cowpea seeds in Guyana and a solar seed dryer for Nepal; and investigating new forage grasses for South and Central America and the use of defoliants and desiccants to speed cowpea production in Guyana. MSU has helped 15 African, Asian, and Central and South American LDC's to develop applied seed research efforts. The project has been very cost-effective, with MSU funding the excellent STL facilities and other costs, and with STL providing some LDC assistance free of charge to the grant and cooperating freely with other assistance programs.  Also, the close proximity to MSU of 5 state seed units enhances STL's technical/training capacity. Key recommendations are to continue the project at MSU and the cooperative funding arrangement.","Attached to PD-AAP-034","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSAN-CA-0148","","7/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Varietal research|Seed testing|Seed production|Seeds|Foundation seed|Laboratories","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP034A.pdf","1,212 KB","","","000180 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the capabilities of local Philippine governments in property tax assessment, collection, and administration. Special evaluation covers the period to 2/83 and is based on document review, interviews with project and concerned officials, and visits to 4 regional, 10 provincial, and 17 municipal tax offices. The project has made significant gains.  At least 150 local government units (LGU's) have completed tax mapping, appraisal/assessment, and records conversion; 51 of these had only begun technical implementation after 1/82 (at which time the Ministry of Finance - MOF - took over implementation responsibility from the Ministry of Local Government and Community Development - MLGCD).  At another 183 LGU's, implementation of a tax system was in various stages of completion.  Overall completion is estimated to be about 70%.  A central project management office has been formally established in the MOF and regional MOF directors have been designated Regional Project Managers.  The central office's monitoring and evaluation unit is already implementing a project-prepared monitoring and evaluation manual.  In addition, training has been provided to 241 tax administrators, assessors, and treasurers, and other technical personnel (from various regions, provinces, and cities, as well as from the central office) through courses and seminars in-country and at the University of Southern California. Among the major constraints on the project has been a failure to follow certain budgetary requirements, which turned out to be a major obstacle to providing LGU's with timely funds and commodity supports. Also, the new MOF project management team was not allotted a learning period, and, as a result, lacked detailed plans and schedules and did not adequately control project performance. A key recommendation is that the MLGCD continue to actively participate in the project, particularly in tax collections. Other recommendations are made regarding project organization, personnel, planning, finance, logistics, and technical procedures; training; and a possible extension period. Field survey reports on the LGU's visited are appended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Real property taxes|Tax collection|Tax assessments|Government departments|Local level","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP031.pdf","2,267 KB","007320 - SGV & Co.","","008592 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to adapt rainfed agricultural technologies to the Philippines' Eastern Visayas region.  Special evaluation covers the period 1981-11/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel and farmer-cooperators. Despite problems, the project has made commendable progress, generating strong interest among staff and cooperating farmers. Its administrative structure is in place and its technical staff competent. Initiation of research was hampered by drought and by funding delays, but cropping trials are now underway at six sites representing the major agroclimatic zones of the region.  Some 12 farmer-cooperators are participating at each site. Following are the major problem areas.  There are too many sites, and not all are representative of the farms most needing benefits.  Some of the cropping changes being tested are too sweeping, well beyond the means of the farmers in the area; only one or two major modifications should be introduced at the same time.  Also, some field trials have deviated from the original plan, e.g., by omitting certain essential crops such as abaca; changes in the research plan have not been documented.  The rationale behind the field trials is not always clear to farmer-cooperators and field staff, nor do staff fully comprehend the dynamics of the existing farming system, particularly the role of livestock.  The level of farmer-cooperators' involvement in research activiites varies greatly by site. Also, proposals for the back-up research program, which is still being finalized, are not always relevant to ongoing field trials. Field staff have not made any suggestions for back-up research and have never been consulted on selection of short-term consultants.  Communication among project entities, while generally adequate, can certainly be improved.  There has been no real effort to involve other farmers and community organizations in the project, and there are no formal, and few informal, linkages with other agencies.  Most serious, little thought has been given to integrating project functions into existing Ministry of Agriculture programs when the project ends. Recommendations address these problems, changes in staffing pattern and salaries, and increased TA and training by Cornell University.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Farming systems research|On farm research|Research management|Dry farming|Farming systems|Beneficiary interviews","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP045.pdf","13,413 KB","","","008592 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop a Vehicle Maintenance Training Center to upgrade the skills of Egyptian bus and truck repairmen. Special evaluation covers the period 8/81-8/83 and is based on document review, indepth interviews, and a site visit. The project is seriously off target and all three parties - the General Syndicate of Land Transport (GSLT), RCA (the contractor), and USAID/E - are deeply disappointed.  No workers have been trained (200 were targeted for this date); only 9 of 22 instructors for the Center have received U.S. training; only 6 of 15 courses have been completed; and customs problems have allowed only two of eight shops to be completely equipped. The GSLT, which even now does not seem to understand the contract, has not provided a full-time Center director as counterpart to the RCA Chief of Party (COP) and has in effect abandoned responsibility for the project.  The GSLT has seriously hurt implementation by rejecting RCA's original training curricula (prepared using a methodology agreed to in the contract) and by failing to:  complete Center construction before RCA's arrival; provide incentives adequate to attract and maintain instructors; and involve bus and truck company management in course development. In its turn, RCA's record regarding procurement (e.g., sending 110V instead of 220V equipment), fellowship training, and curriculum development has hardly been exemplary.  Although RCA was forced to abandon the methodology contracted for, it is now using off-the-shelf U.S. materials which seem to be above the reading level of the potential trainees and require 30-40% revision.  U.S. training of Center instructors by RCA has had meager results due to trainees's lack of comprehension of English.  With some direction, RCA's performance could have been much better. Although the USAID/E project officer was to spend 40% of his time on this project and despite early warning signals, little was done to pressure the GSLT into action; USAID/E's role seems to have been dominated by expediency and by sensitivity to the GSLT. The only strong push for action came from the first COP - who was dismissed by the GSLT. This teaches the need for USAID to fill management gaps left created host agencies.","Attached to PD-AAN-854","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Vehicle repair|Public transportation|Vocational training|Mechanical technology|Educational facilities|Educational materials|Local languages","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAN854A.pdf","1,765 KB","","","008539 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to support the development of the Lesotho Distance Teaching Centre (LDTC), a nonformal education (NFE) institution.  Third annual evaluation covers the period 12/81-12/82 and is based on interviews with project personnel and site visits. Due to its focus on institutional development (through a new building extension, long- and short-term TA, and salary support for up to ll local staff), the project has equipped the LDTC to make a major impact on education, training, and income generation among rural groups.  For its part, the LDTC, although severely criticizing last year's evaluation, has implemented 30 of its 36 recommendations, a Government of Lesotho (GOL) hiring freeze and other in-country constraints forestalling the others. The LDTC's Service Agency (SA) has made good progress.  During the last year, the SA has:  increased its staff from 2 to 6 (a major need is to hire a woman as a second NFE officer); completed a major study of NFE; undertaken 30 major interventions under its Assistance Fund (eligibility criteria and procedures for which need refinement); and begun replacing printing as a source of income with other activities such as the provision of innovative training - a field in which SA is becoming a leader. In accordance with a long-term staff development plan it has developed for the LDTC, the project is providing a wide range of in-country and overseas training for LDTC staff.  Intensive and ongoing workshops have proven especially worthwhile, although the LDTC should rely more in the future on the SA and encourage only those workshops that directly improve its work.  Master's training should be limited to senior LDTC officials. Due to various factors - including the GOL hiring freeze, growth of the SA, and changes in perceived needs - the LDTC is currently considering a reorganization; recommendations include grouping all writers under a single writing section and addressing the serious inefficiency of the printing section.  As for the SA, the extent of the GOL's budgetary support in the future will depend on the extent to which GOL leaders have been convinced of the project's impact. Major recommendations are to extend the project a year to 4/30/84 and to conduct an evaluation in mid-1983 to determine the need for a further 2-year extension.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Nonformal education|Institution building|Personnel development|Educational materials|Beneficiary count|Limited data plus","Lesotho","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP061.pdf","716 KB","001963 - Lesotho Distance Teaching Centre","","008569 - USAID.

"Evaluates Special Development Activities Fund (SDAF) project in Peru to implement fast-impact socially oriented and income-producing community subprojects (SP's).  Special evaluation covers the period through 8/83 and is based on site visits, questionnaire data, discussions with A.I.D. and implementing personnel, and case studies of 24 representative SP's. Most SP's have been implemented rapidly; it takes 3-4 months from the time an idea is submitted until funds are allocated and then 4-6 months till SP completion.  A total of 681 SP's have been implemented; most, contrary to project intent, been socially oriented (because the need for social improvements is so great and because income-producing SP's are much harder to implement). The social SP's (in education, water/sewage, health, and other areas) have brought significant community improvements and strengthened community ties and faith in established institutions. Community participation has been high, but maintenance of SP improvements remains a problem. Income-producing SP's have been less successful.  Funding (usually $5,000) is generally not adequate, potential beneficiaries lack the resources (e.g., education) needed to contribute to implementation, and the quick-impact timeframe is simply too short. Of 7 SP's studied, 5 have generated no jobs. Moreover, these unsuccessful SP's have no idea what to produce, how to organize themselves, or where to channel sales. Finally, most beneficiaries are unaware that the SP's are funded by the U.S. Government. Key recommendations are to increase the SDAF budget to $500,000 or 0.5% (whichever is greater) of the annual A.I.D. budget and divide funds equally between social and income-generating SP's. Individual income-generating grants should be larger and should be channeled through large institutions wherever possible, with more TA and training provided.  If the SDAF budget is not increased, income-generating SP's should be cancelled, for the social SP's have more impact on more people at less cost.  Grant criteria should ensure that groups with access to funds elsewhere do not receive funds (as has occurred). Appended are reports on each of the 24 SP's studied and the questionnaire instrument.","Companion project evaluation summary: PD-ABB-827","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Development projects|Poor|Income|Social development|Economic development|Beneficiary interviews","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP082.pdf","2,289 KB","008591 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report (8/78-12/83) on a project to reduce critical manpower constraints in Botswana, primarily in the areas of agriculture, health, and education, and to strengthen public sector capabilities to meet the country's development needs. The project successfully reduced the magnitude of Botswana's manpower deficit by providing highly qualified operational experts (OPEX) to the GOB and by conducting training programs tailored to meet GOB development needs.  Despite a 1-year delay in approving an OPEX contractor, OPEX technicians have contributed to a sustained and improved level of organizational efficiency in the GOB departments they served in, both by filling critical GOB personnel gaps and by providing on-the-job training to counterparts.  A total of 60 person-years of long-term and 50 person-months of short-term OPEX assistance (vs. respective targets of 90 and 65) were provided, the shortfall being due in part to a decision to increase participant training levels. Long-term participant training exceeded targets - 172 participants (48 targeted) were trained in the United States or in other African countries.  Another 258 persons (420 targeted) received short-term training.  Not a single participant failed to return from overseas training and the vast majority have been assigned to positions where they are effectively using their new skills, and where they often have replaced expensive expatriate staff, freeing more GOB and donor funds for other development activities.  Finally, although A.I.D. expected six spin-off donor-supported projects, only two actually occurred. Despite the project's overall success, counterparts were not provided to all OPEX technicians and the training provided did not always target those GOB personnel in a position to benefit the greatest number of people.  The follow-on Botswana Workforce and Skills Training Project will stress training personnel from those ministries and related institutions which have the greatest impact on employment generation. It is rcommended that OPEX technicians be required to report on their experiences and that greater effort be made to ensure that Ministry personnel understand A.I.D. training plans.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Participants|Management training|Education for development|Labor policy|Labor planning|Limited data","Botswana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP084.pdf","482 KB","008516 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the ability of the African Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF) to plan, manage, and evaluate its rural health services (RHS) and training programs in Kenya.  Final special evaluation covers the period 8/79-3/83 and is based on document review, field visits, and interviews with AMREF staff. Overall, the project has been a success.  The Kibwezi Rural Health Scheme has made progress in developing a comprehensive, integrated RHS system in the Kibwezi (formerly Makindu) division. Following an initial delay, the Kibwezi Health Center (HC) was built/equipped and has since (2 years) operated at full capacity, handling 40-50 inpatients and 3,000-5,000 outpatients per month and offering weekly maternal/child health, family planning, and mobile outreach clinics.  Also, 91 community health workers (CHW's) were trained and deployed and workshops/seminars were held for HC staff. The learning resources component published and distributed four (of a targeted 12) training manuals for rural health workers, of which three were translated; five more will be completed this year.  Two health journals, Defender (for the general public) and AFYA (for rural health workers) were produced and distributed. The RHS and training component improved AMREF's management, learning, and information systems by providing salaries, overseas training, office equipment and support, and funds for field studies and information dissemination.  As a result, AMREF experienced extraordinary growth; it now manages 33 projects and provides outreach services and medical radio communications to remote areas.  U.S. training included short-term courses (e.g., for two public health nurses) and M.P.H. degree programs (for two staff).  More than 19 documents detailing AMREF services were produced and distributed. Problems have included:  attrition of trained CHW's and a higher population growth than expected (only 25% of the division is receiving RHS); lack of community support for CHW's; less Ministry of Health project involvement than planned (AMREF will continue as implementors until MOH takeover is complete in 2/86). Recommendations are included.","Attached to PD-AAP-079","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID/afr-G-1560","","8/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Primary health care|Community health care|Integrated health care|Health facilities|Community health workers|Health education|Health outreach services|Institution building","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP079A.pdf","2,919 KB","000004 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish a community-based contraceptive distribution (CBD) system in five pueblos jovenes in Lima, Peru, and to expand the income-generating handicraft skills of women through work with mothers' clubs.  Special evaluation covers the period 1/82-6/83; no methodology is specified. Although the project had a slow start and will not meet its goals by the end of the funding period (8/83), it is one of the larger and more cost-efficient CBD projects in Peru.  A total of 40 family planning promotors and 240 distributors (vs. respective original targets of 36 and 360, and reduced targets of 20 and 240) have been trained, and of these, 20 and 114, respectively, are still working in CBD - a considerable achievement in comparison to other Peruvian CBD progams. The inititally high drop-out rate among distributors is lower among recent trainees, who have been selected on the basis of community leadership as well as other criteria, and the performance level has improved. Field staff generally are dedicated and serious about the CBD program. The project is serving 3,694 users (with 6,000 projected by 8/31/83), of whom 1,974 are new contraceptive acceptors (vs. 11,000 targeted new acceptors). Supervisory staff appear to be highly competent and motivated, but lack experience in dealing with problems of project design, information systems, and reporting.  Planning has not been systematic, largely because the original project design was never laid out very clearly. Considerable technical assistance in these areas is warranted. Mothers' clubs handicraft production activities did not begin until 7/82.  Already, operating in 4 areas, they have generated almost one million soles of income and 555,000 soles of profits for participating women.  A 175,000-sole revolving fund has been set up for purchase of supplies. Key recommendations are to:  extend the project at least 6 months at no additional cost; develop a data system for improved accuracy in user counts; reconsider the link between mothers' clubs and CBD; and allow project staff to visit other programs and receive specialized training.","Attached to PD-AAP-088","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Urban areas|Women in development|Income|Handicrafts|Community based delivery|Contraceptive distribution|Beneficiary count|Limited data","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP088A.pdf","426 KB","","","008591 - USAID.

"Evaluates P.L. 480 Title I program to provide rice commodities to help Liberia meet its foreign exchange requirements and to generate funds for agricultural and rural development projects. Special evaluation covers the period 8/80-7/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with Government of Liberia (GOL), USAID/L, and other project personnel. As part of a larger U.S. assistance effort (including Emergency Support Funds), the program (comprising 4 agreements) has provided some economic stabilization in Liberia in the uncertain aftermath of the 1980 coup and had a positive effect on USAID/L's development objectives. Supplying about half of Liberia's rice import needs, the program has: helped meet the domestic rice production shortfall, but has not been an undue disincentive to domestic production; assured the urban population an ample supply of staple food; helped the GOL maintain its rice producer subsidy; generated sales proceeds to support GOL self-help development projects (17, mostly agricultural projects are underway); and provided U.S. leverage over GOL policies and programs. The program has been hampered by:  the continuing decline of the Liberian economy; lack of GOL regulation of commercial rice import licenses which has impeded the timely sale of P.L. 480 rice; lack of communication and coordination among GOL agencies, especially in counterpart programming and implementation of self-help projects; tardy and incomplete GOL compliance reporting which has hindered project assessment; and slow generation and transfer of sales proceeds from the Liberian Produce Marketing Corporation to the GOL counterpart fund due in part to lack of a linking mechanism.  The latter has caused the GOL to draw counterpart funds from its general fund, resulting in delayed and sometimes inadequate disbursements.  Also, the GOL lost money on the 1980/1981 agreements because world market rice prices were higher than the GOL-subsidized retail price. Recommendations are to maintain the current funding level (higher funding might hinder domestic production) and seek authorization for a multiyear Title I rice program.","Attached to PD-AAP-081|Evaluation period: Jul-Aug 1983","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title I|Economic stabilization|Rice|Imports|Foreign exchange|Commodities","Liberia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP081A.pdf","4,882 KB","008570 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the Royal Thai Government's (RTG) capability to address key development needs.  Midterm special evaluation covers the period 8/80-12/83 and is based on document review and interviews with project personnel and trainees. Despite its short existence, the project, being implemented by the Department of Technical and Economic Cooperation (DTEC) and USAID/T, has had a remarkable impact - introducing high technology (for which the United States has clearly emerged as a primary source), promoting coordination among RTG agencies, and supporting the latter's capacity to carry out development activities on their own.  Currently, the project is providing TA to l5 RTG agencies.  Assistance has led to policy and planning reforms at the National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB), the Bureau of Budget, the Office of the Auditor General, and the Comptroller General's Department.  An urbanization and transport study has helped lay the basis for a project to solve Bangkok's mass transportation problems, while technical surveys and recommendations on pollution problems at the National Environment Board led to installaton of an air pollution monitoring systemn in Metropolitan Bangkok.  In addition, U.S., in-country, and third-country training has been given or is being planned for over 150 RTG personnel.  On the negative side, the project has lacked systematic follow-up to identify activities most likely to successfully replicated, and considerable delays have been caused by AID/W inefficiency in identifying TA and training resources. Recommendations are, inter alia, that:  the DTEC immediately prepare for the expanded follow-up project being contemplated (including preparing guidelines for consultants and establishing a representative at the Thai embassy in Washington, D.C. to help identify consultant and training institutions); the analytically highly capable NESDB play a greater role in problem identification, especially in clarifying guidelines for national 5-year plans; and that in order to obviate brain drain, participant training focus on civil service personnel who are required to return to their former positions.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Development administration|Development policy|Development planning|Institution building|National level|Beneficiary interviews","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP098.pdf","8,879 KB","","","008613 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase agricultural production and reverse environmental deterioration in Thailand's Mae Chaem watershed. Special evaluation covers the period 8/80-7/83 and is based on interviews with project staff, local officials, fieldworkers, and villagers. Despite the fact that the project took 7 years to plan and is in its third year, very little implementation has taken place.  The major reasons for this have been:  (1) a freeze on A.I.D. funding for nearly a year, due to the Royal Thai Government's (RTG) initial failure to meet the condition precedent that it provide land security to farmers on government land who agree to abandon slash and burn farming practices; (2) lack of an adequate management structure to coordinate the work of RTG line agencies; and (3) a slow, cumbersome financial management system.  Recently however, considerable progress has been made in developing project management and a field operations strategy. The project's special interface teams are achieving their purpose of facilitating communication among villagers, project management staff, and RTG line agencies and have worked well with line agency fieldworkers to coordinate their activities at the village level.  Although the training provided the teams was appropriate, more technical training would further increase team credibility with villager and RTG officials. With most of the implementation problems overcome, it appears that the project has the potential to preserve the Mae Chaem watershed and provide worthwhile benefits to area farmers.  Major recommendations are to:  (1) extend the project 2 years to make up for lost time, consolidate it into two phases, and reduce its geographic coverage to only five Mae Chaem subdistricts; (2) focus on encouraging behavioral changes in the local population, which can be facilitated by further training of interface team members, more self-help funding, more rapid implementation of land security efforts, and more efforts to help subsistence farmers gradually move toward farming of cash crops; and (3) improve the coordination of project and line agency staff at the district and provincial levels.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural development|Natural resource conservation|Watersheds","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP020.pdf","3,814 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates project to establish a discount facility, the Rural Development Agribusiness Fund (FRAI), in the Central Bank of Peru (CBP) to provide loans through intermediary credit institutions (ICI's) to rural poor agribusinesses.  Special evaluation covers the period 12/78-9/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews. A.I.D.'s first attempt to finance agroindustry, the Private Investment Fund project (1968-1976), had 80% of its funding deobligated because:  (1) a government hostile to private-sector development took controlin 1968; (2) the interest rate spread was not sufficient to induce commercial financial institutions to take advantage of intermediate funds; and (3) excessive restrictions were placed on the use of funds.  Despite this initial failure, A.I.D. continued to support agribusiness by establishing FRAI in 1978 which increased incentives for the participation of ICI's participation and benefitted from the formation of a government committed to private-sector development. The FRAI has been well-administered by COFIDE, a semi-autonomous unit of the CPB.  Areas for COFIDE's improvement include: clarifying its role with the private sector and improving internal communications; improving financial and economic analyses of loan requests; and increasing FRAI publicity. The ICI's serve FRAI by disbursing loans.  A survey and analysis of ICI's reveals that: (1) firms located on the coast have received 77% of the funds distributed, (special efforts are needed to incorporate inland areas), (2) all loans are being made to project target groups; (3) about 30% of firms receiving loans are owned by larger conglomerates; (4) average loan size has been close to the amount anticipated; and (5) about 37% of funds have financed new activities. Loan impact has been unclear because:  (1) drastic macroeconomic influences have obscured results; (2) many borrowers have been owned by larger firms which has confused financial statements; (3) some firms have received loans from other sources; (4) most firms have purchased raw materials from wholesalers and have been unaware if small-scale farmers supplied inputs; and (5) there has been too little time to determine loan impact.","Attached to PD-AAP-112","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/OTR-C-0016","","11/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Agribusiness|Rural development|Agricultural production credit|Private sector|Loans|Beneficiary count","Peru","","","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates project in Ecuador to establish a rural technology transfer system; to form, coordinate, and strengthen linkages among agricultural research, education, and extension (REE) institutions; and to develop and disseminate small farm technology.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/80-3/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project staff. Some progress has been made in achieving project objectives.  A rudimentary institutional system has begun to emerge:  the National Science and Technology Council (CONACYT) has set up procedures for developing, reviewing, selecting, and implementing agricultural S&T projects and is working with an increasing number of REE agencies. Eight subprojects (SP's) have been approved for funding by USAID/E and CONACYT in technology development and diffusion, institutional development, and human resources improvement; three other SP's have received CONACYT's approval only.  All SP's are well integrated into their Government of Ecuador executing agencies and most have established formal working relations with other public, but not private, institutions. Only four of the SP's have begun generating new technologies; the others are conducting preliminary research and baseline data surveys.  One SP is providing training to two M.S. candidates, with two more to follow, at the University of Florida (UF). Rural Development Division staff have been increased to three (vs. the planned eight); staff inservice training has been limited and only one member has received special training (five days in Costa Rica). The project has been hampered by:  conceptual differences between A.I.D., UF, CONACYT and executing agencies on the role of Title XII universities and U.S. TA; SP approval and fund disbursement processes that are not poorly defined, understood, or followed; fiscal-legal differences over the fungibility of loan and grant funds; inadequate communication among the participants with increasing interpersonal conflict; lack of compliance with three conditions precedent to the loan agreement; failure to clearly define the roles and responsibilites of A.I.D., CONACYT and UF. Recommendations are included.","Attached to PD-AAP-136|Bibcode changed from 32 to 22, 2008-05-19","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Technology transfer|Title XII Foreign Assistance Act|Rural development|Small farms|Agricultural technology|Agricultural research|Institution building","Ecuador","","","","","","English","","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation|Evaluation team","","Whittaker, Morris|Jaramillo, Mario","","Mar 1983","","","","First annual evaluation of AID project : ""rural technology transfer system""","","XD-AAP-136-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTgyMDky","Indonesia","5180032"
"Evaluates project to help the Dominican Republic's Instituto Superior Agricultura (ISA) to establish a Center for the Administration of Rural Development (CADR).  Special evaluation covers the period 6/81-6/83; methodology is not described. Due to delays in P.L. 480 counterpart funding and difficulties in recruiting a senior management advisor, most activities have been delayed 6-12 months.  The project goal of 118 case studies in rural development management is probably not attainable. Only 28 case studies and 11 teaching exercises have been prepared to date, but both quantity and quality are satisfactory - given the inadequacy of available data, the lack of a case method tradition in the Dominican Republic, the short supply of case leads, and the difficulties posed by working with public, as opposed to private, institutions. ISA has offered 9 special seminar programs (attended by some 525 persons) and one 7-week management program (now an integral and popular offering for ISA students but a highly inconvenient length for clients). The new 5-month degree program which will be offered when CADR officially opens devotes too much time to ""soft"" subjects (e.g., group dynamics) and too little to such topics as marketing, international economics, finance, and management control.  CADR facilities should be completed by mid 1984, approximately one year behind schedule; the buildings are excellent in both design and construction. Seven ISA faculty are enrolled in U.S. Master's programs, but most are not in programs which use the case method.  Given the low ISA salaries, the biggest challenge ISA/CADR will face will be to retain faculty who have returned with Master's degrees. It is recommended that CADR develop:  (1) close relationships with government, business, and academic communities, as potential sources of both clients and cooperation; and (2) expertise in a few priority areas (e.g., in marketing, finance, and policy in the sugar, coffee, cacao, and tobacco industries).","Attached to PD-AAP-144","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Agricultural development|Management training|Management education|Educational centers|Management research|Limited data","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP144A.pdf","434 KB","","","008537 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve and expand technical/vocational education at the secondary and postsecondary levels in the Dominican Republic.  Special evaluation covers the period 7/82-5/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel. The project has had little success.  Although the Fundacion de Credito Educativo (FCE) has disbursed over 400 AID-funded student loans, none have gone to the targeted lower-income groups. Lacking labor market data with which to devise a new scheme to analyze loan risk based on students' future (after-training) income projections, the FCE has continued to grant loans based on recipients' current ability to repay, thus disqualifying those from lower-income groups. No institutional loans have been disbursed.  Although needs assessments forms (a preliminary to applying for loans) have been completed by 17 secondary and postsecondary insitutions and are being analyzed by FCE and Texas A&M University (TAMU) TA staff, they contain inadequate data.  Further, no institutional development plans (on which loan decisions were to have been based) have been drawn up. The TAMU team has successfully completed a systems analysis report (the recommendations of which the FCE has resisted adopting, e.g., to purchase administrative computer software packages), is helping FCE prepare regional profiles and a bibliography of existing labor market studies, and has visited all collaborating institutions.  However the planned labor market survey (necessary for establishing training priorities and devising a new loan disbursal system) will not be finished and there has been no FCE staff inservice or overseas training and little institutional TA follow-up. The project has been hampered by:  an overly-ambitious project calendar; lack of communication among TAMU, FCE, and USAID/H staff resulting in misunderstood roles and poor working relationships (especially between TAMU and FCE); and FCE's failure to provide counterparts trained in vocational education and labor market issues. Recommendations are included.","Attached to PD-AAP-143|Evaluation period: Apr 25-29, 1983","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Educational facilities|Loans|Student loans|Credit|Secondary education|Higher education|Educational finance|Vocational training|Beneficiary count","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP143A.pdf","829 KB","001378 - Latin American Scholarship Program of American Universities","","008537 - USAID.

"Evaluates projects to help the Government of the Dominican Republic (GODR) to strengthen basic health services.  Special evaluation covers the period 10/75-5/83, and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with A.I.D. and GODR personnel and with health workers. The projects have helped to create and expand a rural health delivery system - Servicios Basicos de Salud (SBS) - which provides more than 2 million persons (80-90% of the rural population) with access to primary health care.  The SBS infrastructure includes 5,197 promoters, 529 supervisors of promoters, 31 area supervisors, 7 regional supervisors, and a central office.  Data, although not entirely reliable, indicate that infant mortality, child mortality (age 1-4), and fertility and birth rates have all declined in project areas, while use of contraception has increased.  Moreover, GODR budgetary support of SDS, notably in the form of salaries, reflects real commitment to rural health and preventive medicine.  Other positive features of SBS are strong community involvement and excellent immunization coverage. Nonetheless, the SBS should be achieving much more.  The productivity of promoters and their direct supervisors seems to have declined during the past 2 years, except in immunization and possibly family planning. Activities related to hygiene, nutrition, prenatal care, and collection of vital statistics are accomplished only inconsistently and seem of questionable quality (partly perhaps because of the number of households assigned per promoter).  Motivation among promoters and supervisors is very poor (the supervisory system is virtually nonfunctional), and only minimal efforts have been made in the areas of continuing education and retraining.  Other problems include inadequate logistics, insufficient decentralization of authority, unreliable data collection, and a weak SBS information system. SBS must be led back from its present directionless state to its original goals and objectives.  Effective management support to the existing infrastructure will make it possible to revive the SBS's neglected preventative functions, to add new functions, and to expand its coverage.  Several detailed recommendations are made, chief among them continued A.I.D. and GODR budgetary support.","Loan nos. 517-U-028, 517-U-030|Attached to PD-AAP-138","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Primary health care|Change agents|Health workers|Preventive medicine|Immunizations","Dominican Republic","","","000750 - Management Sciences for Health (MSH)","","008537 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to upgrade the tax collection capability of the Income Tax Department (ITD) of the Government of Sierra Leone's Ministry of Finance (MOF).  Special evaluation covers the period ending 12/83 and is based on document review and staff interviews. Despite early setbacks, goals have been met and in some cases exceeded, and the project has contributed significantly in a time of economic depression to increased revenues in all areas, including the difficult area of personal taxes (which includes taxes on profits of small businesses).  Particular achievements include, inter alia:  (1) development of procedures manuals and of less time-consuming administrative procedures and internal forms, including procedures for the Payroll Tax and PAYE (Pay-as-you earn withholding) collection systems and procedures permitting access to other government departments, especially the Department of Customs and Excise and the Ministry of Trade; (2) valuable input into the system provided by the 10 ITD managers trained overseas and 125 others trained (in excess of targeted numbers) on-the-job; and (3) development of the rudiments of a Master File (already incorporated in two functions), an incentive awards program, an employer's kit to help answer common questions on withholding, and a taxpayer education program (now pending MOF approval). Reliable statistical and accounting data allowing evaluation of the rate of progress made under the project are still lacking, however, as are guidelines to ensure employee integrity in collecting taxes. Major constraints have included a shortage of ITD staff due to a government restriction on hiring (although measures to obviate the shortage were available); the MOF's removal of collection files from the ITD; the absence of feedback from the ITD; delays in introducing enforcement procedures, establishing an internal audit section (due in part to staff shortages), and approving the taxpayer education program; and the vacuum created by the departure of the senior technical advisor. Finding a replacement is chief among the recommendations made.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Tax collection|Government departments|Institution building|Management operations|Beneficiary interviews","Sierra Leone","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP149.pdf","981 KB","008602 - USAID.

"Evaluates Save the Children Foundation (SCF) project to institutionalize a community-based integrated rural development process (CBIRD) in Tunisia's Siliana province.  Mid-term special evaluation covers the period 1978-83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with concerned officials and participants. While results have varied, there have been enough successes to indicate the effectiveness of the CBIRD methodology in Tunisia. This success - continuation of which will require prudent SCF follow-up - is ascribed to SCF's attention to community needs and dynamics in the planning process and to SCF's intensive supervision, broad community involvement in working for and managing the project, the absence of other Government of Tunisia (GOT) programs, and strong linkages with other community resources. Replicable techniques were developed in several projects, e.g., the mother/child clinic in Makthar and the Mansoura Productivity Center.  That other projects succeeded only moderately or completely failed was due to insufficient information and inappropriate project selection and planning, the little time allotted to developing the group process, and staff members' lack of group dynamics skills.  Also, due to a lack of consistent criteria and of feasibility studies, some communities chosen for the project were not ready for a participatory approach. The rapid turnover of SCF directors in the first 5.5 years nearly destroyed the project, but the current leadership is providing stability.  However, SCF personnel need more systematic training in both methodological and technical areas and an increase in sheer numbers. The highly centralized GOT bureaucracy and SCF's limited technical capacity made formal training by SCF of GOT personnel unrealistic; less formal modes of institutionalization have proved more effective, but dramatic results are not expected in the near future.  It is recommended that SCF pomote institutionalization not by following the training approach specified in the Phase II OPG but by creating a Tunisian SCF organization.  If the substantial new SCF and USAID/T resources - including a feasibility study - needed for the latter are not available, the program should be phased out.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Community development|Private voluntary organizations|Community participation|Beneficiary interviews","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP151.pdf","1,614 KB","001407 - Save the Children (U.S.)","","008616 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the capability of the Bureau de Credit Agricole (BCA) to provide credit, savings, and other financial services to Haiti's rural inhabitants.  Special evaluation covers the period to 9/83 and is based on document review and interviews with BCA, Institut de Developpement Agricole et Industriel, contractor, and USAID/H officials. Progress has been made in a number of areas and BCA has moved closer to becoming a viable institution.  Its financial management capabilities (i.e., liquidity, interest, and repayment rates, reporting procedures, and bad debt accounts) have been bolstered.  Voluntary savings have been increased and new services introduced to clients.  A survey of staff attitudes has been conducted to help improve personnel management capabilities. Unfortunately, it does not provide for a mechanism for implementing change.  Three other studies have been prepared to provide information on credit markets, two general and one specific.  The general studies have been hampered by a lack of data and the specific survey has lacked sufficiently extensive questionnaires upon which to draw conclusions. Four seminars on financial management topics have been provided to BCA staff and computer training has been given to 7 persons in Haiti and 3 in the U.S.  Some 38 persons have received loan coding training in Haiti and 2 participants have been given personnel and development management training in the U.S..  An ADP system has been put in place, but hardware problems have delayed its implementation.  While construction of 8 buildings to house BCA offices suffered delays due to both BCA and contractor error, all were expected to be completed by 12/15/83. Recommendations are to:  extend the team leader's services and expand his duties; push the Government of Haiti to meet its commitment to fund BCA's operating deficit; support BCA borrowing from private and public sources; finance a matching program to provide savers with ten cents for each dollar deposited; finance duplication of the studies to be distributed to all professional staff; have the team leader accept responsibility for insuring that study findings are reflected in planning and procedures; and provide short-term TA if needed.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Financial institutions|Financial management|Credit|Savings|Personnel management","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP170.pdf","1,266 KB","001283 - University of Wisconsin at Madison.

"Evaluates project to improve and expand the institutional capacity of the Lesotho Cooperative Credit Union League (LCCUL) and its member credit unions (CU's).  Special evaluation covers the period 1/82-8/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with LCCUL staff and others. With the satisfactory achievement of most of its objectives, the project has had an important effect on the development of the Lesotho CU movement.  Although unrealistic targets, a focus on strengthening existing CU's, and a lengthy CU formation process kept growth in new CU's and in CU membership lower than planned, CU shares and savings (the latter up 54%) showed strong increases.  Nearly all LCCUL positions have been staffed (women, 70% of the 26,000 CU members, play a substantial role as CU directors/clerks and as LCCUL senior staff and committee members); 47 new CU clerks have been hired, with salary assistance for 29 from Catholic Relief Services.  Detailed LCCUL job descriptions and a personnel manual have been completed and 32 statements standardizing loan processing procedures are being developed (although implementation of the latter has been inadequate).  With the addition of a field manager, supervision of LCCUL field officers (FO's) has been increased and FO's have redirected their efforts from village campaigns to providing TA/training to CU staff.  Extensive training, mostly on-the-job, has also been delivered to LCCUL staff, FO's, and committee and board members in CU management, bookkeeping, accounting, loan appraisal, etc.  Other activities have included:  expanding the Small Farmer Production Credit program (agricultural committees are operating in 19 CU's); promoting CU's in weekly radio programs; and building 16 CU offices in 1983 (15 are budgeted for 1984) with funding from MISERIOR (acronym not identified). However, despite efforts to improve control, LCCUL collection of loans/interest due has been poor; loan delinquency has averaged 25%. Resulting tight lending policies (restricted to member savings) and a lack of viable applications have kept loan volume low.  LCCUL financial self-sufficiency has also been hampered by inadequate billing and collection of LCCUL dues and a low level of capitalization. Nineteen recommendations are included.","Attached to PD-AAP-171","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Credit|Financial management|Credit unions|Loans|Beneficiary count","Lesotho","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP171A.pdf","1,297 KB","001794 - University of Wisconsin at Madison","","008569 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase Haitian income and employment by improving the quality of business products.  Special evaluation covers the period 7/81-6/82 and is based on document review, indepth interviews, and site visits. The Haitian Development Foundation (HDF) has made good progress. The number of loans approved has increased from 88 to 214 and of clients assisted with TA and/or loans from 302 to 431; HDF membership has risen from 122 to 177.  There has also been a remarkable reduction in the fund-raising operations deficit.  The key element of the HDF, the animateurs, are being trained in all aspects of small business administration:  accounting, record keeping, inventory control, procurement, credit management, marketing, and rural development assistance.  Previous evaluations estimated that four jobs would be created by each loan; however, the average has been closer to two new jobs per loan.  Income and productivity levels of the targeted small privately-owned businesses is increasing.  The internal management of HDF and its fund raising operations have improved considerably. Operating deficits have been reduced and progress has also been made toward achieving the long-range goal of economic development impact on the targeted community.  After a second year of experiments, some at a very high cost, the HDF director has an excellent staff.  Some minor problems still exist; however, the general feeling is optimistic for HDF's future operations under its present management. Recommendations include:  the project director should put loan collectors in the credit department.  The board of director's terms should be increased to a 2-year term with half the board being elected each year.  HDF should closely monitor the animateurs' preparation of quarterly financial statements for each client.  New jobs generated and the salaries of all new employees should be indicated.  HDF should avoid increasing its budget due to its precarious financial situation.  The credit department should have a fire-proof file cabinet or safe to keep all the clients' files and other documents.  Finally, an official policy should be made by the directors to determine when a loan is in default.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Small scale enterprises|Development projects|Loans|Labor productivity|Income level|Defaults","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP174.pdf","2,763 KB","000933 - Yale University.

"Evaluates project to strengthen th capability of the Government of Haiti Department of Public Health and Population (DSPP) to provide low-cost health care to the rural poor.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/79-2/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with DSPP, USAID/H, contractor, and other personnel. The project has not yet had a significant impact on Haiti's overall national health status and can not meet the target of supplying health care to 70% of the rural population. Nevertheless, eight rural dispensaries have been built or renovated, with another 43 in progress. Some 550 health agents have been trained or retrained and 350 auxiliary nurses/supervisors have received project workshop training and been posted subsequently to rural areas.  Management training seminars have been conducted for district and central-level administrators and bureau chiefs.  Health curricula have been designed and ten modules (two of which were pre-tested) developed for health agent training. Yet, development of DSPP's institutional capacities has proceeded slowly and the project has had little impact on the pace of regionalization, even though new West and Transversal regions have been established.  A major accomplishment has been the creation of the Community Pharmacy Drug Supply Agency (AGAPCO), which has begun to supply drugs to local pharmacies, but AGAPCO lacks the managerial competency necessary for freestanding operations.  Seven computerized management information systems have been or are in the process of being developed by the contractor and DSPP, yet the lack of DSPP involvement in and ownership of these systems has caused problems.  An excess of information collected thus far has been undigestible and unusable. Health information systems have been established and health statistics reporting from various regions bolstered. However, problems with the data collected, a lack of supplies, organization, and trained staff, and delays in receiving funds for purchasing forms and equipment have limited its effectiveness. Recommendations are made.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Health delivery|Health outreach services|Institution building|Management information systems|Health professional education|Health workers|Curriculum design","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP177.pdf","4,041 KB","008554 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish a Resource Training Center (RTC) in Haiti to provide technical training to semiskilled and unskilled rural workers.  Special mid-term evaluation covers the period 11/80-8/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with USAID/H, RTC, and host government personnel and with trainees and staff of RTC's client organizations. Objectives cannot be met by project end.  While the RTC is much needed in Haiti, demand for the center's services has not been high, partly because interpersonal disagreements caused the RTC to close down for 2 months in 1982 and partly because of inadequate publicity efforts. Nonetheless, the quality (as opposed to quantity) of the RTC's training programs has been satisfactory (and is expected to improve, as there is now a competent consultant aboard as well as more technical personnel). The program has evidently improved trainees' job performance, but trainees are rarely  ewarded for this by promotion or a salary raise, causing subsequent decreased motivation.  There are currently agreements for 6 courses to be given in the next year, with 18 more under discussion.  Training evaluation studies have generally been neglected. The RTC is divided into separate technical and administrative sections.  The RTC director has concentrated on administrative tasks, neglecting the more relevant technical areas.  Staff performance, except in public relations and evaluation, is generally good.  Accounting procedures have improved somewhat although they are still partially unsatisfactory. TA by the contractor has been satisfactory, but USAID/H has failed to monitor the RTC closely enough and financial contributions by client organizations and the Ministry of National Education (DEN) are below expectations. Major recommendations are to amend the administrative structure; increase the staff of the technical section; step up publicity; limit the contractor's role to advice and assistance; conduct a financial audit as soon as possible; keep the RTC semi-autonomous and under the DEN's guardianship; and revise both the project's objectives and DEN's financial contribution to more realistic levels and then make their fulfillment a requirement for future funding.","French ed.: PD-AAT-352","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-1054-C-00-1034-00","","9/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Training centers|Technical training|Institution building|Beneficiary interviews","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP178.pdf","1,811 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"Evaluates project to develop and apply an improved small farmer credit and inputs system in three Egyptian governorates.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/79-3/83 and is based on interviews with farmers and project personnel, and on available statistical data. From a strictly developmental point of view, the project is already, at only the halfway point of implementation, enormously successful.  It has already exceeded the targeted number of farmers and it is clear that the expected income and production increases have been met as well. However, the project has not fulfilled its avowed experimental nature - its intent to develop and apply an optimal combination of agricultural extension and credit.  Instead, implementation has gone directly to the application stage without fully testing all the options first. For this reason, the effects of credit with or without extension and the income and production changes in project vs. nonproject areas remain unknown. Nonetheless, the project has had a significant impact on the availability and productive use of short- and medium-term credit, which in turn has, in combination with an active extension program, resulted in increased farm production. Of the outputs, the improved credit system is the most successful to date.  Other outputs are progressing at varying rates of speed and success.  The planned development of an improved storage and handling system, however, has been hampered by policies regarding the respective roles of the public and private sectors. A key recommendation is to determine if the project is indeed experimental in nature, and if so, to commit the additional resources needed to fulfill this objective, i.e., to expand the project so that activities can be conducted in entire districts (rather than in single villages as at present) and testing and demonstration of project interventions can become a reality. Lesson learned:  The more convoluted the project design, the more likely that the project will achieve some, rather than all, of its objectives.

"Evaluates project to support the Gambian Opportunities Industrialization Center's (TGOIC) program to provide agricultural training and follow-up assistance to early school leavers.  Special evaluation covers the project phase-out period (CY1982) approved under Amendment No. 1 and is based on document review and interviews with TGOIC and local officials and with TGOIC graduates. The project has met its revised targets.  A total of 53 (vs. 50 planned) students have been graduated, resettled on their farms, and provided with technology/input packages and follow-up extension visits; several of these student farmers have produced yields higher than national historical figures.  However, TGOIC has failed to provide students with instruction on animal traction or animal health, although pullocks were provided as part of the package.  Some 40% of those interviewed had sick or dead bulls. The project's provision of free training and an expensive technology/input package may have created some problems:  (1) a potential weakening of the extended family by making farming more individualistic and less communal; (2) creation of false expectations for future TGOIC programs (it is unlikely the Center will continue to exist); (3) altered perceptions regarding the acquisition of agricultural credit and equipment; and (4) a burden on the Gambian government, and possibly A.I.D., to determine a means to keep TGOIC operating. TGOIC maintenance and financial control have been inadequate. TGOIC is currently seeking new funding sources to continue operations, but it is uncertain whether these efforts will be successful.  If not, it is possible that the project operated by the Cooperative League of the U.S.A. (CLUSA) could make use of the Center. Recommendations are:  (1) if A.I.D. wishes to provide limited assistance to TGOIC graduates, animal health services would be the most helpful; (2) TGOIC should make sure its graduates understand that little material help will be available in the future; (3) TGOIC student files constitute a small data-base on Gambian farmers and should be made available to socioeconomic researchers.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural training|Training centers|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews|Public data|Limited data plus","Gambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP208.pdf","1,486 KB","000026 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop a capability within the Government of Kenya's (GOK's) Ministry of Economic Planning and Development (MEPD), and at the district level, for decentralized rural development planning. PES covers the period through 9/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with MEPD and USAID/K officials. Substantial progress has been made following a top-level 1982 GOK decision to make districts the focus of all aspects of rural planning and development.  The MEPD's Rural Planning Division has assigned capable advisors, both Kenyan and expatriate, to work with district officials and assist them on a day-to-day basis to implement local decentralization measures.  An admirable manual on the selection and planning of rural development projects has been produced.  The project has also assisted GOK ministries in meeting the financial management and disaggregation demands of the district focus policy; the provision of microcomputers has been a major help in these areas.  GOK capabilities in, e.g., district accounting, personnel development, and tendering have also been bolstered. Seven of nine participants have completed overseas training; of these, five are working directly with the project.  In-country, district team training workshops were conducted in 1979 and 1981 and larger-scale briefing seminars on district focus, involving 1,200 GOK officials, in 1983.  An ambitious program of education and reorientation to be conducted at all levels of government and society has been outlined. USAID/K's flexible project management and the presence of talented, dedicated advisors have been key factors in the project's success. areas, e.g., disagreggating ministerial budgets, deploying officers to the field, establishing district treasuries, defining the role of the District Development Officer, and re-orienting District Commissioners and other key officers at the headquarters and in the field.  It is strongly recommended that a full complement of advisors be continued throughout the next planning cycle. As the future unfolds, everything will depend on continued GOK determination to impose the district focus policy on ministries and to radically alter bureaucratic and financial structures within the government.","Attached to PD-AAP-210","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Districts|Government policy|Institution building|Development planning|Decentralization","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP210A.pdf","2,163 KB","","","008565 - USAID.

"Evaluates two multidonor projects (local costs of which are financed through a Commodity Import Program) to upgrade the institutional capacities of Government of Kenya (GOK) ministries - Phase II of the Technical Assistance Pool (TAP) and the allied Agriculture TAP (ATAP) project, both implemented by the Harvard Institute for International Development.  Special evaluation covers the period 10/81-10/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with TAP, GOK, USAID/K, and other personnel. Slow but genuine progress in institution building has been achieved, especially within the Ministry of Agriculture's (MOA) Management Systems Unit (MSU), which has developed a computerized budgeting, allocation, and expenditure monitoring system.  Also, cost-benefit analyses of agricultural projects have been conducted, and systems for vehicle monitoring, personnel management, and recordkeeping are being developed. The interministerial task force on budget/financial processes has held four productive 2-day meetings involving 70 Kenyan officials.  Focusing primarily on long-term policy issues (a 6-month work plan, the livestock sector section of the 5-year national plan, etc.) and with TAP advisors well-integrated into the division and Kenyan staff involved at all planning levels, the Development Planning Division (DPD) of the Ministry of Livestock Development has also made good institutional progress. Less progress has been made in the Natural Resources Division of the Ministry of Economic Planning and Development (where the TAP advisor has not been fully integrated into the work plan) and in the MOA' Development Planning Division.  The latter has prepared work plans, but these tend to be supplanted by policy crises; meetings have been infrequent, morale low, and collaboration between TAP advisors and Kenyan staff minimal.  A major obstacle in the MOA/DPD (and overall) has been the GOK's serious inability to recruit/retain enough qualified staff.  Training efforts have similarly been hampered; although six staff have completed U.S. graduate programs and several others are currently studying or set to go, no University of Nairobi Master's training and only limited short-term training has taken place. Recommendations are included.","Attached to PD-AAP-213","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Government departments|Agricultural policy|Agricultural planning","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP213A.pdf","2,212 KB","","","008565 - USAID.

"Evaluates food assistance efforts in a drought relief project in Bolivia.  Special evaluation covers the period 5/83-12/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project officials and beneficiaries. Given Bolivia's economic and political conditions, the project has been successful, despite inaccurate USAID/B preproject assumptions.  To date, the National Rice Institute (ENA) has sold at least 90% of P.L. 480 Title II and Title III rice at subsidized, controlled prices in departmental capitals.  However, the ENA has accorded priority to salaried workers and organizations in urban areas and has made no effort to reach rural victims, who have been hit hardest by the drought, because ENA assumed - falsely - that they were bereft of cash.  This has led to growing resentment toward the ENA among campesinos. Further, ENA's poor administrative and bookkeeping procedures and likely petty corruption (noted in a recent A.I.D. audit) has led to considerable duplication in food sales and related inequities; e.g., up to 20% of the subsidized rice sold by ENA was resold at nearly a 400% markup, frequently to rural drought victims. National Community Development Services (NCDS), Food for the Hungry International (FHI), and CARITAS were to distribute free food to about 5,000 small communities under a Food for Work (FFW) program.  NCDS and probably also FHI, however, lack the capacity to implement a project of this magnitude and distribution methods were not designed to reach those in remote locations, focusing instead on those near departmental capitals.  Also, the FFW approach tended to impede the goal of distributing food, since many communities had already implemented emergency-related projects at their own initiative.  Although the PVO's have made laudable efforts, all three need careful management, increased supervision, better population targeting, and budget reviews. A total of 47 recommendations focus on the need to:  (1) expand the number of direct program administrators in La Paz and in the field; (2) create a data collection system to monitor program impact on intended beneficiaries; (3) establish a program to recapitalize drought-affected altiplano farmers; and (4) refocus distribution efforts to the most needy rural populations.","Attached to PD-AAP-218","Special Evaluation","Documents","511-4000-C-00-4010-00","","12/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Drought|Emergency food distribution|Food for Peace Title II|Food for Peace Title III|Food for work|Beneficiary interviews","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP218A.pdf","2,114 KB","008515 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish an integrated oilseeds and vegetable oil production, processing, and marketing system within a farmer-controlled cooperative (co-op) structure in India. Special evaluation covers the period 6/79-6/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with USAID/I, Government of India (GOI), National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), and contractor personnel and with co-op members. Overall project performance has been impressive.  Of the AID-funded co-op federations planned for eight production districts in five states: those in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh have been rapidly organized and staffed; those in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, only recently started, were delayed by the state governments' concern over NDDB's strong project role and its effect on federation independence; and the one in Tamil Nadu has been slowed by a severe drought.  A pilot management information system has been implemented in Gujarat.  Although production enhancement programs have been delayed in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, in Madhya Pradesh numerous field trials and farmer demonstrations have been conducted at the federation-established farm and agronomic center. However, the project has been set back by:  the late arrival, distribution, and sale of the initial P.L. 480 oil shipment (on which project funding was dependent); the suspension of further oil shipments due to an unresolved dispute between A.I.D. and the GOI over U.S. rights to audit financial records; and severe storms that devastated much of the groundnut crop in Gujarat.  As a result, procurement has been below target; processing (also hampered by inadequate storage, handling, power, transportation, and mechanization and by cumbersome GOI plant licensing procedures) has achieved only 64% of the target; and donated oil sales have been lower than expected (despite high market demand and prices).  Financial management of NDDB, the federations, and the processing plants has been weak and the revolving procurement fund inadequate; the NDDB needs greater flexibility in using the capital budget and plant managers greater discretion over raw material procurement to maximize plant utilization.","Attached to PD-AAP-219","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Oil crops|Vegetable oils|Agricultural cooperatives|Food processing|Crop production|Beneficiary interviews","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP219A.pdf","6,427 KB","008557 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to promote reforestation and agroforestry activities (especially tree cash-cropping) among peasants in Haiti. Special evaluation covers the 2-year period to 9/83, and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with USAID/H, Pan American Development Foundation (PADF), Operation Double Harvest (ODH), CARE, and other personnel. Overall progress has been good.  Focusing on small-scale, village-level agroforestry activities and with flexible, high-quality staffs, the PADF and CARE SP's have been most successful.  PADF's 3 regional extension teams have helped 42 organizations (with 160 PADF subgrants) to establish 19 seedling nurseries (hardwood nurseries have been unexpectedly profitable) and plant 4,022,000 (vs. a 4-year target of 3 million) trees. Promising research on small-scale tree plantations has also been conducted. PADF staff emphasis on tree planting has limited development of the planned Agroforestry Resource Center.  After a slow start, the CARE SP has established 6 nurseries and through its 2 extension teams helped 3,128 (vs. a 4-year target of 3,500) farmers plant 1,173,000 trees in 2 northwest regions.  CARE has had most success planting on individually-owned property with owner participation. Although CARE has had difficulty in identifying qualified mid-level Haitian staff for training, Haitians have been effectively trained to participate in day-to-day agroforestry activities.  CARE's village animators are paid a flat salary, a more successful arrangement than PADF's piece rate payment.  Both PADF and CARE are phasing out farmer incentive payments (interest is sufficent without them) and are either self-sufficient, or nearly so, in seedling production. Although the ODH SP has established a large-scale experimental tree nursery and produced an important seedling container system (winstrip), its seedling production output has lacked quality and reliability. Inadequate technical staff and flawed research methods (among other problems) have also hampered development of ODH's 7 large-scale tree farms and of its research component. Key recommendations are to continue the small-scale CARE/PADF approach to planting trees, with a review of ODH's large-scale concept and a possible scale-down of ODH funding.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Agroforestry|Reforestation|Cash crops|Land reclamation|Land improvement|Agricultural enterprises|Land use|Beneficiary count","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP220.pdf","3,104 KB","008554 - USAID.

"Evaluates research and extension component of an integrated agricultural development project in Haiti. Special evaluation covers the period 2/81-12/83 and is based primarily on interviews with Government of Haiti (GOH) officials. The project is too ambitious to attain all its goals and lack of timely action and especially of operating funds have delayed implementation despite efforts of the GOH Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Rural Development (DARNDR) to comply with project requirements.  Nonetheless, the TA team from the Texas A&M has made notable progress in identifying improved varieties of cereal, legume, and root crops (especially of corn, grain sorghum, field beans, sweet potato, and cassava), promoting intercropping, and developing technological packages for small farmers.  The Levy Research Station has not yet been fully developed, but not because of decisions by the TA team. Efforts to strengthen Haitian research capacity have been only partially successful due to the weakness of the existing research service structure, the GOH's slow response to the project agreements, a lack of funds, occasionally inadequate counterpart selection, the sending of counterparts for overseas training, and communication barriers. In other areas, helpful economic data have been collected and the training program is on track, although training aimed at establishing a research - extension link within DARNDR has been slighted and the need for training in farming systems research is now evident.  The latter, however, cannot be accomplished by this project. Also, the allied vertebrate pest control project had identified at least 8 pests responsible for damage to 13 major crops and has developed DARNDR's capability to develop pest control programs. To complete the project, the TA team must still complete current experiments, write up the technical packages, and multiply the elected seed materials, complete the analysis of baseline data and analyze the impact of the new technology, and arrange to transfer the project to DARNDR.  The major recommendation is to extend the TA contract for at least 9 months.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Varietal research|Agricultural extension|Food crops|Agricultural technology|Agricultural training|Institution building|Limited data plus","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP223.pdf","1,954 KB","008554 - USAID.

"Evaluates Project 4930314, to strengthen the Royal Thai Government's (RTG) ability to collect and use remote sensing Landsat data, and Project 4980253, to establish the Asian Regional Remote Sensing Training Center (ARRSTC) at the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT).  Special evaluation covers the period 7/79-5/83 and is based on extensive personnel interviews. Remote sensing technology generated under Project 4930314 is, for the most part, being used effectively in Thailand for resource assessment and planning and operation of the RTG National Research Council's (NRC) remote sensing unit is technically sophisticated.  However, the unit suffers from production backlogs and uncertainties about future U.S. actions with respect to Landsat and similar satellites, while technology adoption has been limited due to equipment shortages - many RTG user agencies lack simple analysis equipment, and the majority lack the interactive digital analysis equipment needed to obtain detail in remote sensing data.  The major RTG objective to obtain useful crop measurement and forecasting data has not been achieved, due partly to cloud cover and partly to a lack of technical development (e.g., in use of area frame sampling techniques). Some other potential remote sensing applications also appear underutilized. The ARRSTC was delayed in implementation; only two classes have graduated and the outreach activities have only just gotten underway. ARRSTC's educational program is sound, but it fails to address wide differences in student preparation, background, and interests, it is not yet integrated into the AIT's academic program, and it is hampered by organization into a single large class.  The IBM software (DIMAPS) at AIT has inadequate resolving power to teach digital analysis.  The training program also lacks suitable aerial photographs and appropriately scaled maps. It is recommended that A.I.D. continue remote sensing support and that future high technology projects (1) allow more flexibility for mid-course corrections; (2) examine logframe assumptions closely; (3) pay close attention to institutional and management aspects; (4) arrange to minimize costs due to short-term lapses between equipment generations; and (5) address the equipment needs of all user agencies.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-01-2084-00","","6/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Remote sensing|Institution building|Training centers|Technology transfer|Technical training|High technology|Electronic equipment|Natural resource management|Technological forecasting","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP236.pdf","4,376 KB","001037 - Resources Development Associates International, Inc.","","008613 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the decentralized provision of basic services in needy communities of Alexandria and Cairo, Egypt.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/83-3/84 and is based on document review and interviews with project staff and local participants. Due largely to capable TA, project implementation has largely been effective.  The district subproject (SP) component is well ahead of target with district officials and People's Council members actively participating; the overall quality of district SP's, both structurally and in terms of meeting needs, is adequate to good.  PVO SP's are also proceeding well, although there is some uncertainty as to how many and what kind of PVO's are to be assisted.  Training efforts have focused on orienting district and PVO officials to project procedures and on community training in waste removal, but this component has lacked the staff and funding levels needed to develop local organizational skills. Overemphasis on the rapid initiation of SP's (in response to both U.S. and Egyptian pressures) has put a strain on the TA team; moreover, if this rate of implementation continues, SP funds will be exhausted long before the project completion date.  Also, some SP funds have also been diverted by the special funds established subsequent to the project paper; while the special equipment and equipment maintenance funds clearly support project aims, the emergencies, paving, and solid waste funds prioritize governorate, rather than district, needs.  Delays in GOE funding of personnel incentives and maintenance have caused morale problems among district officials and early deterioration of some of the first SP's. However, the project's major problem is its lack of a clear definition of decentralized capacity, and of a plan on how to achieve it.  The result is an institution building strategy that is random rather than planned.  While the project has promoted decentralization by leaving decisions to district (and to a lesser degree PVO) officials, these officials see the project primarily as a source of badly needed funding and have little appreciation of its planned focus on strengthening local organizations. Several recommendations, focusing on the project's need for clarity in its goals and implementation plans, are made.","Attached to PD-AAP-243","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Public services|Communities|Urban areas|Management development|Decentralization|Local level|Districts|Private voluntary organizations|Community services|Beneficiary interviews","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP243A.pdf","4,502 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Presents final contractor evaluation of a 9/79-9/82 project to further human rights (HR) in Asian countries. A total of 66 grants were made, 33 to support 28 projects of institutions, 33 to support libraries and travel by individuals. Overall, the grants helped thousands appreciate their human and civil rights and laid the basis for expanding HR concepts and practices. Specifically, objectives were met by wide-ranging activities in the five target areas.  (1) The poor received legal aid via outreach programs of the Bangladesh Society for the Enforcement of HR and the Women Lawyer's Association of the Philippines, legal aid seminars at Chulalonghorn University, and distribution by the Seoul Judicial Scriveners Association of a Legal Aid Guide for Lay People.  (2) Women's rights were promoted, especially by the Women's Legal Aid Seminar in the Philippines and the Thai Women Lawyer's Association's program. (3) To a limited extent, the administration of justice was made more humane through various types of cooperative action programs - in Korea, a movement to install a modern probation system was begun and freedom of the press discussed; information linkages on crime and violence was increased in Thailand; and assistance was provided in the Philippines to detained prisoners and to class action-type cases. (4) HR outreach via legal literacy and clinical education programs was extended by universities in Papua, New Guinea, the Philippine, Thailand, and Malaysia and by a research project in Thailand.  (5) Asian participation in regional and international HR activities was realized via project-funded seminars, internships, study tours, and visiting U.S. consultants.  Limited success or failure of projects was attributed to insufficient planning, commitment, or leadership and at times to a changed political climate. The project taught:  the necessity of Asian initiative and commitment and of an established organizational base to program success; the value of small-sized incremental and integrated grants; and the need to respond quickly to and follow up on project opportunities.  Also, a stress on institutional development rather than on delivery programs might have resulted in longer-term benefits.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID/ASIA-G-1420","","11/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Human rights|Social justice|Equality before the law|Legal aid|Administration of law|Legal education|Legal reform|Universities and colleges|Women's rights","Korea R|Philippines|Malaysia|Thailand|Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAQ049.pdf","3,926 KB","000278 - The Asia Foundation (TAF)","","000036 - USAID.

"Evaluates the ability of the Fundacion de Credito Educativo (FCE) in the Dominican Republic to implement an off-shore scholarship program. Special evaluation, conducted in 3/83, is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with FCE staff, clients, and related personnel. FCE lacks the capacity to implement an off-shore scholarship program. FCE processes 1,000 student loans annually (using its own and third-party funds), the FCE credit division (responsible for making loans and collecting repayments) has developed a system to handle hundreds of inquiries and follow-up applications per month, and FCE staff are highly motivated.  However, FCE is not involved in scholarship programming (most staff at both the policy and operational levels could not distinguish between educational credit and scholarship services) and would have to overcome numerous problems to achieve this capacity.  FCE communication and decision/policy making processes do not encourage independent thinking (there is little lateral staff communication; staff meetings are infrequent; program decisons are made by FCE board, not by the executive secretary or staff).  FCE selection of loan recipients is based on a point scheme which homogenizes each candidate's characteristics, rather than on critical judgement; student monitoring is bureaucratic, rather than substantive.  FCE lacks the necessary physical and personnel resources to place students in overseas training programs (e.g., staff with English-language ability; direct access to students and U.S. institutions; information on study opportunities) or to help them find a job when they return.  Other constraints include: lack of long-term commitment to and of broad, ongoing, national support for such a program (and the resulting need for external financial aid); FCE's lack of a project development capacity; and a tendency to politicize FCE decisions. Recommendations are to:  not create an FCE off-shore scholarship program; train FCE staff to pre-screen candidates for other AID-sponsored programs; support FCE staff enrichment through visits to other Latin American educational credit organizations; and create an educational resource and counseling center in the Dominican Republic.","Attached to PD-AAP-143","Special Evaluation","Documents","83-AID-023","","5/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Scholarships|Student financial assistance|Educational finance","Dominican Republic","","","001378 - Latin American Scholarship Program of American Universities","","008537 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to support Seventh Day Adventist World Service's (SAWS) maternal/child feeding and other nutrition and health improvement activities in 10 target areas of Haiti. Special evaluation covers the period 6/81-11/83 and is based on site visits and interviews with SAWS and nutrition center personnel and with beneficiaries and community leaders. Compared with similar programs in Haiti, the SAWS program has been unusually successful in helping children achieve and maintain weight gains - it has saved a number of severely malnourished children from death and is even producing impressive weight gains in the difficult one-to-two-year-old group. Although the program is still too young to assess the durability of these improvements or the possibility of spread effects, attendance at follow-up weighing is quite good at 72%.  The food provided by SAWS is high in both nutritional and economic value, compared to other programs, but without creating excessive dependency and at a satisfactory cost-benefit ratio.  Program impact has varied among nutrition centers, and attendance is clearly correlated with nutritional improvement. In terms of quantitative outputs, the project is on target in establishing nutrition centers, ahead in training health workers and installing kitchen gardens, but behind in self-help projects (SAWS has serious doubts about proliferating skills for which there is little or no identified market) and in numbers of children completing the program and being weighed monthly. Nutrition/health education has been deficient, especially in priority areas, largely because of limitations in supervision (at the lower level) and in staff training (which tends to be unfocused, overly inclusive, and nonexperiental).  Clinic management and program evaluation are also weak. The overall success of the SAWS program can be ascribed to the PVO's flexibility, practical orientation, well-functioning logistic and financial systems, and the quality and commitment of its staff. Key recommendations are to:  (1) make growth surveillance the centerpiece of the program, and limit other activities to food supplementation, nutrition/health education, and a modest home gardening effort; and (2) provide SAWS with TA to improve its supervision, education (of staff and mothers), and evaluation capabilities.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Maternal child feeding programs|Private voluntary organizations|Child nutrition|Nutrition education|Health education|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP260.pdf","2,681 KB","002196 - Seventh Day Adventist World Service, Inc.","","000189 - USAID.

"Presents final report (as of 8/83) on two pilot Food for Work (FW) projects aimed at building roads and related structures in Bangladesh - a Local Government Pilot (LGP) project and a CARE project.  Report summarizes monthly reports conducted 4-8/83 and based on site visits and staff interviews (XD-AAP-265-A,B,C,D). Both projects exhibited professionalism and flexibility in handling a seemingly endless flow of problems.  The LGP project was managed at the Thana level, with Thana Technical Staff (TTS) providing engineering and primary support.  Slow provision of project documentation to the Thanas, however, together with serious logistical problems, pushed many activities into the monsoon season, so that as of the 6/10 deadline only 28 of 215 targeted roads were completed, with 24 in progress; work will continue next season.  Due to lack of time, many engineers used simpler and less costly designs than those in the recommended design manual. Construction was of good quality once evaluator's suggestions regarding building techniques and frequent supervision (often impeded by lack of transportation) were adopted.  It is noted that TTS supervisors failed to understand the placement of weepholes and proper excavataion procedures. The CARE program - with 19 schemes - operated mainly at the Union level, with the Thana responsible for design and oversight, and CARE providing overall technical guidance.  The use of innovative administrative procedures did not cause delays - all projects were completed to the slab casting stage by 6/10.  Contrary to standard practice, contractors received 25% advances for materials purchase, and all final payments were made prior to the final completion of work - practices that would have been risky if contractors had not come from within the Union.  The use of low-cost designs and construction methods and of contractors and local craftsmen, together with irregular supervision by the TTS's, resulted in structures that, while aesthetically less pleasing than in the LGP project, are adequate, although some may experience minor premature failures due to technical decision errors. Some 36 recommendations are made to improve follow-up FFW activities.","Attachments: XD-AAP-265-A through XD-AAP-265-D","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Food for work|Rural areas|Road construction|Bridge construction|Roads|Transportation system design|Limited data plus","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP265.pdf","16,388 KB","","","008511 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the capacity of the Centre Haitien de Recherches pour la Promotion Feminine (CHREPROF) to provide vocational training and income-generating opportunities to women in urban and rural Haiti.  Special evaluation covers the period 1979-11/82 and is based on site visits and interviews with CHREPROF personnel. Progress has been mixed.  CHREPROF's financial management has shown considerable improvement.  The organization has hired several new personnel and continously provides technical assistance to its 13 local branches.  Three 3-day regional seminars have been held to train branch managers and technicians in project design, analysis, and evaluation and three teaching manuals developed. An 88-bed women's dormitory was constructed in Miragoane as planned, but the construction is subpar in some regards and the facility has been underutilized; as yet no real training program is in operation there. Skills training at the other CHREPROF sites, however, has been quite successful.  Between 9/81-9/82, 1,712 persons took part in the program, which includes both vocational and basic education.  The life skills education program, on the other hand, is still at a rudimentary stage, with only limited offerings in hygiene and family planning.  Community development efforts at the branches have been poorly organized, understaffed, and comprised more of rhetoric than action. Small-scale income-generating activities are underway at all 13 branches, consisting mostly of selling products made in cooking or sewing classes or conducting social events for profit.  Most activities have been too small to yield sufficient resources to help branches become more self-sufficient (a few activities lost money) and proper financial records have not been kept.  Two branches have sponsored larger activities which have had better success.  CHREPROF also operates two small loan programs (funded by other donors) which benefit individual members or groups directly.  Finally, a placement service for branch graduates has placed some 40 persons per month, most, however, in domestic or secretarial work. Eleven major and eight minor recommendations address the deficiencies noted above.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Institution building|Small scale enterprises|Community development|Basic education|Vocational training","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP266.pdf","2,213 KB","008554 - USAID.

"Evaluates 18 bean and cowpea Collaborative Research Support Projects (CRSP).  The special evaluations were conducted 8/83-12/83 and are based on document review, indepth interviews, and site visits. Of the 18 projects - 12 on beans and 6 on cowpeas - 9 were rated satisfactory for continuation without major changes or adjustments. Five were judged satisfactory for continuation with a recommendation for identified changes or adjustments.  Four were deemed less than satisfactory for continuation unless major deficiencies and weaknesses are corrected. Despite the sizeable number of domestic and foreign institutions distributed in North, Central and South America (including the Caribbean) and in East, West and Southern Africa, the CRSP Management Office (MO), Board of Directors, Technical Committee, and 9 U.S. universities and 1 research institute have been able to provide satisfactory administrative and technical management for the 13 countries with CRSP projects.  This is particularly significant because it has been during a period of high personnel turnover in the MO.  There are several exceptions, but operations of the CRSP projects overall have been carried out quite well. Given the number of projects and the diversity of activities and personalities in a cross-cultural, intergovernmental relationship, this is a surprising achievement worthy of special recognition. As a unique, new member of the international agricultural research and development system, this CRSP arrangement shows considerable promise.  It is a highly acceptable and effective method for bringing extensive U.S. knowledge to support food and agricultural development in low-income, food-deficient nations. In the short-term, predictable benefits can accrue from the transfer and/or development of knowledge and materials under the CRSP arrangement.  Clearly, this process is underway in the bean/cowpea CRSP and the direct benefits surely will exceed the costs.  For the long term, the benefits are likely to be more rewarding: the CRSP builds institutional, personal, and professional relationships which will endure long after its demise. Such relationships will continue to pay dividends, given the dynamic nature of agriculture and the need to draw continually on expertise wherever it exists.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSAN-XII-G-0261","","7/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Research collaboration|Agricultural research|Cowpeas|Agricultural development","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAQ174.pdf","990 KB","003738 - Michigan State University.

"Evaluates project to establish a national development foundation (NDF) to provide technical/financial assistance to marginal small businesses in Jamaica.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/81-9/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with staff of the NDF, USAID/J, and the Pan American Development Foundation (the grantee), and with NDF clients. The project has been exceptionally well implemented; most targets have been met or exceeded.  Over 180 loans have been made to marginal small-scale entrepreneurs (SSE's).  Preliminary data from a PCV's study shows that of 145 loans made by 7/83, over 50% were to groceries or garment-making shops and over 33% were to women; 168 jobs were created. Loan default has been about 5%; there have been 6 repossessions, with one reinstatement when NDF conditions were met.  NDF field extension officers (FEO's) have also provided business advice and training to SSE's in bookkeeping and other areas. Most organizational goals have also been met.  The well-attended, 15-member NDF board, composed of a cross-section of the private sector, has worked well with NDF management through three committees - loans, finance/audit, and public relations and promotion.  Both the quality of staff recruited and their training (some in-house, although most provided by Partnership for Productivity) have been excellent.  There has been little turn-over among the 17 staff members (including FEO's, an executive director, and a financial controller) and 2 PCV's. Public and private support have been good, and fundraising and membership drives successful. Project effectiveness has been hampered by the lack of systematic sectoral planning by board/management; by too many duties and too heavy a case load for FEO's; and by the lack of mid-management support.  Also, NDF fundraising is lagging behind budgeted targets - a potential problem for the future. Key recommendations are to:  conduct annual planning exercises; redefine financial/development functions and decrease FEO duties; hire two mid-managers; and renew fundraising efforts.  USAID/J has extended NDF funding with a second OPG.","Attached to PD-AAP-327","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Development organizations|Foundations|National level|Private sector|Small scale enterprises|Entrepreneurs|Institution building|Management training|Commercial credit|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Jamaica","","","000933 - Yale University.

"Evaluates project to strengthen Jamaica's institutional capacity to plan and manage energy programs, especially those concerned with energy conservation (EC) and alternative energy (AE). Special evaluation covers the period 9/81-4/83 and is based on document review and interviews with project personnel. Although much progress has been made since the initial 8-month delay, several problems exist which could hinder project success, Neither the Ministry of Mining and Energy's (MME) Energy Division (ED) nor its Project Implementation Unit (PIU) are fully staffed due to low wage scales (63% below that of the private sector) and lack of career opportunities - factors leading to a high staff turnover, confused lines of authority, and low morale.  Other problems include, iner alia, the need to enhance ED's organizational status (by making it a department), define its policy function, improve its training program, and hire middle managers.  Formation of energy policy is being hampered by the lack of analytical expertise in ED's Energy Planning Branch, the high level of friction between the ED and other energy-related GOJ entities, ED's lack of status, and failure to prioritize the project's EC and AE components.  Also, of the three long-term advisors, the energy generalist does not appear qualified and the AE advisor is not yet in place. Despite these and other problems, EC efforts have progressed well, although energy audits should include financial analysis in order to ensure the economic viability of potential EC investments.  Also, despite problems caused by the continuing tax on solar water heating, the AE program has made good progress in creating a demonstration center and a solar energy institute, assessing indigenous energy resources, installing public solar water facilities, developing standards, and initiating training and a forestry program.","Attached to PD-AAP-334","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Management development|Energy policy|Energy conservation|Alternative energy resources|Personnel management","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP334A.pdf","704 KB","008563 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve Jamaica's agricultural marketing infrastructure.  Mid-term external evaluation covers the period 1/81-11/83 and is based on site visits and interviews with project and other concerned personnel, farmers, and officials from local Producer Marketing Organizations (PMO's). In spite of early setbacks (e.g., the need to replace the original TA team), Phase I, aimed at strengthening marketing awareness in the MOA, was well designed and has achieved a fairly high level of success.  The most marked achievement has been the development of a capably (though not fully) staffed MOA marketing division, with information, research, training, extension, and quality assurance subdivisions; of these, the market news unit has been most successful, collecting prices 3 times a week on over 20 commodities from 2 national and 4 regional markets.  The understaffed research unit is, however, saddled with a heavy workload, i.e., conducting feasibility studies for all PMO's, and the training function remains ill-defined; short courses are being developed, but, due to staff shortages, there is a (perhaps short-sighted) reluctance to undertake long-term training. Extension, i.e., organizing PMO's, started slowly, has come on strongly in recent months, but is still experiencing difficulties even though receiving assistance from PCV's and two U.S. PVO's (5 PMO's have been formed to date); a separate grant has been made to assist in PMO organization and training.  Finally, the quality assurance unit is making good progress in setting grades and standards for root crops. Progress during Phase II, aimed at constructing assembly and grading stations (AG's) and subterminal wholesale distribution markets (SWDM's) - while continuing to organize the PMO's, who will be responsible for managing the AG's - has been more modest. The target of 25 large AG's and 4 large SWDM's is excessive, and should be modified in size and/or number. Although the project has not yet had much impact on farmers, traders, or consumers, the potential impacts are nevertheless important.  It is recommended that the project be extended 3-5 years and that all efforts be concentrated at six, fairly advanced, pilot sites.  Several other recommendations are also made.","Attached to PD-AAP-335|Loan number 532-T-013A|Evaluation period: 2-22 Nov 1983","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural product marketing|Agricultural cooperatives|Institution building|Government departments|Beneficiary interviews","Jamaica","","","008563 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to expand and improve delivery of family planning (FP) services in Jamaica.  Special evaluation covers the period 3/82-8/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with USAID/J, Government of Jamaica (GOJ), National Family Planning Board (NFPB), and other project staff. Despite a 6-month implementation delay, the project has achieved some success.  Already 352 of a planned 370 Ministry of Health (MOH) clinics are offering FP services (although 53% are staffed by only a midwife and community health worker and have limited facilities) and sterilizations have increased 26%.  With 1,830 new retail outlets, commercial contraceptive sales have increased 34% (vs. a targeted 25% by 1985) and a market survey is planned. An inter-agency population policy coordinating committee has been established and the National Population Policy has been prepared and presented to the GOJ parliament.  Research into determinants of fertility, migration, and contraceptive prevalence is underway at the University of the West Indies (UWI) Department of Sociology and the National Planning Agency (the latter has acquired an additional staff member, a vehicle, and equipment). The population diploma course at UWI is set to begin in 10/83. Although 2 NFPB personnel have begun overseas training (4 are set to go after 4/83) and some in-country courses have been held (i.e., a 3-day management seminar for NFPB and other project staff; 4 NFPB inservice programs for 84; a seminar for 14 private doctors; and a male motivation seminar for 42), the MOH training plan has not yet been approved and no MOH staff have yet received AID-funded primary health care training (vs. a planned 2,000). The crude birth rate has not decreased and contraceptive acceptors have increased overall by only 3%.  Nonclinical outreach is set to begin soon, however it is unlikely that the targeted 50% increase in acceptors can be achieved.  The project has also been hampered by:  delayed arrival of contraceptive supplies (other supplies including 8 of 10 vehicles arrived on time) and inadequate communication about supply shortages; failure to fill all NFPB staff positions; and GOJ economic difficulties. Recommendations are included.","Attached to PD-AAP-336|Evaluation period: 22 Aug-9 Sep 1983","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Family planning clinics|Clinic-based contraceptive distribution|Community based delivery|Contraceptive distribution|Commercial retail sale of contraceptives|Contraceptive prevalence|Family planning education|Family planning policy|Family planning promotion programs","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP336A.pdf","4,069 KB","008563 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve and expand rural primary health care services in Guyana.  Special evaluation covers the period 1979-4/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with USAID/G, contractor, and Ministry of Health (MOH) and other Government of Guyana personnel. Despite Guyana's severe economic crisis, substantial project progress has been achieved.  Following high-quality, 15-month courses taught by tutor/supervisors (T/S's) at the Medex Training Unit (MTU), 105 medexes (mid-level health workers) have been deployed at rural health centers throughout Guyana.  The T/S's, who have received teacher training through a number of short-term in-country and U.S. courses, also supervise graduates and provide continuing education through periodic visits to the centers.  A two-way radio communication network - connecting ten health centers and the MTU - has been set up and is functioning well; an additional 23 two-way units are awaiting installation.  However, due to radio interference, the system - which is used to transmit administrative, medical, and emergency messages and a weekly teaching conference - is not linked to MOH headquarters; this lack of communication has limited coordination between the project and the MOH.  Other project accomplishments include the publishing an MTU newsletter containing administrative and clinical information and self-assessment quizzes for medexes and the establishment of an improved MOH financial management information system for the central and regional levels. Although most of the components of an improved supply system (for drugs, etc.) have been implemented, supply problems continue due primarily to a foreign exchange shortage.  Other problems have included: an acute housing shortage for rural medexes (no construction or contracts have been completed); major transportation difficulties due to a severe shortage of vehicles and maintenance personnel; the loss of trained personnel, especially in management, due to migration; and overburdened T/S's resulting in inadequate medex supervision. Recommendations are included.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Rural areas|Paramedical education|Health outreach services|Clinics","Guyana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP340.pdf","2,219 KB","001318 - American Public Health Association.

"Evaluates project to provide health and sanitation services in marginal urban slum areas (tugurios) in El Salvador and child nutrition services in rural areas.  Special evaluation covers the period 1980-5/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with Salvadorean officials. The project has been relatively successful in urban areas, where regular health services are being provided to some 107,000 people in 83 of 150 targeted tugurios; 35 tugurios are served by their own clinics, 44 by clinics in a nearby tugurio, and 4 served only by sanitation workers.  Although 121,143 health consultations have been held, their overall value has been limited because they are available only 2 half-days a week and because of the proximity of other services.  More than 60,000 contraceptive packages have been distributed and nearly 9,000 health education presentations made.  Community involvement has been very strong in sanitation activities - the elimination of mosquito breeding sites, community cleanup, and the installation of water sources and, in some cases, latrines. Rural activities have been hampered by politically motivated, overcentralized planning; poor community organization; and deficient ministerial support as well as by seasonal migrations and political disturbances which have limited operations in some regions.  Although 25 nutrition centers (vs. an amended target of 70) opened between 12/81-4/82 (18 months behind schedule), only 9 are still operating.  The centers have provided day care and supplementary food, but very little nutrition surveillance or mother education; coverage of target populations has been less than 20%.  Distribution of P.L. 480 Title II commodities has been irregular and the nutritional status of children has improved only minimally. High turnover among volunteer personnel has been a major problem in both components.  Replacement training, continuing education, and a management information system are badly needed. Despite its problems, the project has good potential and should not be curtailed because of current political disturbances.  Key needs are to focus on community organization and to provide Regional Health Offices with the resources and authority to respond flexibly to changing needs.  Several recommendations are made.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Maternal child feeding programs|Clinics|Community participation|Urban areas|Rural areas|Sanitation|Community health care|Beneficiary count|Public data","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP341.pdf","1,589 KB","001318 - American Public Health Association.

"Evaluates project to establish an Early Warning Information and Intervention System (EWIIS) to detect and prevent food crises in Indonesia.  Special evaluation covers Phase II activities to 4/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with research personnel and with provincial, village, and sub-village officials. Good progress has been made in implementing EWIIS at the central, provincial, but most of all the local Kabupaten levels, where adequate government personnel are available for the project and where officials have adapted EWIIS to local needs.  In particular, testing of EWIIS in the designated pilot area of Lombok Tengah, as recommended in last year's evaluation, has been successful, and the system is able to operate without external help - which bodes well for its long-term viability and replicability.  A good 1982 harvest precluded system testing, but a food consumption survey helped identify the chronically malnourished, and there is strong interest at all levels in collecting nutrition data for the purpose of long-term planning. The existing EWIIS system in Boyolali, for example, recently inaugurated a household consumption survey (and also implemented a formalized data collection/analysis process). The Center for Research and Development in Nutrition (CRDN) has prepared manuals to facilitate EWIIS transfer to other kabupatens (an effort which CRDN, with TA from Cornell University, is ready to support), the provision of TA by local universities in implementing EWIIS is about to be tested in Central Lombok, and plans for the Central Government to participate in the system and to use locally generated data are being pursued in Bappenas and Menko Kesra.  No progress has been made, however, in fulfilling previous recommendations to conduct operational research aimed at evaluating the efficacy of various interventions in food crisis situations and at determining when the crisis is past. Specific recommendations are to implement operational research; expand EWIIS into a comprehensive nutritional surveillance system; conduct a review workshop at the project's end; and institutionalize EWIIS with post-project USAID/I support.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Nutrition surveillance|Food shortages|Warning systems|Institution building|Local level","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP347.pdf","3,603 KB","","","008558 - USAID.

The project purpose will not be fully achieved, for ACOSCA is undergoing severe retrenchment and today barely exists as an organization.  In a drastic (but necessary) move, staffing is being reduced from 31 to 16, and 3 regional offices and 2 central departments are being abolished.  While ACOSCA itself is responsible for its problems, the situation has been worsened by a serious lack of donor coordination.  A.I.D., as the major donor - the World Council of Credit Unions is the other - should have required prompt remedial action. ACOSCA is completely dependent on donor assistance and will likely continue to be for 20 years or more. Nonetheless, ACOSCA will reap significant gains in training, in organizational development, and in risk management (the latter is relatively independent of the A.I.D. project per se).  ACOSCA's training program - its most successful activity - gives trainees the practical experience needed to provide training programs for credit union officers in their own countries.  Each trainee, for example, prepares an accounting manual, many of which have been formally adopted in their countries.  Moreover, training is being successfully institutionalized within ACOSCA and by mid-1984 will require only financial support and minimal TA. Regarding organizational development, a job task analysis has been completed, job descriptions prepared, procedural manuals developed and utilized, a salary and benefit committee and a performance appraisal system established, and a modern accounting system installed. The project should continue to completion, essentially as planned, with training given absolute priority; donor coordination should be ensured; and any follow-on project should focus on institution building, require ACOSCA to function as an entity, and recognize that ACOSCA will not be self-sufficient within 5 or 10 years.","Attached to PD-AAP-374","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Associations|Institution building|Credit unions|Technical training|Beneficiary interviews","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP374A.pdf","772 KB","000226 - Action Programs International","","000013 - USAID.

"Evaluates Combatting Childhood Communicable Diseases (CCCD) project in Sub-Saharan Africa.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/81-6/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project, host-country, other-donor, and Mission personnel. The project, soundly conceived and well received by African governments, has the potential to make a major contribution to the reduction of child mortality.  Nineteen countries have requested CCCD assessments; 10 have been completed (and projects in these countries already approved or started), 4 are in progress, and 5 at the request stage; assessments have been of high-quality in both content and format. The CCCD projects focus on integrating vaccination, oral rehydration therapy (ORT), and presumptive chloroquine treatment (CT) with primary health care (PHC).  CCCD's bilateral approach has proven sound; generally, A.I.D. (the major donor) has funded mainly technical, planning, and operational support, and other donors equipment, supplies, and training.  An improved management information system has been devised and will soon be field-tested. The Zaire project, despite the personnel and financial problems seen in all CCCD projects, is a fine example of integrating CCCD into PHC. About 25% of the population has access to vaccination; ORT and CT will soon be added.  Excellent training modules have been developed and zonal medical chiefs (ZMC's) are being trained to implement CCCD activities. However, lack of senior CCCD staff has left supervision of ZMC's inadequate.  The project needs to redefine its overly ambitious objectives (also typical of CCCD projects) and to develop linkages with research institutions as well as techniques to measure morbidity/mortality rates. Other problems confronting CCCD as a whole are:  lack of participation by major African countries (e.g., Nigeria, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Kenya); restrictions on financing CCCD projects in Sahelian countries; and less international coordination and multidonor support than expected (Zaire being a notable exception). Among numerous recommendations made, the most critical are to develop senior African management staff and to resolve the problem of recurrent costs.  Detailed suggestions are also made for implementing intercountry activities in concert with WHO/AFRO.","Attached to PD-AAP-375|Project title: Africa child survival initiative-Combatting|childhood communicable diseases (ACSI-CCCD)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Child health care|Communicable diseases|Disease prevention and control|Primary health care|Public health care|Preventive health care|Child mortality","Sahel|Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP375A.pdf","688 KB","000013 - USAID.

"Evaluates Catholic Relief Service's Food For Work (FFW) program in India's Calcutta zone.  Impact evaluation, focusing on recipient characteristics, eater characteristics, and nutritional status, covers FFW projects implemented during FY 1980; it is based on interviews with a random sample of 322 beneficiaries (30.5% still active in FFW activities). Key findings are:  (1) Socioeconomic characteristics - About 67% of recipients were nonagricultural laborers, 84% were illiterate, and 94% lacked formal education; 84% belonged to scheduled castes or tribes and 11% to backward classes.  Very few owned land and few had a monthly income above Rs.300. (2) Eater characteristics - 95% of recipients shared FFW commodities with their families - 39% shared with their wives, 49% with their children, and the remainder with other relatives - while the other 5% consumed the commodities themselves.  Some 62% consumed the food received as FFW wages in less than one week. (3) Recipient families' nutritional status - 73% of recipient families were above the minimum calorie consumption norm for their geographic area and 82% were above the norm for protein intake. Nonactive recipients were superior to active recipients in both protein and calorie intake. (4) Children's nutritional status - According to American standards the extent of malnutrition is generally very severe and relatively greater among children of nonactive recipients than among children of active recipients.  By Indian norms, when analyzed according to a weight-for-age index, 16% of active recipient children were normal and 39% mildly malnourished; the corresponding percentages for nonactive families were 26% and 46%.  By weight-for-height index, the percentage of normal children was greater among nonactive recipients, while by height-for-age index, children belonging to active families showed higher nutritional status. (5) Other - 80% of recipients were willing to work on FFW even if they received no direct benefits from the completed projects; the average employment provided was 96 days a year.  About 70% knew the commodities came from America.","Cover date: January 1983","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Work|Socioeconomic status|Food consumption patterns|Human nutrition|Child nutrition|Nutritional status|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP355.pdf","1,546 KB","003753 - Lalit Narayan Mishra Institute of Economic Development and Social Change","","008557 - USAID.

"Evaluates Food for Work (FFW) project implemented by Catholic Relief Services (CRS) in two areas (Ranchi and Chandwa) of India's Calcutta Zone (South Bihar).  Impact evaluation is based on interviews with a sample of 979 FFW recipients, 395 of whom were currently working on FFW projects. The majority (98%) of recipients were male, 95% were under age 50, 76% were illiterate, and 80% were married; 50% were Hindu, 36% Christian, 2% Muslim, and 12% other.  Nearly all owned their own homes but none had electricity or indoor water or sanitation facilities.  Most were small or marginal farmers or agricultural laborers with monthly household incomes of Rs. 101/- to Rs. 300/-. Recipients averaged 68 days of work per year on FFW projects. Most had been unemployed before the projects and worked on them because they provided assured employment.  Most received their payments of bulgar and/or corn and oil in person and shared them with their families. Among them they had 1,978 children under age 15.  FFW food lasted 1-2 weeks for 56% of the families but less than a week for 38%.  About half of the recipients stored the commodities. On average, active recipients consumed more calories and more protein than did nonactive ones.  Protein and calorie intake was normal for some 75-84% of recipients (active and nonactive). Income, caste, and type of farmer (e.g., small or marginal) did not significantly affect these intakes.  Indian and American measures differ on the extent of child malnutrition.  Both show the nutritional status of children of nonactive recipients, particularly boys, to be higher than that of active recipients. However, Indian standard measures of combined height/weight/age show a higher percentage of normal children in nonactive recipient families, while American standards show a higher number of normal children among active recipient families. Over half of the recipients felt they would not benefit directly from FFW construction, but would nevertheless work on the projects.  Although average incomes rose by 14%, few increased their assets with FFW income.","Cover date: January 1983","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Food for work|Child nutrition|Nutritional status|Human nutrition|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP356.pdf","2,691 KB","003754 - Xavier Institute of Social Services","","008557 - USAID.

"Evaluates Food for Work (FFW) projects to level land at 610 sites in India's Bombay Zone.  Ex post impact evaluation covers FFW projects implemented during FY78-FY80 and is based on interviews with a sample of 365 beneficiaries and 72 nonbeneficiaries. The average size of land leveled was around one acre.  Most beneficiaries were married men aged 31 to 50, illiterate, Hindu, from backward or scheduled castes or tribes, and with monthly incomes of 500 rupees or less.  Up to 99% owned their homes but few had indoor plumbing or electricity. As a result of the project, average beneficiary household income increased 54% in FY78, 74% in FY79, and 70% in FY80.  Compared to nonbeneficiaries, however, beneficiary incomes increased by 80% in FY78, 70% in FY79, and 99% in FY80.  Land leveling enabled beneficiary families to cultivate their own land more intensively, resulting in average employment increases per family of 7% in FY78 and FY79 and 3% in FY80.  Off-farm income also showed modest increases, but the importance of agricultural labor on other farms as a source of employment declined. Use of hired labor by beneficiaries increased. Land leveling also helped to increase irrigation, especially during Rabi season.  Total area cropped and yield per beneficiary increased during both Kharif and Rabi.  During Kharif, yield increases were 42%, 52%, 83% respectively during FY78, FY79, and FY80, while during Rabi the corresponding increases were 500%, 300%, and 200%.  Both paddy and wheat (the two most important crops) showed yield increases.  These improvements in yield per beneficiary were due in part to increases in cropped area, and in part to improvements in yield per acre. Comparison of beneficiaries and nonbeneficiaries showed that total cropped area, crop yield per acre, and the value of output per acre were all higher for beneficiaries.  Gross returns per beneficiary rose by 87% in FY78, 82% in FY79, and 131% in FY80 (due in part to price increases). Percentage of beneficiaries aware of the U.S. provenance of FFW commodities increased from 16% in FY78 to 32% in FY80.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Food for work|Land leveling|Cultivated land|Crop yield|Agricultural productivity|Farm income|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP357.pdf","2,298 KB","003755 - Centre for Research, Planning and Action","","008557 - USAID.

"Evaluates P.L. 480 Title II Food for Work (FFW) project implemented by Catholic Relief Services (CRS) in five areas of Bombay, India. Impact evaluation covers FY80 and is based on a survey of recipients. A stratified two-stage sampling procedure was used.  For each of 33 FFW projects studied, two sampling units (villages or village clusters, and individual recipients) were selected on the basis of equal probability sampling without replacement.  The 4 ongoing and 29 completed FFW projects studied included road construction, land-leveling, and low-cost housing.  Interviews were conducted at recipients' homes by experienced data collectors.  A total of 644 recipients were selected for interview, of whom 11.8% were active (actually working on FFW projects and eating FFW commodities).  Inactive recipients had previously worked on FFW projects. The following conclusions were drawn as to the nutritional status of recipient families and their children aged 1-5:  44% of active recipient households and 38% of the inactive families were above the minimum required calorie norm, with the former having a significantly higher calorie intake; 84% of active families and 81% of inactive had a protein intake above the required minimum, with significantly higher protein intake among active families. No significant intake differences were observed among castes, tribes, different classes of farmers, or income categories.  In inactive families, 9% of the children were of normal weight by Indian norms and 67% suffered mild malnutrition; the corresponding ratios for active families were 3% and 72% respectively. Girls were better nourished than boys.  Combined height for age and weight for height indices show that by Indian standards 75% of nonactive families' children and 85% of active families' children were normal; by U.S. standards, only 47% and 67% of nonactive and active families' children respectively were normal; 28-43% suffered second-to-third-degree malnutrition. Survey data are also provided on recipients' socioeconomic and demographic characteristics; the organizational framework of FFW; eater characteristics (consumption and storage of FFW commodities); the impact of the FFW on employment and income; and recipients' expectations regarding FFW projects.","Cover date: January 1983","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Work|Socioeconomic status|Human nutrition|Child nutrition|Nutritional status|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP358.pdf","3,216 KB","003755 - Centre for Research, Planning and Action","","008557 - USAID.

"Evaluates a P.L. 480, Title II Food for Work (FFW) program in India's Cochin Zone.  Impact evaluation covers the period 2/80-1/83 and presents results of a sample survey of 337 recipients - 258 of them currently active - in 19 FFW projects such as vocational training and the construction of roads, schools, tanks, dams, and low-cost housing. Of the recipients surveyed, 72% were male and 83% were between 21 and 50 years of age, 64% between 21-40.  By landholding category, 87% were marginal farmers.  By occupation, however, 31% were in agricultural and 37% in nonagricultural labor; only 5% regarded agriculture as their main occupation.  Unemployment appears to have been the main motive for working on FFW project. Most (70%) acknowledged payment of their wages on time, and of the 66% of the recipients who provided consumption information, 60% shared the commodities with family members.  On average, employment from FFW contributed 39% of the total employment of each recipient. However, increases in income were modest - only Rs. 33. Active recipients generally had a lower level per capita of calorie consumption, but a higher level of protein consumption than inactive (prior) recipients.  Calorie/protein consumption did not vary notably with caste, income, or size of land-holding. In a weight-for-age analysis by Indian standards, 78% of the children of active recipients were normal and 22% mildly malnourished against respective figures of 34% and 42% for children of inactive recipients, with girls having a better nutritional status than boys; by the American norm, however, malnutrition was high regardless of these differences. Height-for-age analysis by Indian standards showed that children of both active and inactive workers were near normal, with boys showing a relatively higher status than girls; again, however, by American norms malnutrition was severe among all children, but relatively higher among girls and among children belonging to inactive families.  Finally, by both Indian and American norms, the weight-for-height and the combined height-for-age and weight-for-height indexes showed extensive and at times severe malnutrition.","Cover date: January 1983","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Child nutrition|Food for work|Nutritional status|Beneficiary count|Sampling method","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP359.pdf","2,893 KB","003756 - Rajagiri College of Social Sciences.

"Evaluates P.L. 480, Food For Work (FFW) project aimed at excavating irrigation wells in India's Madras Zone.  Special evaluation presents results of two sample surveys of project beneficiaries (mostly marginal farmers) - a survey of 73 beneficiaries in l9 of 95 FFW projects in 1978 and a survey of 235 beneficiaries in 37 of 2l6 projects in 1981, all in Tamil Nadu.  A group of 45 nonbeneficiaries with similar socioeconomic characteristics were used as a control group. In most cases, wells were deepened because other irrigation sources were lacking; beneficiaries almost unanimously affirmed the threat of drought in the area.  Most work was done on a self-help basis; in both years, 80% of the beneficiaries used their own funds for excavating wells (10% borrowed money in 1981, double the 1978 figure) and consultation with development authorities was infrequent.  A total of 72% in 1978 and 64% in 1981 expressed satisfaction with the wells.  The importance of the FFW program was evident:  94% of beneficiaries in 1978 and 90% in 1981 affirmed they would not have deepened their wells without FFW assistance. As a result of increases in both years in cropped and irrigated areas, output per beneficiary rose 70% in 1978 and 33% in 1981 and led to corresponding increases in employment and income levels among beneficiaries.  Employment was up 21% (93 person-days) in 1978 and 17% (67 person-days) in 1981 and reached levels higher than for nonbeneficiaries.  Beneficiaries income - most of it from agriculture and allied activities - was up 39% in 1978 and 31% (748 Rs.) in 1981; the agricultural income of beneficiaries was greater than that of nonbeneficiaries. Further, the average cost per acre of land brought under irrigation (in terms of bulgar units) was estimated at 2,159 kg in 1978 and 3,906 kg in 1981 and the pay-back period was calculated at 2.33 years for 1978 projects, 4.25 years for 1981 projects.  These results suggest that a 2-3 year period may be needed to ensure maximal use of the increased irrigation potential of deepened wells.","Cover date: January 1983","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Food for work|Dug wells|Irrigation|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP360.pdf","3,218 KB","003755 - Centre for Research, Planning and Action","","008557 - USAID.

"Evaluates a P.L. 480 Title II Food for Work (FFW) program in Madras, India.  Impact evaluation covers the period 6/81-6/82 and is based a sample survey of 367 food recipients in 37 projects for a total of 18 consignee-activity combinations (CAC's) - all in Tamil Nadu.  By activity, those interviewed were involved in well-deepening (122); building tanks (55), roads (49), and low-cost housing (92); land-leveling (20); and vocational training (29).  Those still active in FFW projects numbered 66. Daily, weekly, and fortnightly payments averaged, respectively, 3.6 kg, 21.6, and 45 kg of bulgar and 125, 750, and 1,750 grams of oil. Some 95% of all recipients shared their food with their families, half of the time with children aged 1-14.  Little difference was found in nutritional intake between active recipient families and inactive recipient families (57% and 54% above minimum, respectively); as usual, protein deficiency was lower than calorie deficiency (76% and 72% of active and inactive families, respectively, were above the norm for protein intake). Calorie/protein intake did not differ notably among castes or according to the size of land holdings, but did tend to rise with increased income.  Analyzed by Indian weight-for-age norms, the nutritional status of the children in active and inactive families did not notably differ:  nutritional normalcy was found in 20% and 26% and mild malnutrition in 51% and 54% of the two groups respectively.  Sex differences were not significant. Similar results were found when children were analyzed by the Indian height-for-age index and by American norms. FFW projects provided 63 person-days of employment a year and 34 days to two other members of the family.  Person-days in non-FFW work for recipients and their families totaled, respectively, 157 and 240.  FFW was responsible for 37% of the increase from 2,100 Rs. to 4,912 Rs. in average family income experienced by recipient families since the FFW program began. Data are also presented on recipients' socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and on the organizational structure of FFW.","Cover date: January 1983","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Work|Nutritional status|Child nutrition|Employment|Income|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP361.pdf","3,652 KB","003755 - Centre for Research, Planning and Action","","008557 - USAID.

"Evaluates Food for Work (FFW) project to construct irrigation tanks in India's Delhi Zone.  Ex post impact evaluation covers construction during the period FY78-FY81 and is based on interviews with a sample of 444 beneficiaries and 148 nonbeneficiaries. A total of 29 tanks were constructed in Mirzapur, 5 in Mariabad, and 3 in Majghai, each with about 22 beneficiaries.  The FFW project distributed some 6,797 tons of bulgar and generated one-time employment of 1.68 million person-days.  Most beneficiaries were aged 31-50, nearly half were illiterate, 60% were from weaker castes, 97% were Hindus, and almost all were married and worked in agriculture.  About 59% had incomes above Rs. 1000/- per month, most owned their homes, and 80% owned more than 5 acres of unirrigated land.  Few had indoor plumbing or electricity. In Mirzapur, area irrigated increased by 65% during Kharif and 75% during Rabi seasons; in Mariabad by 27% during Kharif and 6.5% during Rabi; and in Majghai by 51% during Kharif and 65% during Rabi.  Paddy crops were planted on 85% of new irrigated land in Kharif, and wheat on 86% in Rabi. The value of output per beneficiary during Rabi increased by about 58% and per acre by about 44%.  During Kharif, the value of output per beneficiary increased by about 25% and per acre by 20%.  The FFW tank projects' ability to meet the large demand for irrigation during Rabi was largely responsible for the increase during that season. The tanks generated repetitive full-time employment for 345 people through increased productivity in irrigated areas. Overall, beneficiary incomes increased by 51% and employment levels by 17%.  The share of income from off-farm employment increased from 0.4% before the project to 0.6% after. Some 47% of beneficiaries reported that the project had improved their nutritional intake, while 55% mentioned lower incidence of illness, and 42% noted improved growth of children; 30% purchased more clothing, most improved personal assets, and 75% were better able to discharge social and economic obligations.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Work|Irrigation system construction|Reservoirs|Agricultural productivity|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP362.pdf","1,677 KB","003755 - Centre for Research, Planning and Action","","008557 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen farming systems research (FSR) in nine countries in Eastern and Southern Africa.  Special evaluation covers the period 5/82-10/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with A.I.D., International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), U.S. university, and host country personnel. Despite a late start-up in 1/83, the project has made significant progress, especially in the training and networking components. Comprehensive, 15-month, in-country FSR training programs are underway in Zambia and Malawi and should begin in Tanzania, Kenya, and Sudan. Although no trainees have yet completed a cropping cycle, the courses have been well-received.  Two-session FSR workshops have been held at the University of Zimbabwe (in 1983) for individuals from countries not yet ready for comprehensive training; demand for these courses has been double the capacity with requests coming from all over Africa. Networking activities, especially appreciated by small countries dependent on external technology input, have included:  an administrators' seminar and a technical workshop on animal traction for FSR and other researchers; inter-country technical/administrive visits (e.g., for Malawi personnel to Zimbabwe, Zambia); and a quarterly newsletter.  Also, CIMMYT has established collaborative relationships with U.S. universities, particularly with the University of Florida and its farming systems support project. CIMMYT has provided direct FSR assistance through exploratory visits to most of the nine countries and through special consultations (e.g., with Swaziland, Zambia, Malawi).  The latter yielded early and unexpected progress toward FSR institutionalization when Malawi and Zambia reorganized their agricultural research systems with a greater emphasis on FSR. The project has been hampered by lack of an agronomist, inadequate emphasis on livestock, and failure to adequately link extension and research. Key recommendations are to continue the grant and increase funding to enable CIMMYT to add at least one agronomist.","Attached to PD-AAP-377","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Farming systems|On farm research|Agricultural training|Agricultural cooperation","East Africa|Southern Africa","","","000491 - University of Florida","","000013 - USAID.

"Evaluates eight A.I.D. education projects implemented in Guatemala during the period 1969-83.  Special evaluation is based on document review, site visits, interviews with educators, field studies, and analysis of archival data. Overall, the projects (4 of which are ongoing), have been well-designed and have addressed rural Guatemala's most pressing education needs.  Although most major objectives have been realized, specific targets - which tended to be unrealistic - often were not met, due especially to late start-ups.  Many gains have been diffused beyond initial sites (e.g., the adoption of A.I.D. construction standards by government agencies).  Over 500 rural primary schools and 2 normal schools (Santa Lucia and Monjas) have been built/reconstructed and equipped and are in good condition, despite the absence of a Ministry of Education (MOE) school maintenance program.  However, much equipment is underused or unused. Fundamental change has occurred in the primary school curriculum, specifically, the introduction of complex problemsolving techniques (to replace rote memorization) in 100 rural schools, An ongoing project with considerable promise is developing bilingual texts (in Spanish and 4 Mayan languages) for preschool and grades one and two.  Two nonformal eudcation projects have built/equipped radio stations and tested the effectiveness of various media mixes.  While the first was entirely successful, later efforts have been hindered by an overly centralized administration and predominantly Spanish messages (5 of the 8 projects did not plan for the fact that most highland Indians do not speak Spanish).  A project to upgrade MOE staff - primarily through training - has made a good beginning. Some areas have not been so successful, however.  Few graduates of the two normal schools have been offered teaching positions, possibly due to political reasons.  Most texts in rural schools are some 15 years old and neither widely available nor widely used - although some 3.9 million texts/teachers' guides were printed, most remained for years in an MOE warehouse.  Use of the regional/satellite school concept (in pilot projects) was never institutitionalized and has been discontinued. Studies to assess the feasibility of using double school sessions and a flexible school calendar for migrant children indicate that both programs would succeed.  Another study suggests that bilingual promoters with 6th grade educations can be as effective as trained monolingual teachers.","Attached to PD-AAP-381","Special Evaluation","Documents","520-0000-C-00-3079-00","","12/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Primary education|Primary schools|Teacher training|Teacher education|Educational innovations|Educational methods|Bilingual education|Educational administration|Rural areas|Textbooks|Building construction|Nonformal education|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews|Public data","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP381A.pdf","4,065 KB","003757 - International Resource Development, Inc.","","008550 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the institutional capacity of the Government of Costa Rica (GOCR) to manage the country's natural resources.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/79-9/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with USAID/C and project personnel and with beneficiaries. Although only 25% of allotted funds have been expended due pimarily to delays in contracting for TA and in GOCR project ratification (delayed 18 months) and approval of funding, the project has made some progress.  Initial organizational difficulties have been resolved with the appointment of a highly motivated project director with full administrative authority and the establishment of an administrative office and central coordinating committee.  A training manual and program have been prepared and 8 inservice training sessions held for staff; 12 staff are attending graduate studies in Costa Rica and abroad. Of the pilot projects, microwatershed management (at Nosara) has been the most successful:  pasture improvement has exceeded its goal; 100 ha (vs. a targeted 400) of land have been reforested; 12 dams for gully control and 1200 m of ditches/channels for soil conservation have been built; test and demonstration plots of grass/legume species have been set up; and an updated management plan will soon be completed.  Other experimental activities have included:  conducting a resource inventory and developing a reforestation scheme in Sarapiqui; and improving 2,097 ha (vs. a targeted 3,120) of pasture and setting up farm demonstration plots and a small dairy in Pacifico Seco and Pacifico Central. Credit programs in the latter areas have been limited by GOCR regulations (a less stringent regulation was approved in 9/83); as of 8/83, 72 loans had been made to farmers to encourage reforestation efforts.  Four natural resource and forest management policy studies are also being conducted. Other problems have included:  rapid personnel turnover; lack of experienced personnel; inadequate cooperation between project components and with the Ministry of Agriculture; and complicated GOCR administrative procedures. Recommendations include to continue funding at least for the remainder of the project life.","Attached to PD-AAP-382|Loan no. 515-T-032","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource conservation|Natural resource management|Institution building|Environmental research|Watersheds|Erosion control|Reforestation|Environmental education|Environmental policy|Beneficiary interviews","Costa Rica","","","001050 - Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis, Inc.","","008533 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve nutritional status and food production among campesinos in Peru's Ancash Department.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/79-8/82 and is based on document review. The project has been implemented in 9 communities, with 542 families as direct beneficiaries.  Priority has generally been given to food production.  Production of seed potatoes has been very successful, and will ultimately reduce farmers' dependence on seed wholesalers and reduce their needs for cash.  Development of seed banks should be a principal goal of future project activities.  Although data are lacking on the production levels of other crops, cost-benefit ratios were evidently good for most crops, and especially so for cob corn. Little training in marketing strategies was provided to farmers, due to lack of trained staff in this area.  An agricultural economist should be contracted to either train project staff or work directly with farmers and communities.  In the latter case, the project, rather than providing farmers with all necessary inputs in exchange for 50% of their harvests, would finance inputs through a loan which farmers would repay after marketing their produce themselves. Regarding the nutrition component, the communal dining rooms were not accepted by beneficiaries and were closed at the beginning of the fourth year.  An alternative strategy, focusing on nutrition education among existing work groups, was developed and has been well-received, although in general nutritionists' inability to speak Quechua fluently has limited nutrition education.  Family gardens have been enthusiastically initiated in most communities; savings realized by the closing of the dining rooms should be utilized here.  Also, expansion of the nutrition program to include training in health promotion and disease prevention should be formalized with the Ministry of Health. There have been a number of management problems, e.g., lack of clear delineation of responsibilities among field staff, creating confusion internally and for beneficiaries as well; different employee benefits policies on the part of CARE and the National Office of food Support (ONAA), which hindered personnel administration; and the need to satisfy the reporting requirements of A.I.D., CARE, and ONAA.","Evaluation period: Aug 1979-Aug 1982","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Food production|Agricultural product marketing|Nutrition improvement|Gardening|Nutrition education|Beneficiary count|Limited data","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP393.pdf","1,098 KB","007518 - CARE International","","008591 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve the access of Yemen's rural poor to potable water and to strengthen the Rural Water Supply Division (RWSD) of the Yemen Arab Republic Government's (YARG's) Ministry of Public Works (MPW).  Special evaluation covers the period 8/80-10/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel. The project has made excellent progress.  Despite some start-up problems, construction of small water subprojects (SP's) is on schedule; 32 SP's - all of good to excellent quality - will be completed by 11/83. SP survey and design activities are ahead of schedule and cost estimating, construction, and construction supervision appear to have gone smoothly.  Villagers have created adequate maintenance and repair systems for completed SP's and are collecting funds and managing recurrent costs in a satisfactory manner.  Improvements in health status are impossible to substantiate given the newness of the SP's, but anecdotal evidence suggests these have indeed occurred, and that time spent fetching water has decreased; there is no evidence, however, for the social impacts envisioned in the project paper. The MPW does not yet have enough trained staff to replicate project activities, but it has improved its skill in SP planning and site selection.  On-the-job and classroom training has been provided to 28 Yemeni construction supervisors and to village operations and maintenance personnel.  Three Yemenis are almost fully qualified to independently supervise construction. Due to the high quality of its work and of its staff, New Transcentury Fund (NTF), the contractor, has established excellent relationships with the MPW and the RWSD, which bodes well for these agencies' ongoing institutional development.  To allow time for completion of the institutionalization process, a 5-year project extension is recommended. Lessons learned are:  quickly achievable and visible products strengthen A.I.D. and contractor credibility and provide the basis for institution building; good personal and working relationships between contractor and Ministry are equally important to institutional change; and Peace Corps volunteers can make major contributions to small-scale development projects.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Water supply structures|Institution building|Potable water","Yemen","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP391.pdf","2,598 KB","008624 - USAID.

"Evaluates information, education, and communication (IEC) component of a project to provide family planning (FP) services in Panama. Special evaluation covers the period 8/79-1/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with USAID/P and Government of Panama officials. With the Panamanian contraceptive usage rate at 63%, the crude birth rate near 27 per thousand, and the population growth rate at 2.1%, there is no urgency about FP within the Ministry of Health (MOH) and progress in developing the IEC component has been minimal.  The MOH has failed to create an IEC unit and, due to lack of funds, has not hired a qualified communications specialist to develop IEC programs.  Although IEC responsibility has recently shifted to the new head (and sole staff member) of the community organization and education unit, a significant acceleration of IEC activities seems unlikely.  Media have not been fully exploited:  radio use has been sporadic and limited as to format; there has been overreliance on films rather than less expensive slides, flip charts, cassettes, and folk media; and with the exception of five posters and five leaflets (not yet available), no print materials have been developed.  Although the posters and leaflets were designed for rural use, they are unsuitable for rural audiences; otherwise, little attempt has been made to develop messages for different segments of the audience.  A positive note, local staff members who have received few or no materials from MOH headquarters have begun to develop their own. Recommendations are included.","Attached to PD-AAP-497|Evaluation period: 15-28 Jan 1983","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning promotion programs|Family planning education|Information dissemination|IEC|Beneficiary count|Needs assessments","Panama","","","002455 - Johns Hopkins University.

"Evaluates the contraceptive supply and logistics system of a project to provide family planning (FP) services in Panama. Special evaluation covers the period 8/79-6/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with Government of Panama (GOP) and health facility personnel. Although Ministry of Health logistics staff and contraceptive distribution at the regional and local levels appear quite efficient, distribution at the national level has been seriously hampered by communications difficulties and an acute shortage of vehicles and fuel. All health facilties visited reported receiving contraceptives, however quantities and types available varied greatly.  At more than 70% of the facilities, only 4 of the 12 most frequently used contraceptives were available. Health personnel complained that supplies were delayed (56%), lacking in the required types (67%), or insufficient in quantity (45%). Although storage facilities are satisfactory, the inventory system is inadequate:  contraceptives are not stored or distributed according to the date of receipt.  Health facility personnel mentioned the need for more contraceptive training; information was particularly lacking on low-dose oral contraceptives.","Attached to PD-AAP-497","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Logistics|Clinic-based contraceptive distribution","Panama","","","","","008589 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to extend family planning (FP) services, institutionalize sex education, and expand FP information, education, and communication (IEC) outreach activities in Panama. Special evaluation covers the period 8/79-7/83; no methodology is given. Despite delays and problems experienced by the implementing institutions (the Ministry of Health - MOH, Ministry of Education - MOE, Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare National Directorate for the Child and Family - DINNFA, Institute for Special Education - IPHE, and International Planned Parenthood Affiliate of Panama), the project has contributed to a reduction in the crude birth rate from 29 per thousand in 1978 to 27.4 in 1981. The sex education component was initially delayed by difficulties encountered by all five institutions in meeting conditions precedent and developing training plans and by administrative, program, and staff changes.  However, over 80% of secondary school guidance counselors have now received training and a sex education curriculum, developed for three secondary levels, is being tested in five schools.  The MOH's interinstitutional National Commission on Sex Education has coordinated a series of courses for staff of the involved institutions.  They, in turn, have developed their own training programs:  DINNFA for its program staff; IPHE for its teachers; MOE, initially, for its administrative and technical personnel and later, for the counselors; and the MOH for regional health personnel.  Although each institution has created lists of needed audiovisual and other supplies, institutional administrative incompetence has delayed their procurement. encyclopedias are being delivered to schools and DINNFA has received an extra vehicle. MOH implementation of the FP services component has been hampered by: limited staff; contraceptive distribution problems (e.g., shortages of some contraceptive types in remote areas due to lack of vehicles and fuel); and inadequate supervision of and TA for MOH field staff. Recommendations are given.","Attached to PD-AAP-497","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning promotion programs|Contraceptive distribution|Sex education|Limited data","Panama","","","008589 - USAID.

"Evaluates multidonor project to help the Government of Rwanda (GOR) strengthen its Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI). Special joint evaluation (WHO, UNICEF, A.I.D., GOR) covers the period 8/79-6/83 and is based on document review, indepth interviews with EPI officials and workers, studies of immunization coverage, and mortality and morbidity data. Key findings are:  (1) Administration - At present the EPI lacks the core staff which will be needed to assure program continuity. Problems at the supervisory level include:  lack of personnel stability; insufficient gasoline rations; failure to work out a systematic surveillance plan, which has led to underuse of some centers and/or vaccinators; and slow reimbursement of staff expenses. (2) Operations - The vaccine cold chain meets EPI criteria.  All but 2 of the 31 health centers visited are equipped with electric refrigerators/freezers.  All centers have a fixed immunization program which includes health education and 17 have a mobile unit program as well.  Eight out of 10 regional EPI supervisors have an assistant, meeting acceptable personnel levels.  About 58% of field personnnel have had inservice training.  Many health center personnel are poorly trained in cold chain management, organization of immunization sessions, and supply management. (3) Immunization coverage - A study of 854 randomly selected households indicates that the EPI has gone beyond its coverage objectives for individual vaccinations (except the third administration of polio vaccine - which, due to poor planning, was in low supply) in both 1982 and 1983.  Some 21% of children were completely vaccinated (vs. a targeted 30%). (4) Epidemiological surveillance - Countrywide incidence of measles and whooping cough in 1982 was the lowest recorded since 1973. Statistics from 3 centers known for having active immunization programs show an even sharper drop, but more data are needed in order to confidently attribute this decrease to the EPI program; only a few centers distinguish when reporting between vaccinated and non-vaccinated cases of a disease. It is recommended that donors continue to financially and technially support EPI in Rwanda.  Several operational recommendations are also made.","Attached to PD-AAP-504","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Immunizations|Child health care|Clinics|Health care administration|Epidemiology|Health education|Cold storage|Public health care|Mobile health services|Beneficiary count|Public data|Sampling method","Rwanda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP504A.pdf","2,167 KB","003791 - Rwanda.

"Evaluates project to help the Caribbean Community Secretariat (CARICOM) upgrade management of primary health care (PHC) systems in the West Indies and the Caribbean by providing management training and TA to national Ministries of Health (MOH's) and to community health aides. Final internal evaluation covers the period 8/78-12/82. Considering the time-frame of actual activities (3.5 years), the project, modified five times in response to changing conditions, achieved most of its goals, largely through the efforts of country coordinators.  In the major training effort, training packages were delivered, mostly within participating countries, to a total of 1,342 individuals in basic management skills (814), team-building (385), and supervisory management (316).  It became apparent early in the project, however, that management training needs in the region had been greatly underestimated.  Further, success seems more evident on the individual level; systemic changes have generally been slow, although highly visible where they have occurred, e.g., the initiation of team training for senior MOH management/technical teams in Dominica, Grenada, and St. Lucia.  These countries now seem ready for an organizational development approach. The project design did not provide for follow-up or for helping countries implement change, a task that was too huge to be undertaken by the Project Manager.  Lack of funds continued to limit implementation until the end, e.g., by curtailing transportation of staff to underserved areas and follow-up to the Planning Process Workshops, the late implementation of which was a definite drawback.  While an effective health information system is operative in three of the participating countries and the other six have updated their systems, this remains a major problem area due in part to the lack of trained manpower and shortage of funds.","Attached to PD-AAP-556","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Regional development|Government departments|Health care administration|Management training","Eastern Caribbean|West Indies|Dominica|Grenada|Saint Lucia|Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Montserrat|Saint Kitts-Nevis|Belize|Antigua and Barbuda|Barbados","","","001587 - Caribbean Community (CARICOM).

"Evaluates project implemented by the Save the Children Foundation (SCF) to institutionalize a community-based integrated rural development (CBIRD) methodology in central Tunisia.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/81-4/83 and is based on site visits and interviews with Government of Tunisia (GOT) officials and community participants. Project results have been mixed.  Of 11 agricultural and health-oriented SCF subprojects (SP's) visited, 6 (e.g, to increase the irrigated perimeter, to provide health/nutrition education and handicrafts/literacy training) in 4 communities, have successfully used the CBIRD participatory approach and achieved their objectives; beneficiary incomes and food availability have increased, urban emigrants have returned, and interest has been shown in replicating SP's elsewhere.  SP's have been most successful in poor communities where individuals have few vested interests and receive few GOT benefits or when SP's have been initiated within an established structure.  Two other SP's have been only moderately successful and 3 have failed. Rather than formal training (rejected by the GOT technical cadre, and limited by inadequate technical specialization of SCF staff), an informal collaborative approach has proven most effective in efforts to institutionalize CBIRD:  e.g., developing a training program for a rural maternal/child health center; having GOT administrators visit SCF SP's; using the technical expertise of the Central Tunisian Development Authority in SCF irrigation planning; conducting a 2-week field survey in Beze with Social Affairs School students; and involving social worker trainees in SCF SP's.  In 1983 the GOT funded 80% of needed SCF SP materials/equipment; SCF involvement in GOT-initiated SP's has also expanded. The project has been hampered by:  an inexperienced SCF staff (early on); inappropriate selection of some communities and SP's; a lack of SP follow-up (too few SCF staff spread over too wide a geographical area); and excessive turnover of SCF directors (3 directors and 4 interim directors in about 5 years), although a permanent director is now in place. Recommendations are included.","Attached to PD-AAP-619","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Community participation|Host country cooperation|Community self help|Beneficiary interviews","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP619A.pdf","1,698 KB","008616 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase dryland cereals production in Morocco by introducing high-yield varieties (HYV's) developed by the International Center for Corn and Wheat Improvement (CIMMYT). Ex post impact evaluation is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project officials. Positively, the project contributed to the use of HYV's of bread wheat in Morocco, spurred initiation of a program to breed improved bread and durum wheat varieties, and may have helped increase wheat production over the past 10 years.  However, the choice of HYV's, which were available only for bread wheat, as the key project technology limited project impact because bread wheat represented only 25% of wheat production.  Ultimately, this made it impossible to reach the target of increasing production by 600,000 tons. The HYV's were widely adopted by large farm operators (who have been the major project beneficiaries) and on irrigated lands, but the adoption rate among smaller, dryland farmers was much lower due to the high risk involved and the project's failure to establish the institutional base needed to involve these farmers. Small farmer use of improved technology is increasing, however. While producer prices were generally weighted in favor of wheat farmers, other policies - despite government rhetoric - did not generally support technology adoption and increased wheat production. Although Morocco has benefited from a continuing relationship with CIMMYT, there has been little progress in institutionalizing research and extension services since the project's termination. Lessons learned are that:  agricultural projects should take account of the extremely important risk factor and the relationship between livestock and cereal production; it is highly probable that economic, social, physical, and technological changes will directly or indirectly affect achievement of a project's objectives; government priorities must be fully understood in order to ensure that project priorities are consistent with them; and ongoing analysis of technical, social, and economic problems requires the institutionalization of effective support systems.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural production|Cultivars|Yield increase|Dry farming|Bread grains|Government policy|Agricultural prices","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP654.pdf","858 KB","008579 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to create an Agricultural Statistics and Analysis Unit (ASAU) within the Government of Rwanda's (GOR's) Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MINAGRI).  Special evaluation covers the period 11/79-9/83 (including a pre-implementation phase, 11/79-1/81) and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project staff. MINAGRI's capacity for data collection, processing, and analysis has been greatly enhanced by the institutionalization of ASAU, which is staffed by 3 GOR managerial personnel (vs. the 7 targeted), 2 TA advisors, 155 interviewers, 18 verifiers, 10 supervisors, and 10 assistants (the total staff is 30 more than planned).  Staff training has included long-term U.S. study for 2 (a statistician and a systems analyst) and short-term statistics courses for 3 in Zaire and for several supervisors in America. Also, supervisors (trained by TA and GOR managerial staff) have delivered 4 weeks of training to the interviewers. The pilot agricultural survey has been completed, including fieldwork on a stratified sample of 710 households and office verification of 100% of the data; computer editing and tabulation are underway.  Preliminary results have revealed basic characteristics of farm households, land use, and livestock ownership.  The National Agricultural Survey is now in progress. Other outputs include designing computer programs and producing survey questionnaires, manuals, and pilot survey analytical documents. Problems, since resolved, have included:  insufficient long-term TA (an advisor arrived in 8/83); inadequate interviewer training and supervision (more training is planned, some supervisors have been replaced); low interviewer morale (bonuses are now given for correct questionnaires); and unexpectedly high operating costs (a monthly allowance system is now in place).  Continuing problems include: inadequate computer access; lack of programmers and of a computer advisor; lack of skilled GOR personnel to fill ASAU positions; low morale among ASAU managers (due to a heavy workload, low salaries); difficulties in firing interviewers who are regular GOR employees; and inadequate transportation. Recommendations are included.","Attached to PD-AAP-656","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Agricultural surveys|Statistical analysis|Data processing|Data collection|Statistical data","Rwanda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP656A.pdf","1,617 KB","008598 - USAID.

"Evaluates program to use local currency generated by P.L. 480, Title II, Section 206 commodities to finance local projects in Rwanda. Special evaluation covers the period 3/80-6/83; no methodlogy is indicated. The program has generally been successful, especially in channeling local currency generations through OPROVIA, the local marketing agent for Section 206 commodities, and through the Ministry of the Interior's (MOI) Communal Development Fund (CDF) to local communal officials and also in the latter's use of the funds to construct a grain silo, 4 nutrition centers, and a health center extension, benefiting the neediest sectors of the population.  Although two of the nutrition centers have been used as dispensaries, a deviation from plans agreed upon by A.I.D. and the MOI, the changes were made for sound reasons and have directly served local needs. These efforts were delayed, however, due to the fact that Government of Rwanda-A.I.D. negotiations on what projects should be financed did not begin until commodity sales had been completed; in the future, negotiations should be conducted while commodities are being delivered and sold. Other recommendations are to:  (1) instruct the MOI to reallocate funds that were programmed for the nonapproved silos at Muguba and Satinskyi; (2) study the cost-effectiveness of extending the Nyagahanga health center to accomodate the PMI maternal/child health immunization program; (3) discuss with the Bourgemeister the possibility of establishing the Tare silo as a private enterprise run by the commune; (4) construct an extension to the Rushashi silo as planned; and (5) improve future programs by encouraging the CDF to deposit local currency generations in an interest-bearing account, having all concerned parties meet regularly to obviate misunderstandings and improve monitoring, and taking measures to reduce OPROVIA's 30% overhead cost, which results in a significant loss to the target population.","Attached to PD-AAP-670","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title II|Community development|Counterpart fund|Limited data","Rwanda","","","","","008598 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to enable unskilled urban slum women to build 100 houses in San Miguelito, Panama.  Preliminary evaluation prepared by the contractor covers the period 10/81-11/82 and is based on a questionnaire survey of beneficiaries and interviews with staff of supporting institutions. The project has proven a worthwhile investment.  Eighty-three women, 80 of whom had received short-term training in masonry, plumbing, and carpentry, were provided with land, onsite supervision, and construction materials for their own houses, and use of heavy equipment and tools, as well as a monthly stipend. Working together, the women had completed 50 houses, including plumbing and electrical connections, by 11/82, as well as site facilities (storage buildings, changing rooms/showers, and lunchroom). Participants (who were indeed low-income women, with generally low educational levels and high unemployment rates) were pleased with the construction experience and, while the women's rate of production is far below professional norms, the quality of their work is equivalent or superior to that of a professional crew. Although the project design calls for participants to repay stipends and material costs after project completion, due to their low incomes, only 36% of the women would be able to do so using standard 25-year, 12% mortgages.  Nonetheless, project benefits (housing, an estimated 10% increase in participant's potential earnings, the positive participatory experience, and other indirect benefits) far outweigh costs and the project's internal rate of return is higher than that of comparable construction directed by the Panamanian Ministry of Housing. Replicability will depend on political support (a key factor in the success of this project), the availability of low-cost land and materials, adaptability to large scale production, and cost recovery. It is recommended that A.I.D. continue monitoring the project as it moves into its second phase; consider the alternative cost recovery mechanisms outlined in the evaluation; help to develop, on a pilot basis, community enterprises that will utilize skills developed by the project; and consider further self-help housing projects.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DSAN-C-0269","","4/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Women|Community self help|Low cost housing|Building construction|Urban areas|Beneficiary interviews","Panama","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP676.pdf","980 KB","000616 - International Center for Research on Women (ICRW)","","008589 - USAID.

"Evaluates subproject to help the Accion Pro-Educacion y Cultura's Training and Advisory Center for Women (APEC/CENAM) provide vocational training (VT) to poor women in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Special mid-term evaluation covers the period 7/81-6/83 and is based on document review, attendance at CENAM courses, and interviews with staff and beneficiaries. As finally designed with TA from the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW), the project was reoriented to prepare women for entry into the informal rather than the formal labor market by providing VT in nontraditional skills and access to credit.  However, although CENAM's dedicated promotoras have successfully promoted VT (1,252 women were waiting to be enrolled by 5/83), inadequate CENAM technical direction (both from a far removed and overburdened project director and onsite) and inadequate support from the CENAM board, together with CENAM staff's lack of experience in VT, make project objectives unattainable.  Training in nontraditional skills, a central feature of the project design, comprises only 25% of CENAM courses (due to the fact that such courses are not currently offered in SantoDomingo) and no entrepreneurial or management training has been offered; the human resource development courses have a high dropout rate (41% vs. 7% in vocational courses); credit and the employment-related support services and TA needed to overcome the considerable obstacles to women's entry into the labor force have not been utilized due to a lack of technical expertise; and legal and psychological counseling have been underpromoted. Recommendations are that CENAM:  hire a full-time technical coordinator; provide more nontraditional vocational and entrepreneurial training; contract ADEMI (unidentified acronym) to manage fixed and working capital loans; develop a participant follow-up system to monitor progress in creating/stimulating employment; provide additional training to promotoras; decentralize its structure and shift all technical matters to the technical coordinator and the Capotillo office; eliminate the position of assistant coordinator; and establish closer contact with A.I.D.  A.I.D. should not fund similar projects until this project is functioning as designed.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DSAN-C-0269","","6/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Vocational training|Employment|Management training|Entrepreneurs|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP677.pdf","898 KB","000616 - International Center for Research on Women (ICRW)","","008537 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve basic education in North Yemen. Special evaluation covers the period 1979-9/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with Sana'a University, Eastern Michigan University (EMU), and MOE staff and with participant trainees. Although there were serious delays early on and target dates still are not being met, substantial progress has been made, particularly in subprojects (SP's) for Primary Teacher Training (PTT) and Primary and Science Education (PSE).  Under PTT, 77 primary teacher trainers have received M.A.'s from EMU, while under PSE, a curriculum and materials center, two science laboratories, and a mathematics laboratory have been designed (the laboratories should be in operation in early 1984).  Also under PSE, the administrative, curricular, and pedagogical capabilities of Sana'a University's Faculty of Education are being substantially improved, through high-quality TA and U.S. graduate training of 12 faculty.  Outputs of the Administrative Support SP (which should be eliminated or redesigned) include one short-term inservice training program and U.S. graduate training for two MOE officials.  Project successes are due largely to the dedication of EMU staff and faculty and the commitment of USAID/Y and Yemeni personnel. Nonetheless, achievements are less significant than could be, due to design flaws and deficiencies in planning, management, and monitoring. Redesign into two components (the first to focus on curriculum reform and instructional materials for teacher training institutions and primary schools, the second to include all project training) is suggested.  Other recommendations include modifications to PSE and PTT and termination of the Collaborative Assistance Mode SP as an independent activity. Some tentative lessons may be inferred from project experience: (1) the existence of adequate supporting infrastructure must be ensured before initiating a project; (2) activities that have met extended resistance should be eliminated or redesigned (not pushed through); (3) participants should be selected carefully and held to rigorous and consistent academic standards; (4) the MOE's negative reaction to foreign experts delving into its administrative and structural problems could have been predicted.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Basic education|Primary education|Science education|Teacher education|Universities and colleges|Beneficiary interviews","Yemen","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP705.pdf","2,224 KB","003211 - Wu P'i, Inc.","","008624 - USAID.

"Evaluates pilot subproject to develop village silviculture in Mali's Mopti region.  Mid-term special evaluation covers the period 6/81-6/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with officials from USAID/M, Government of Mali, and independent organizations and with residents of 14 project and nonproject villages. Three 1-ha tree nurseries have been created at Mopti, Bandiagara, and Djenne, although construction of infrastructure is behind schedule, as are nursery improvements needed for seedling cultivation.  The efficiency of the nurseries has been low, however, due to poor management; current resources could yield a much higher output.  Success rates of demonstration woodlots at Mopti and Bandiagara were 60% and 30%, respectively (as of 6/83), and were 40% (1982) and 74% (1983) for the village woodlots at the two stations considered cumulatively. Individual plantings of shade trees were satisfactory, but planting for alignment was not successful; neither live hedges nor windbreaks have yet been planted.  Efforts to popularize reforestation suffered from lack of technical expertise; efforts to popularize improved wood stoves were counterproductive as the stove models were not accepted by village women. There are several problem areas - the vagueness of the project design; the falseness of the assumption that planting village woodlots for firewood would be profitable to villagers (this component should be phased out and replaced by planting trees for fertilization, erosion control, and shade); the lack of decisionmaking authority by station chiefs and those below them in rank; an apparent lack of initiative at all project levels; and the need to improve the poject's technical quality by assigning a technician to serve as associate to the Direction Regional des Eaux et Forets (DREF) in Mopti, increasing the technical and extension training of Malian personnel, and preparing technical reports to project management.  Adoption of a cost accounting system for use in the economic and technical analysis of project components by function and objective and the promotion of private nurseries are also recommended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Pilot projects|Silviculture|Nurseries|Agricultural extension|Experimental farms|Reforestation|Villages|Beneficiary interviews","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP706.pdf","1,433 KB","","","008575 - USAID.

"Evaluates supervised credit program (SCP) of the Employment Planning and Generation Project in Panama.  Special evaluation covers the period 10/81-6/83 and is based on document and loan data review, interviews with project personnel, and - due to the incompleteness of loan data in the files of the implementing agency, the National Bank of Panama (BNP) - a random sample field survey. Although the BNP has expended an enormous amount of energy on its recordkeeping system, loan data are seriously incomplete. addition, the BNP's definition of its target groups has been inconsistent.  After initially lending to both new and existing enterprises, it ceased in 1983 to consider new proposals.  Also, because no loan floor was established, 23% of approvals are below $10,000 (some so small that no jobs are created), while as the result of a lack of guidelines, loans have recently been concentrated in the metropolitan area after having been distributed evenly between urban and rural areas.  Further, the evolution of a more conservative lending policy has resulted in a decreased number of loans per quarter, with a concomitant rise in the average loan value, and the TA program, designed to assist inexperienced entrepreneurs, has diminished in usefulness with the BNP's shift to more sophisticated clients. For a summary of statistical data on the program, see the abstract of the attached PES (PD-AAP-351).  The most repeated of the many recommendations made is that the BNP introduce a logical and comprehensive information system.  A sketch of the needs of such a system is included in the text.","Attached to PD-AAP-851","Special Evaluation","Documents","DAN-1135-A-00-1078-00","","8/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Small scale enterprises|Commercial credit|Banks|Management operations|Sampling method","Panama","","","000363 - Clark University.

"Evaluates Catholic Relief Services' (CRS) community development (CD) and P.L. 480 Title II food distribution programs in Ecuador. Special evaluation, conducted by CRS and USAID/E, covers a period to 5/83 and is based on site visits and discussions with campesinos. The CD program appears consonant with CRS goals.  Four current CD projects (in which community promoters use a problem-solving approach to community organization) seem to be on track and a fifth appears promising, although most communities remain in the early stages of group development and CRS's group development model needs to be made more practical and to be evaluated more effectively. CRS sees little relation between its CD and food distribution programs, despite the development purposes which food can serve, e.g., as a catalyst for community cohesion, as capital for project financing, and as a means of teaching nutrition, hygiene, and group skills.  As was observed, however, food can also have the anti-development effects of dependency and passivity, a ""give-me"" attitude, and - in sierra communities - the undermining of community work traditions. Specifically, the School Feeding (SF) program has not involved students in serving, ordering, and preparing food and the Maternal/Child Health (MCH) program provides little beyond food, although women's groups undertaking additional activities (e.g., classes in literacy) have sprung up at most MCH centers.  These negative effects, mainly due to a lack of qualified staff and of complementary physical and human inputs, must be overcome if the MCH and SF programs are to continue.  More positively, the pilot Food for Work project in Manabi provides a fine example of how to use food effectively for CD purposes, and CRS urban day care centers have maintained a high quality, although the need for similar facilities in rural areas remains unmet. Recommendations are, inter alia, to:  expand the day care portion of the Other Child Feeding program to rural areas; develop alternatives to the current MCH program; make SF a learning experience by increasing student participation and by incorporating health/nutrition education and school gardens into the program; and consider monetizing Title II food to capitalize CD projects.","Attached to PD-AAP-912","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title II|Community development|Private voluntary organizations|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data plus","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP912A.pdf","1,770 KB","008538 - USAID.

"Evaluates program to distribute P.L. 480 Title II foods at maternal/child health (MCH) centers in Haiti.  Special evaluation covers the period 1979-8/83 and is based on document review, a sample survey of 39 of 519 centers, and interviews with center directors and mothers. Much improvement is needed.  Positively, although the number of pregnant and lactating mothers receiving food for themselves is small, mothers are generally pleased with the program; 49% of those interviewed acknowledged that the program has led to changes in their cooking habits.  The PVO's - CARE, Catholic Relief Services, Seventh Day Adventist World Service (SAWS), and Church World Service - have made considerable efforts in the past year to upgrade their training programs (SAWS built an up-to-date training facility) and their staffs possess good training abilities, but more training is still needed, especially for the roughly one-third of center directors who lack basic training in nutritional assessment and intervention. On the debit side, inappropriate selection criteria and poor monitoring have helped make it difficult to assure regular participant turnover at the centers, and in almost one-third of the centers surveyed little or no effort has been made to target food to the most nutritionally deprived.  While children are for the most part weighed regularly, growth monitoring is not directly linked to participation in the program.  Again, although food preparation, child care and hygiene, and oral rehydration therapy are taught at a significant number of centers (and all but three provide some form of instruction), both subject coverage and attendance by mothers vary widely and little attention is paid to growth monitoring and family planning. Supervision and control of the centers, especially in regard to programmatic components, is seriously inadequate, although there are exceptions, the most notable being the Centre Integre de Nutrition Education Communautaire, which comprises 20% of the centers.  Also, overall community participation in the centers has been low because few centers offer activities such as crafts likely to attract participation; outreach has had little impact on agricultural practices; and more coordination with Government of Haiti agencies is needed.","Evaluation period: Jul-Aug 1983","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Maternal child feeding programs|Food for Peace Title II|Clinics|Nutrition education|Child nutrition|Private voluntary organizations|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ028.pdf","1,280 KB","008554 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to reduce Swaziland's critical shortage of technical and managerial manpower.  Special evaluation covers the period 1978-12/83 and is based on interviews with 35 returned participants and with operational expert (OPEX) advisors. Eighty participants returned to Swaziland after receiving academic and non-academic training in the United States and Africa.  Of these, 52 received long-term U.S. training at the Bachelor's degree, Master's degree, and Certificate/Diploma level, while 19 received short-term U.S training and were awarded certificates of achievement or certificates in a specialized field.  Nine persons received long-term training in Africa, mostly at the East and Southern African Management Institute in Arusha. The participants queried felt that the training program had met their professional objectives and had improved their performance in their present positions.  Most considered that their allowances for living overseas were adequate, although received late in several instances.  On the negative side, many expressed disappointment at being underutilized in their positions. Despite having earned higher qualifications and even a promotion as a result of their training, many have returned to lower salaries due to Government of Swaziland wage regulations.  Also, a number of participants felt they had been rudely treated in the course of their training by the subcontractor providing the backstopping. Returnees expressed high interest in providing input into a follow-on project and in helping USAID/S prioritize manpower training needs. The OPEX advisors interviewed believe that they have influenced policy and planning through their work and have broken new ground for the ministry for which they work.

"Evaluation of program implementation and performance from 1978 to 1983, with emphasis on later period; discusses the policy context at the macro level, grain market issues, program administration, and project performance. Finds the program successful, particularly in supporting macroeconomic reform.  Delays in project implementation threaten the loan reduction value of the Title III program, due to devaluation of the currency.  Recommends shifting offset to policy performance basis. Cites program contribution to balance-of-payments support.  Title III-financed studies provided important support to the reform maintaining public investments in the rural sector. Project progress has been much slower than expected, due to A.I.D contracting delays.  Concludes that local currency provided significant support to A.I.D project implementation, but does not assess program impact on rural sector.  Concludes that information on possible disincentive impact is inconclusive, due to widely varying estimates of the gap between local production and requirements.  Title III has contributed to success in policy reform in the food sector, including price reform for wheat products. The Sudan program effectively combines program assistance aimed at policy reform with project support through local currency generation. Management burdens were underestimated and became a major problem in the early years, but systems are now in place for adequate control and monitoring.  The requirement for Washington approval of individual project budgets continues to be a problem.

"Evaluates project to upgrade the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council's (PARC's) national research system.  External evaluation covers the period since project redesign in 1978 through 10/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with Government of Pakistan (GOP) and USAID/P personnel and with researchers. After delays due to poor planning and broken GOP-U.S. relations in 1979, the project has progressed steadily.  Construction at the National Agricultural Research Center (NARC), an excellent facility for centralized research and training, is virtually complete and an improved system for coordinating agricultural research nationwide is now emerging.  Nine National Coordinated Programs (NCP's) have been instituted, of which four are in an advanced stage:  (1) wheat, barley, and triticale; (2) maize, sorghum, and millet; (3) rice; and (4) oilseeds.  The wheat NCP has been impressive and production is now over 12 million tons - vs. less than 8 million tons in 1978 due to a rust epidemic. Modest progress has been made in linking research and extension; most research centers are conducting field trials, and PARC has initiated traveling seminars and production campaigns for major crops. More progress in needed, however, in farming systems research (FSR), planning, agricultural education, and research funding. (1) Although an FSR seminar was held, the NARC, understaffed in the social sciences, has been unable to initiate FSR.  The PARC system as a whole has similar staffing deficiencies.  (2) PARC research planning is still at an evolutionary stage.  A planning unit has been established, but needs more resources and stronger analytic capabilities.  (3) Postgraduate agricultural training programs in Pakistan are inadequately equipped and funded and are understaffed in certain disciplines.  Overseas training under the project has been successful (of 105 trainees, most receiving advanced degrees, 78 have returned, generally to suitable work with their sponsoring agencies), but has weakened demand for in-country degree training.  (4) Delays and uncertainties in the release of funds by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) have adversely affected NARC and PARC-funded projects.  Fair salary scales, advancement opportunities, and adequate facilities and support services are policy issues which must be addressed. An important lesson is that time, patience, perseverance, and flexibility are vital to the successful development of institutions and have been the key to the project's success. Recommendations are made for improving NARC's administrative structure and upgrading lagging PARC programs.

"Evaluates project to help India's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOH/FW) improve access to basic health and family planning (FP) services in 14 districts in five states.  Mid-point evaluation covers the period 8/80-11/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel. Important quantitative outputs regarding construction of new facilities, training of health workers, and drug and equipment provision have been achieved.  These outputs have been distributed unevenly, however, and do not necessarily reflect improved service quality.  There is ample, albeit unmeasureable, evidence that overall FP performance - the main project target to date - has improved; measuring the project's various health impacts must await completion of the baseline survey in year 3. Several implementation problems exist.  (1) Expansion has clearly been favored over management.  A scheduled needs assessment was not completed and a planned management information system has not been implemented.  (2) In the area of training, a needs assessment found significant deficiencies in the competency of village, subcenter, and PHC personnel.  In particular, a lack of understanding and appreciation of PHC concepts among PHC medical officers presents one of the most difficult challenges to the project.  While the MPW (undefined) and community health guides schemes have had a positive effect on the states' health care programs, there is little opportunity for promotional training or career advancement.  The idea of ""competency-based"" training has not been fully implemented, training schools are poorly equipped, teacher attendance is poor, and school-related transportation is lacking.  Finally, the training of supervisors is hierarchical in style, there are shortcomings in applying the team training concept, and Medical Officers often lack appropriate training. (3) A communications needs assessment has taken longer than anticipated to start and to complete.  (4) The progress of and funding for the National Task Force on Communication for Health and Family Welfare and associated area projects have been uneven. (5) Staffing problems have hindered the operation of various technical cells.  As a result, the expected expansion and improvement of service/support systems has hardly begun.  In a related area, operations research has not been conducted because none of the research cells in any of the five states are operational, and the TA needed to identify appropriate projects is lacking.  (6) There is need to plan an ex post survey of the project's impact. Over 60 recommendations are provided.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the Government of Upper Volta's (GOUV's) Forestry Service (FS) by training FS employees as village-level forestry extensionists and by designing and implementing a replicable management plan for the Dinderosso Forest Reserve.  External evaluation covers the period through 4/83 and is based on site visits and interviews. The project has suffered from delays, confusion, and ineffective management.  More than 2 years were lost waiting for staff and equipment to arrive, the GOUV has failed to meet its financial obligations and to provide qualified management counterparts, and misunderstandings about funding procedures and the proper role of the U.S. Department of Agriculture advisors have led to distrust on both sides.  The FS - traditionally more involved in forest law enforcement than in extension - lacks the human resources and attitudes needed to design and implement a model forest management plan; the proposed plan is only marginally replicable. Nevertheless, positive accomplishments have been notable. Vehicles and equipment are in place or on order, and infrastructural improvements at the Dindorosso Forest Training Center are nearly complete. Significantly improved curricula and teaching methods have been implemented at the Center and attendance has grown from 10 to 40 students; 19 students have graduated from the Center's revised 1-year program and 10 from its 2-year program, while 40 more 1-year students are due to graduate in each of the next 2 years.  However, Voltaic instructors for the Center have not been available for training. The U.S. advisors have begun managing the Forest Reserve with procedures for inventory, fire control, planting, thinning, wood harvest and sale, mapping, boundary survey, and control of illegal harvest. It is recommended that the project be extended - contingent upon timely GOUV acceptance of and compliance with provisions to resolve problems with disbursement and staff assignments - in order to upgrade the Voltaic teaching staff, further revise the curricula and teaching methods, and raise the instructional level by instituting more stringent entrance requirements and providing at least 2 years of study.  A full-time project manager should be appointed.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AFR-0235-C-00-3028-00","","4/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural extension training|Forestry|Natural resource management|Protected environmental areas|Limited data","Burkina Faso","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ343.pdf","438 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates project to support efforts by INADES-FORMATION, a West African training organization, to bolster the skills of farmers and extensionists in the Touboro region of North Cameroon. Special evaluation covers the period to 5/83 and is based on interviews with farmers who had taken from 1 to 4 years of correspondence courses. As a result of the courses, 70% of respondents experienced an increase in cotton output between 1980 and 1982.  To varying degrees, the training has helped farmers to implement modern agricultural techniques in such areas as:  field preparation and selection; seed purchase; proper density row seeding; fertilizer and pesticide use; livestock rearing; and crop management.  Less success has been achieved with regard to garden crops and use of irrigation and erosion-prevention techniques.  In addition, training of women has been minimal and farmers have undertaken few collective efforts.  Generally, the relationship between farmers and extension agents has been improved.  Relationships with other villagers, however, have been mixed; some villagers are hostile or jealous, while others are eager to learn from participating farmers. It is recommended that training focus more on the financial aspects of farm management, that collective actions be encouraged, and that more training be given to extensionists.","Grant no.

"Evaluates International Institute for Rural Reconstruction (IIRR) activities in leadership training, international extension, and field operations, research, and evaluation.  Evaluation covers the period through 5/83 and is based on site observations and interviews with project officials. At the time, IIRR had an annual budget of about $1.3 million, which was small for its international mission and staff.  About half of its funds were from private donors, one third from A.I.D., and the rest from training fees, etc.  Due to its limited finances, IIRR devoted much time to fundraising, thus depriving other pursuits. Funds supported three main activities.  (1) Education and training, particularly leadership training, were outstanding. Some 585 participants from 37 countries have been trained, and the demand far exceeded IIRR capacity.  (2) International extension/outreach to affiliated movements was underfunded:  in 1981, only 14% of funds went to extension efforts in other countries - an amount insufficient to meet the needs of sister movements.  (3) Field operations, research, and evaluation activities accounted for half of IIRR's expenditures, but of this only a small portion was for research and evaluation.  Field operations represented the single most important IIRR activity in terms of funds, staff, time, and energy.  However, field projects (in e.g., cooperatives, health, feed production) put IIRR into competition with its affiliates. The evaluator concludes that so many resources went into field operations that IIRR was unable to fulfill research and extension functions.  It is recommended that IIRR redistribute its limited resources to devote more to international extension, research, and training and less to field operations, and thus serve international development more fully.

"Evaluates project to help the Government of Egypt (GOE) to increase poultry meat and egg production.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/78-9/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with poultry producers and USAID/E and GOE personnel. The project did not unfold as planned.  During Phase I, 264 person-months of TA and short-term training for 70 Egyptian participants were provided.  Yet, training was oriented only toward management-level personnel and consisted primarily of observation tours of U.S. universities and commercial poultry production facilities; no technical training was offered. Planned improvements at 3 GOE breeding/hatching farm were not completed due to a host of implementation delays; the first delivery of imported chicks and equipment did not arrive until late 1981 and installation of new buildings remains incomplete. Phase II accomplishments were also limited.  Plans to expand 3 additional breeding/hatching farms were abandoned due to the delays at the 3 original sites.  Disease control activities which had been programed for GOE farms, intermediate growers, and village producers were implemented only at the GOE farms, and there only partially and after long delays; all that resulted was a study which recommended that a disease control program be initiated at the farms and necessary drugs supplied to carry it out.  Only one Phase II output - a 1-month vaccine/pharmaceutical demand study to determine whether local demand was sufficient to support domestic drug production - was completed. In short, although improvements at the 3 GOE farms will increase their capacity to provide breeding stock, the project's emphasis on imported breeds (which are more prone to disease) - while neglecting village-level disease control - suggest that it will do little to assist small producers.  Consumers will likely benefit from the project, if the imported birds are successfully distributed to large producers, as will the large-scale producers themselves and the scientists at the GOE farms who will be able to experiment with improved breeds.  Small-scale production, however, remains a promising area for future A.I.D. assistance. Annexes include exceptions taken by A.I.D.'s Office of Agriculture to the evaluation conclusions.","Attached to PD-AAQ-603","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Poultry|Eggs|Animal breeding|Agricultural production|Poultry diseases|Disease prevention and control|Experimental farms|Beneficiary interviews","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAQ603A.pdf","1,963 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation|Pre evaluation data|Evaluation team","","Bishop, John P.|Shafik, Nemat T.|Osman, Adly E.","","5 Oct 1983","","","","Evaluation report : poultry improvement project","","XD-AAQ-603-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTg1MzIy","Egypt","2630060"
"Evaluates P.L. 48O Title II school feeding program administered by CARE in Sri Lanka.  Evaluation, focusing on the program's effects on school enrollment, attendance, and drop-out rates, is based on surveys of sample schools. The evaluation team designed a special survey in which the records of 112 schools (59 of which had participated in feeding programs) were sampled throughout 1980; the schools were drawn from 21 regions in 19 of the 24 administrative districts of Sri Lanka.  Simultaneously, the team worked with CARE/Sri Lanka to design a second, independent survey covering 25 schools in 2 districts over a 3-year period; 21 of the latter schools had participated in the school feeding program. Following are the major findings.  (1) Overall, the data suggest that enrollment and attendance in the lower grades is enhanced by school feeding, but that school feeding is not related to the short run decision to attend school on a particular day or given month.  (2) During every month in 1980, attendance in non-feeding schools was higher than in feeding schools.  Moreover, in the data collected by CARE there is no relationship between attendance and the presence or absence of feeding in the schools. (3) Drop-out rates throughout the elementary school grades in feeding schools are somewhat lower than the rates in non-feeding schools.  Using the CARE data, a positive relationship between school feeding and enrollment in the elementary grades is also indicated.  (4) In both the 6th and 7th grades, drop-out rates are higher in feeding schools than in non-feeding schools.  In the CARE data, losses in enrollment between the 5th and 6th grades are lower in feeding schools than in non-feeding schools. It is concluded that although school feeding is important, it is a relatively minor determinant of school attendance and/or enrollment. The survey results could also be attributable to other important factors: (1) Sri Lanka's historical, cultural, and familial incentives to enroll and stay in school, which mitigate against school feeding being a large determinant of attendance and enrollment; (2) seasonal variations, climatic variations between years, and variations by geographic region; and (3) migration patterns, which vary by region and by age of child.  Another useful measure of the effects of feeding may be fluctuations in attendance, which should be calibrated in future studies. It is recommended that a series of small, narrowly defined studies be undertaken with the objective of detecting any possibility that school feeding contributes to the nutrition and/or education of school children.

"Evaluates project to establish a Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) Center for Agricultural Management Development (CAMD) to train MOA middle managers in Egypt.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/80-10/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with USAID/E, MOA, and CAMD personnel and with current and former trainees. While progress has been satisfactory and MOA/CAMD support enthusiastic, CAMD will have to significantly increase its training capacity if MOA middle management training targets are to be met.  Since 1978 1,158 middle managers (vs. a target of 2,000) from 13 governorates (vs. a target of 8) and 2 public sector farming organizations have attended 46 basic, advanced, and workshop courses; 64 women have also been trained (all except 9 have attended courses at the governorates due to cultural prohibitions which prevent coeducational residence at CAMD). The revised, 3-week, basic course is taught in Arabic and stresses problem-solving, communications skills, Egyptian agricultural case studies, etc.; a CAMD organizational development unit has been formed and is currently gathering information on MOA management problems in 2 public sector farms to be used in designing future courses.  Training has been well-received by trainees; MOA supervisors of former trainees have been satisfied as well.  CAMD staff training has included long-term overseas programs for 12 (of a targeted 45) participants and 6 short-term courses conducted at CAMD by Egyptian consultants; none of the planned short-term U.S. training has been provided.  Finally, dormitory and classroom buildings have been completed and plans made for construction of a learning resources center, cafeteria, and expanded audiovisual facility. Despite these accomplishments, CAMD has been hampered by an overall shortage of well-trained staff.  As a result, the research and evaluation unit has been unable to carry out its course development and evaluation functions (the advanced course in particular needs revision as it is merely a review of the basic course); and the planned individualized trainee follow-up consultations have been replaced by group workshops. Ten recommendations are given.","Attached to PD-HAA-536","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural management|Management training|Training centers|Institution building|Beneficiary interviews","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDHAA536A.pdf","2,184 KB","008539 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help Nepal's Department of Agriculture (DOA) strengthen cereal crop research and inititate a cropping systems program (CSP), especially in the hills region.  External evaluation covers 1975-2/83 and is based on document review and site visits. Results are mixed.  The project has successfully strengthened commodity research programs for wheat, rice, and maize; initiated CSP research; and helped to upgrade the DOA's capacity to screen and select improved technologies developed elsewhere for cereal crops.  It has also initiated a pilot production program which has been successful in several locations in mobilizing extension and input delivery services and helping farmers overcome their reluctance to try new technologies (using a ""block"" approach to extend technologies to farmers); minikits used by the program to promote improved varieties and fertilizer use, while not without problems, will be useful in future promotional activities.  Also, most construction activities have been completed satisfactorily (although seed processing units at the major commodity stations are not yet in operation).  Training and the provision of equipment have enhanced research capabilities, but problems (inappropriate equipment, lack of trained staff to operate equipment) remain.  The seed production component in particular has been problematical. Long-term sustainability, however, is in question.  It is not likely that the generation of improved technology, especially for the hills, and its transfer to farmers will be fully realized at project end in mid-1984.  Project designers may have overestimated the strengths of agricultural support services (extension, input delivery, credit, marketing, transport) and underestimated the difficulties of institutionalizing a program as revolutionary as CSP.  CSP is unlikely to survive in its present form unless additional inputs are provided after the project ends; commodity research will need further strengthening, as well. The project has been hindered by the DOA's inability to set research priorities and oversee research-extension linkages and by frequent changes in leadership and policy (at both the departmental and ministerial levels).  Also, the DOA's unattractive career and training prospects have hampered recruitment of socioeconomists needed for the commodity programs; those socioecnomists who are at post are generally not doing work that utilizes their training. Moreover, although CSP has focused its efforts in the hills, most of its benefits are, over the medium term, likely to be centered in the flatlands, which are better endowed in terms of soil, water, and input resources.  All three major commodity stations are located in the flatlands.

"Evaluates Social Marketing Project (SMP), part of the Government of Bangladesh's (BDG) national family planning (FP) program. Special evaluation covers the period 1974-83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with key USAID/B and SMP personnel. The SMP has demonstrated that a strong impact can be made in a low-income, mostly rural, developing country at a very low per unit cost by harnessing a large pre-existing marketing sector, and it has broadened awareness and legitimized discussion of FP in a conservative, predominantly Muslim country.  The SMP distributes more than 25% of the modern contraceptives available in Bangladesh, and accounts for more than 50% of all nonclinical protection provided by the national FP program.  In fact, the entire increase in nonclinical protection since 1975 is due to SMP sales.  In 1983, the SMP was providing 931,000 couple-years of protection, (67% of the national program's condoms, 21% of its oral contraceptives (OC's), and 70% of its spermicides). While condoms continue to dominate SMP sales, the growth rate for OC's is higher than that for condoms, an increase attributed in part to concentrating distribution efforts on graduate doctors and especially on rural medical practitioners who have direct contact with OC users. Added to this are extensive mass media efforts (including mobile film showings) and the educational efforts of the 85,000 SMP retailers.  Even so, there is evidence that effective knowledge and use of OCs may be low; good follow-up advice is essential. The short-term, project-oriented nature of the SMP was acceptable at first, but now because of uncertainty as to the future, recruitment of top-level managers is difficult.  Since the BDG considers the SMP an important part of its family planning program, the project should be institutionalized, long-term A.I.D. funding provided, and emphasis put on market planning and development, a management development system, and a computerized information system.  Other recommendations include addition of more brands of contraceptives over a broad price range to attract various population segments; distribution through graduate doctors of injectable contraceptives; and provision of household medicines and nutritional products for mothers and children.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","388-0050-S-00-3015-00","","1/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Social marketing|Commercial retail sale of contraceptives|Contraceptive prevalence|Beneficiary count","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ935.pdf","5,579 KB","","","008511 - USAID.

"Evaluates OPG to Planning Assistance Incorporated (PAI) to improve the operational capacity of the Lesotho Food and Nutrition Coordinating Office (FNCO).  Final evaluation covers the period 2/81-9/83 and is based on document review and interviews with officials from the Government of Lesotho (GOL) and international agencies. FNCO has made considerable progress in institutionalizing PAI's management by objectives and collaborative planning approach, despite staff and budget constraints and the GOL's failure to define a clear mandate for FNCO.  FNCO has held hundreds of coordinative activities, taking the lead in some, including: school feeding program management and the production of nutrition education kits; World Food Day; the drought program; protective legislation against the marketing of breast milk substitutes; maize fortification; and nutrition surveillance. These activities have, however, been oriented toward projects of other Ministries and this has led to confusion about FNCO's role; failure to develop a program of its own has been one of FNCO's major problems. Although systems for collecting data on nutritional status exist, no such data are being processed or used.  FNCO is heading an interagency committee on nutrition surveillance, but still has far to go in developing research and analytical skills as on-the-job training has been minimal and no indigeneous staff have been trained in these areas continued TA and training will be needed after project completion if results are to materialize from nutrition surveillance.  FNCO survival demands, furthermore, that the GOL upgrade the status of the FNCO to that of other agencies and more clearly define FNCO's decisionmaking authority and operational procedures.  Once the nutrition surveillance system is in place, FNCO should undertake fewer project activities and should use surveillance data to develop a national program focused on issues of food security and food aid.","Attached to PD-AAQ-945","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Nutritional status|Nutrition education|Nutrition surveillance|Government departments|Institution building","Lesotho","","","008569 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase the institutional capacity of the Government of Egypt (GOE) to plan and manage an effective agricultural research system.  Special evaluation covers the period 1/81-6/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project, GOE, and USAID/E staff and with farmers. The project's initial scope was narrowed to strengthening horticultural and agricultural economics research capabilities. A subsequent subactivity focused on research in postharvest food handling, strengthening agricultural information management, and establishing a new horticultural science laboratory. Using a combination of TA, training, technology transfer, and adaptive research, the project made a substantial contribution to increasing agricultural productivity and to improving the research skills of Egyptian scientists.  It also alerted the GOE and A.I.D. to the potential of horticultural cash crops for domestic and export consumption.  The GOE has begun to capitalize on this potential by liberalizing price controls and export regulations on many categories of crops. Although the project's institution building objectives were not fulfilled, the training opportunities and access to research networks and materials which the project has opened to Egyptian scientists may perhaps lead to a more productive Egyptian agricultural research system. Recommendations for immediate action are for USAID/E and GOE to: work out administrative and funding arrangements for continuing project activities through 1984; establish research priorities; reorganize research teams as needed; and, in general, encourage joint Ministry of Agriculture (MOA)/academic research teams. Recommendations for future planning include to:  establish an MOA institutional support structure for project activities; convene a combined international/Egyptian research advisory committee; and consider all types of funding mechanisms for future A.I.D. assistance in the agricultural research sector.  In the long term, USAID/E may wish to establish an international center for horticultural research to increase the visibility of U.S. assistance to Egypt.","Attached to PD-AAR-120","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural development|Agricultural research|Economic research|Institution building|Beneficiary interviews","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAR120A.pdf","2,151 KB","008539 - USAID.

"This survey covers the lessons that have been learned about effective assistance to the developing countries in the three decades since the Marshall Plan. It does so by providing a survey of the literature on developmental assistance and its effectiveness. There are four main parts of the survey: (1) the macroeconomic aspects of the impact of developmental assistance on economic growth, including the relationships between trade policy and development; (2) the microeconomic aspects of development assistance; (3) lessons that have emerged from experience in agricultural and rural development; and (4) case studies of the aid experience in five countries. The study includes the impact of multilateral assistance, bilateral assistance (primarily by the U.S.) and assistance by private foundations. The primary focus of the study is on the impact of development assistance on economic growth, with less attention is given to the impact of assistance on other development objectives. No attention is paid to foreign policy objectives such as the effectiveness of assistance in maintaining a friendly government in power.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the research and extension capabilities of Liberia's Central Agricultural Research Institute (CARI).  Special evaluation covers the period 9/82-9/83 and is based on document review, site visits, interviews with CARI research, administrative, and TA staff, and meetings with representatives of related institutions. Despite initial delays in recruiting a TA team, the team's difficulty in procuring needed equipment, and serious communication problems, CARI is becoming a viable institution. An administrative structure is being built up; several Liberians are now key researchers, and returned participants (289 person-months in the United States) will clearly help the understaffed program.  With government financial support and implementation of this evaluation's recommendations, most project objectives should be achieved. The project suffers from general organizational problems, including slow delivery of government research funds, personnel problems, and slow progress in developing laboratory and extension and agricultural engineering support facilities. Poor cooperation has hindered formation of an overall, multidisciplinary research strategy.  Research itself has been hampered by poor security in field plots and by inadequate facilities and equipment.  While excellent research has been done at the Suakoko branch station, current off-station testing is poorly organized.  Despite project training and significant progress in crop science under three prior donor projects, applied research is very weak in a large number of fields and Liberians are needed for the plant pathology, entomology, and animal science programs. While CARI has developed excellent linkages with international research centers, its almost complete lack of linkages with country extension entities seriously threatens its mission to feed Liberia; Phase II must effect dramatic changes in this area. Recommendations include reorganizing CARI into two divisions (Research Coordination and Extension Liaison); placing seed multiplication and plant and fish propagation activities in the Extension Liaison to permit contacts with county agricultural development projects and extension entities; and boldly pursuing linkages with other Liberian research institutions during Phase II.","Attached to PD-BAO-894","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Agricultural extension|Research centers|Institution building","Liberia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDBAO894A.pdf","2,224 KB","008570 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the ability of Operation Friendship (OpF) to provide vocational and life skills training to youth in greater Western Kingston, Jamaica.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/79-9/83, and is based on review of documents and trainee questionnaires and on interviews with OpF, USAID/J, and other concerned personnel. Despite serious setbacks in construction and the purchase of equipment and materials, project achievements have been significant. OpF now has the capacity to train 70-80 (previously 35) students a year; during this project it trained 209 students in trade skills and family life, and placed 119.  Also, curricula were revised and three new training areas introduced (air conditioning, appliance repair, and lithography).  Trainee motivation toward employment has been extremely high.  The PVO's income rose dramatically from sales of items produced during training (the trade school can be self-supporting at its new level of operations). Project management has been highly satisfactory, although early on there was a significant turnover in key OpF staff, due mainly to the low salaries offered.  Technical and managerial training for mid-level staff is a critical need.  Another is that OpF plan for the eventuality of replacing its charismatic executive director. Replication elsewhere in Jamaica is possible, but it must be noted that OpF's success is due in no small part to its strong director and to the esteem in which the PVO is held in Western Kingston.  Further, OpF offers a service for which a genuine need exists, has wisely remained politically neutral, and is flexible in accommodating to changes in financial fortune and to the needs of socioeconomically deprived youth. Replication efforts should also recall that community participation in construction is not always advisable, e.g., in a community such as Western Kingston, where theft is a survival skill. The project proposal was prepared mostly by USAID/J and consultants, which later created some questions as to ""project ownership.""  For example, USAID/J's role in construction and procurement left little room for OF to exercise autonomy in these areas. USAID/J should make its proposal format less intimidating to local PVO's.","Attached to PD-AAR-399","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Vocational training|Slum areas|Private voluntary organizations|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAR399A.pdf","4,244 KB","008563 - USAID.

"Evaluates subproject to prevent and control infant diarrhea in The Gambia.  Independent evaluation, conducted by Stanford University's Institute for Communication Research, covers the project's first year (1981) and is based on findings from a survey of 800 mothers participating in twenty communities. The campaign's first year has been one of intense, pertinent activity and has resulted in impressively high levels of awareness and behavioral change.  Exposure among the target population to the campaign's print, radio, and interpersonal messages was high.  The usefulness of printed matter was limited by low literacy levels, but with carefully designed materials (e.g., flyers as entry tickets in a ""happy baby lottery"") achieved significant exposure and impact.  An average of 50% of mothers have heard radio spots about diarrheal disease, 47.9% having learned something about caring for children with diarrhea, and women discussed radio messages among themselves in about one third of the cases.  Some 80% of the mothers sampled live in villages with Red Flag volunteers (designated advisors) and know what the flag signifies. Learning of the key content of the campaign - regarding the preparation and administration of water/sugar/salt solution (WSS) for home diarrhea treatment - was not only very high but reflected in adoption and accuracy of performance.  The percentage of women having heard of WSS rose from 52 to 84, and of those with correct mixing knowledge from 0 to 67 (the sharpest rise apparently resulting from the lottery's heavy emphasis on mixing procedure).  There was also a rise in the percentage of mothers treating at home and of those using WSS for this purpose. Learning and application in regard to other campaign content - on causes and signs of diarrhea and dehydration, breastfeeding, personal hygiene, and sanitation practices - were also high, but lower and more variable.  For instance, while diarrhea and dehydration recognition and breastfeeding increased, mothers' ignorance concerning the health hazards of incorrect feces disposal was slower to change. Health status measures show diarrheal morbidity to be high and very seasonal (rising distinctly during the wet season).  More data are needed for meaningful mortality analysis.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSPE-C-0028","","12/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|Child health care|Diarrhea|Oral rehydration therapy|Health education|Print media|Radio|Interpersonal communication|Sampling method|Limited data","Gambia","","","001088 - Stanford University.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the capacity of the Caribbean Family Planning Affiliation (CFPA) and member Family Planning Associations (FPA's) to provide family planning (FP) information and services in the Eastern Caribbean.  Final external evaluation covers the period 7/82-10/83 and is based on document review and interviews with A.I.D., International Planned Parenthood/Western Hemisphere (WHR), CFPA, and FPA personnel. CFPA and WHR (as grantee) have performed in a timely, cost-effective, and professional manner.  CFPA has built its staff capacity and has grown as a regional service organization, earning an enhanced image and the collaboration of other organizations in the Caribbean.  A 95% rate of completion of the work scope is estimated. CFPA has provided a variety of desperately needed FP educational materials to support both service delivery and leadership education in the region.  Several low-cost, culturally sensitive, good-quality videos, posters, pamphlets, flip-charts, etc. were prepared (although better distribution of these items is needed), and several radio programs produced; radio dramas were of doubtful cost-effectiveness, but radio magazines have been influential and inexpensive.  Serious difficulties were encountered in launching regional networking publications, and CFPA discontinued these in favor of placing articles in established publications, distributing special studies, and holding seminars and workshops. CFPA has also provided high-quality regional training and TA services (the success of the former being due largely to the superior abilities of the training experts); both services were low cost and highly valued by recipients.  Technical cooperation among FPA's has been generated as well. Community-based distribution programs implemented by FPA's in Grenada and St. Kitts have attracted a significant number of users (and volume is increasing) and maintained reasonable unit costs.  Neither program charges for contraceptives, however, and no oral contraceptives have been introduced in Grenada. Although the project has clearly had positive results in terms of institutional development, materials production, training, TA, and contraceptive distribution, its impacts on contraceptive use are less easily assessed (due to the emphasis on informational and training activities and the limited exposure to date of the educational materials produced by CFPA); contraceptive prevalance surveys planned for 1984 or 1985 may be helpful in this regard. A draft proposal for project continuation - which calls for, inter alia, more precise outcome measures, expanded management assistance, and closer targeting of educational materials - is included.","Attached to PD-AAT-232","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning promotion programs|Regional development|Associations|Private voluntary organizations","Eastern Caribbean|Grenada|Saint Kitts-Nevis","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAT232A.pdf","2,130 KB","003998 - Johns Hopkins University.

"Evaluates OPG to Lutheran World Relief (LWR) to institutionalize a process to enhance the environment and improve food production and water supplies in 6 widely scattered villages in Tanzania's Singida Region. Mid-term evaluation covers the period 4/81-9/83 and is based on site visits and interviews with project and government personnel and with beneficiaries. The technology originally proposed to achieve project goals - windmills, water storage tanks, cement granaries, buried pot and trickle irrigation systems, and community woodlots - proved technically and financially infeasible, leading to a 1983 project revision.  The current strategy, which has excited the imagination of the participants, focuses on:  (1) improving water supply through self-help construction of shallow wells equipped with hand pumps; (2) training villagers in vegetable gardening techniques and nutrition, and supplying seeds and implements; and (3) introducing afforestation at primary schools to provide fruit, pole, and fuelwood trees to villages.  Each component includes training aimed at institutionalizing the activities, and government officials and technicians are already involved in most project areas. The project staff - a director assisted by Peace Corps and other volunteers on a part-time basis (the staff is currently being expanded to satisfy the project's varied and widespread demands) - has links with over 80 government, church, and local officials. Progress in establishing infrastructure has been slow due to difficulties in obtaining import permits, recruiting staff, and constructing buildings.  Additional problems include the harshness of the region and Tanzania's weak national economy. However, the project is now well underway and promises considerable long-term impact due to the appropriate and replicable nature of its technologies.  An 18-month extension is recommended to enable the 36-48 targeted wells to be completed and the gardening and afforestation programs to be adequately institutionalized. Lessons learned are, inter alia:  (1) windmills are not appropriate for village self-help and should be reserved for areas where deep borehole wells are used and a built-in maintenance capacity exists; (2) multipurpose cement ring technology is not functional; (3) volunteer recruitment was delayed due to lack of project proposal specificity on this point; (4) implementation has been made unnecessarily complex by the choice of such widely scattered villages and by the lack of a local LWR staff person.","Attached to PD-AAU-015","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Wells|Water supply|Integrated rural development|Agricultural training|Gardening|Agricultural inputs|Afforestation|Villages|Community self help|Private voluntary organizations|Beneficiary interviews","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAU015A.pdf","3,720 KB","010486 - Lutheran World Relief (LWR)","","008612 - USAID.

"The team found the government's performance in food policy areas to have ""continued to be good in 1983,"" in particular citing the open market sales wide usage and acceptance as the major mechanism to moderate price increases.  Procurement prices have been increased as appropriate to provide incentives to farmers, although this year extensive procurement was not necessary.  An appropriate relationship was maintained between OMS prices and procurement prices, and procurement prices were announced prior to the planting season, while ration prices remained at or above procurement prices.

"Evaluates project to develop Kenya's renewable energy resources and improve its energy policymaking and planning.  Mid-term evaluation is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with project personnel and covers the period 1980-83. Much of the project remains unimplemented, due to cumbersome Government of Kenya (GOK) and A.I.D. procedures for procurement and disbursement of funds, the length of time required to establish a larger than anticipated administrative infrastructure, and the late arrival of commodities.  The charcoal component was postponed by the GOK, and the community water supply and irrigation program eliminated.  Efforts to develop a LEAP (Less developed country Energy Planning) model for Kenya have resulted in one energy print-out and two trained computer operators, but the model is not yet operative. Components to establish an Energy Development Fund and an Energy Data Bank and Library have made little progress.  Project support for data collection and analysis by the Beijer Institute and Clark University was ambiguously defined in the project design, and the work performed by these institutions has been poorly documented. On the other hand, six agroforestry centers are operating, producing seedlings and engaging in training, extension and research; a component to develop improved charcoal cookstoves and train artisans in their manufacture has been extremely successful, although a year behind schedule, and is saving quantities of charcoal; applied research and demonstration activities have been performed at the agroforestry centers; energy audits and surveys are improving efficient use of petroleum; skills in energy demonstrations and extension are being transferred to GOK personnel; a draft energy policy document has been prepared; and the Ministry of Energy (MOE), through a project-supported contractor, has been providing energy-related technical support to GOK and private agencies.  TA has been effective, although it is four months behind schedule and overburdened by administrative duties. The project's design was suspect in several ways: first, as perhaps best seen by its attempt to both plant trees and install at the MOE a macro-economic model, it was necessary to decide whether the design would address the needs of the rural poor (especially women) or the GOK. Second, and consequentially, the project was too complicated and over-designed for the MOE, a weak agency which has undergone repeated reorganizations, to implement.  Third, the project's rigid time-frame for implementation could not be adapted to the inevitable start up delays.  For these reasons, the project teaches a valuable lesson in proper (and faulty) design.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-08-1091-00-08","","12/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","","Renewable energy resources|Cooking fuels|Cookstoves|Charcoal|Agroforestry|Rural areas|Institution building|Energy policy|Limited data","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAV957.pdf","1,738 KB","000594 - Institute for Development Anthropology, Inc.","","008565 - USAID.
