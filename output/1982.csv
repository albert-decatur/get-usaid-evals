"Evaluates project to decentralize educational planning in Peru. Special evaluation covers the period 1975-81 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with educational administrators. While the project failed to achieve most of its goals -- many of them unrealistic -- due to dwindling financial and political support from the host government, it did facilitate some deconcentration, a necessary intermediate step toward decentralization. The project also improved administrative efficiency and responsiveness, increased regional budget autonomy, and gathered educational statistics. In-country training was the project's strongest feature and exceeded targets; 1,123 people, mostly from intermediate and central levels, were trained.  Provision of typewriters and calculators helped strengthen the planning infrastructure in about 50% of intermediate and 10% of lower level offices.  In addition, two planning manuals, potentially useful elsewhere in Latin America, were produced and 2,660 publications were distributed nationwide. On the negative side, only about 50% of planned participant training was provided; most was short-term and of questionable value.  Only minimal technical assistance was provided due to problems in finding personnel and to shorter than desirable service terms.  As a result, five of six planned research projects were never conducted and data from the sixth project were not used. The attempt to develop a model local planning system was largely unsuccessful but did demonstrate that individualized learning packets are currently inappropriate in Peru. The project also taught that educational projects are very vulnerable to economic and political changes and thus require:  (1) a flexible design; (2) reliance on management located at those levels least subject to flux; (3) initial training of lower-level personnel to carry out new duties; (4) realistic goal achievement indicators; and (5) thorough analysis of the system and constraints within which the project will operate.","Attached to PD-AAL-475|Evaluation period: 1975-1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Decentralization|Educational administration|Educational policy|National level","Peru","","","002636 - Peru.

"Evaluates project to upgrade the Syrian Ministry of Health's (MOH) Technical Health Institute (THI).  Special evaluation covers the period 10/80-1/82 and is based on site visits and interviews with THI, USAID/S, and Medical Services Consultants, Inc. (MSCI) contractor personnel. Progress improved since the evaluation of 10/80.  The THI now has an energetic director, full MOH support, and improved relations with MSCI. There are 420 students enrolled in 2-year THI programs in radiology, pharmacy, laboratory technology, public health, and physiotherapy; five program instructors and 24 teachers are in place; curricula and overviews of each profession were prepared; and compilation of lecture notes for 85 courses -- a priority for the next 9 months -- began.  The MSCI team was in place 10/81, providing 46% of scheduled assistance. Although 24 THI graduates were scheduled for U.S. health training, only 18 had adequate English skills, and only 15 completed the year at Essex Community College in Maryland.  Participants are now spending their second year at Tulane University, Massachusetts School of Pharmacy, or Iowa State University, but a new program must be found for two radiology students dissatisfied with the Iowa program, and a physiotherapy candidate must still be found. Evaluators criticized participants for emphasizing technical training needed for certification in their fields and for private practice rather than acquiring the skills needed for effective service to the THI. All will return 9/82, but the original assumption that they would become THI instructors was overly optimistic.  Instead, the returnees will become tutors and laboratory technicians. Laboratory renovations are complete and commodity procurement funds are 75% expended. It is recommended that: (1) the project be extended at least 1 year to 12/31/83; (2) USAID/S, THI, and MSCI meet regularly; (3) added training be provided in physiotherapy and equipment maintenance and repair; (4) commodity ordering be completed; (5) MSCI assist in equipment installation and maintenance; (6) all books and journals be cataloged for the THI library; (7) orientation be provided to returning trainees; (8) instructional programs and field facilities development continue; and (9) the effectiveness of the new curricula be evaluated.","Attached to PD-AAJ-208|Evaluation period: Oct 1980-Jan 1982","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Training centers|Teacher training|Physical therapy|Participants|Graduate education|Institution building|Pharmacology education|Public health care|Health education|Educational materials|Medical education|Curriculum|Laboratories|Technicians|Technical training|Medical equipment|Beneficiary count|Project change","Syria","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ208A.pdf","2,145 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Evaluation team|Onsite evaluation","","Wiles, John W.|Lennox, Robert W.","","Jan 1982","","","","Joint evaluation of technical health institute","","XD-AAJ-208-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUyNzEx","Syria","2760019"
"Evaluates project to promote dissemination and use of policy-relevant population research.  Special evaluation, attached to four trip reports, covers the period 6/80-8/81 and is based on document review and on site interviews with project staff. Despite delays both within and beyond the control of the contractor, Battelle Memorial Institute (BMI), the basic concept and design of the project appear valid and achievable. Although initial trips have been made to the 10 targeted countries, only the Sudan strategy paper has been prepared; drafts of the others are unduly (7-10 months) late. Agreements on country-specific core projects are complete (i.e., all subcontracts signed) only in Jordan.  The Jordanian subcontractors, as well as those in Peru, Nepal, and Turkey, however, seem appropriate and have selected relevant research topics.  Although topics have not been selected for regional and comparative studies, the six planned briefing books on Ghana, Nigeria, Rwanda, Turkey, Jordan, and Morocco have been completed.  Moreover, significant improvements have been made in the BMI staff -- a new full-time project director was appointed and three senior population specialists were assigned as part-time project advisors. It is therefore recommended that BMI: (1) prepare strategy papers immediately for countries where core projects are now being implemented or planned; (2) continue to assign priority to implementing core projects and expediting completion of subcontracts; (3) devote more senior staff time to developing country strategies, core projects, and dissemination plans and to monitoring project activities; (4) finalize topics for comparative studies soon, giving special consideration to the relationship between women, population, and development; (5) review contract deliverables to ascertain which are feasible over the remaining 18 months and adjust budgeting and staffing accordingly; (6) develop a standard subcontract form which gives host countries the right to distribute and disseminate all research findings; and (7) submit trip reports within 30 days after a trip.","See Analytics: XD-AAJ-063-A-D|Evaluation period: Jun 1980-Aug 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","2/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Demographic research|Sociology research|Population economics|Economic research|Population policy|Population planning|Information dissemination|Information networking|Seminars|Population and demography|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ063.pdf","1,325 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Multi country evaluation|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","Baker, Raymond|Baron, Barnett|et al.","","3 Feb 1982","","","","Evaluation of the population and development project of Battelle Memorial Institute","","PD-AAJ-063","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMjM3","Development Support","9365900"
"Evaluates project, implemented by the American Public Health Association (APHA), to strengthen A.I.D.'s ability to promote, design, implement, and evaluate primary health care (PHC) and family planning (FP) delivery projects.  Special evaluation covers the period 10/79-3/81 and is based on document review, interviews with APHA and A.I.D. staff, discussions with users of project products and services, and visits to health and population agencies in New York and Boston. Regarding the promotional information and education component, two of three planned regional conferences (in Thailand and Togo) and four of six planned workshops (in Jamaica, St. Lucia, Botswana, and Tunisia) have been held; a regional conference in Latin America and two workshops in Asia are planned for 1982. Also, the first of three international conferences was held 2/81 in Calcutta. The quarterly newsletter is well written but its circulation limited; its effectiveness should be reassessed. Sixteen informational packets have been distributed to 150 A.I.D. and non-A.I.D. personnel; however, alternative means of information dissemination should be explored.  The function of the Resource Center needs clarification. Under the evaluation and special studies component, four volumes tracking the status of AID-assisted projects by region were completed, and a summary volume analyzing common problems is nearly complete. Work has begun on 10 global reviews of PHC issues, but their audience and the choice of topics needs clarification.  One special study - on growth monitoring of pre-school children - has been published, and a workshop on community participation was organized in Washington in 11/80. Because the data bank storing information on 300 PHC and FP projects contains old data and is little used, it should be discontinued. In terms of technical advisory services, short-term consultant assistance was provided on request to Mission health and population personnel.  Services have been excellent and in such demand that contractual obligations will be exceeded before the contract ends. It is recommended that the role of the project in relation to various A.I.D. units be clarified and that the project's impact be further assessed.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","1/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Health delivery|Family planning services|Delivery systems|Health care planning|Development project evaluation|Impact assessment|Management information systems|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ009.pdf","4,431 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation","","Cash, Richard A.|Cernada, George P.|et al.","","Jan 1982","","","","Evaluation of work performed by the American Public Health Association for the Agency for International Development","","PD-AAJ-009","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMjM5","Development Support","9365900"
"Evaluates project to promote small rural enterprises in Peru. Impact evaluation covers the period 5/79-2/82 and is based on questionnaires administered to project participants, document review, and beneficiary interviews. The project has enabled the Industrial Bank of Peru's (BIP) Rural Development Fund Program (FDR) to establish an accessible revolving credit fund and to provide technical assistance to small industrial, service, and commercial enterprises.  Small enterprise lending by BIP has grown from 3.4% to 50% of all new loans since project initiation in 1975 and is now institutionalized within BIP.  Survey results of 85 randomly sampled entrepreneurs from 4 of the 19 participating BIP branches now enjoying greater autonomy, indicate success in creating income generation, employment opportunities, and economic development in the Peruvian high sierra.  BIP loans have generated on an annual basis: $60 million in net profits and salaries to owners; $19 million in income to new employees; and $50 million in sales to Peruvian suppliers, a return of three to one. Approximately 15,700 jobs were created or sustained.  Such economic improvements justify continued program support and expansion (although the 1981 fund decapitalization has resulted in more limited lending based on the demographic composition of communities). To improve the program further, it is recommended that the FDR: computerize branches and improve branch filing systems, and its overall management information system; report annually to A.I.D. on the sources and uses of FDR funds in Peruvian soles; include information on sales, profits, and employment in feasibility studies for loan applications; update the credit manual to better serve management; require annual branch reports on all loans disbursed, delinquencies, and defaults; create a mechanism whereby delayed loans may maintain their real value; select a higher proportion of field staff for future overseas training; charge profitable branches for the costs of funds and services provided by the central bank; indicate to sub-borrowers the expected changes in interest rates; provide additional banking services to FDR borrowers and clients with commercial loans; and expand technical assistance to sub-borrowers.","Attached to PD-AAJ-471|Evaluation period: May 1979-Feb 1982","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Business enterprises|Small scale enterprises|Employment|Management information systems|Decentralization|Management|Industrial development banks|credit|Financial institutions|Technical assistance|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ471A.pdf","4,011 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates project to stimulate the development of renewable energy resources in Morocco.  Special evaluation covers the period 11/79-11/81 and is based on document review and interviews with USAID/M and Moroccan project personnel. Progress was hampered by a conflict between USAID/M and AID/W over project focus, the former emphasizing the project's research and development role and the latter viewing the project as a financially viable commercial investment.  Planned project outputs have been only partially achieved.  U.S. training in renewable energy was provided to six engineers; U.S. training for four other engineers is underway. Engineers and other staff also received English lessons.  The director of the Center for the Development of Renewable Energies (CDER) and his assistant received preparation for U.S. training.  Four feasibility and preliminary design studies for three small hydroelectric systems were completed.  Several preliminary schematic designs for a CDER headquarters in Marrakech were completed; construction is to start in the spring of 1982.  A study and preliminary design of wind/solar irrigation pumping stations were also completed. Primary problems which have constrained project progress include administrative and bureaucratic delays within the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM); USAID/M's inexperience in executing a project of this nature; communication failures between the MEM and A.I.D.; lack of continuous project monitoring; MEM and A.I.D. staff changes; and A.I.D.'s insistence on contracting with one firm for all services, despite the firm's lack of experience in some areas. External factors which affected implementation include the MEM's lack of leadership due to its total dependence on A.I.D. for funds, weak logistical support within the MEM, and delays in establishing the CDER's institutional autonomy. To improve project performance, it is recommended that USAID/M: coordinate schedules between A.I.D. and the MEM; provide more technical assistance in the execution of project studies; determine the level of technical assistance needed for project completion; and develop evaluation criteria based on verifiable indicators.  In addition, A.I.D. should follow USAID/M's advice to avoid inadequate contracting.","Attached to PD-AAJ-661","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Renewable energy resources|Energy resource development","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ661A.pdf","576 KB","008579 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to upgrade the Jamaican Ministry of Health's (MOH) ability to provide child health services.  Final external evaluation covers the period 11/77-6/81 and is based on document review, interviews with A.I.D. and project personnel, and site visits. This project suffered the consequences of shifting Government of Jamaica (GOJ) priorities and economic decline during the 21-month lag between project design and start-up of implementation. Planned efforts in health sector information management and manpower development, basic training, and functional analysis were either not realized or reassigned to other donors.  The GOJ expanded the project from a planned pilot area (Cornwall County) to encompass the entire country and failed to allocate P.L. 480 counterpart funds as planned for primary health care (PHC) training and equipment. Given these constraints, inservice training achievements were remarkable.  Two training specialists, one assigned on short notice to Kingston, the other highly esteemed trainer to Cornwall County, worked together to develop inservice training for PHC health center workers. They helped plan workshops for 340 midwives, trained 36 trainer coordinators (25 in Cornwall), and developed regional and parish-level training coordinating committees.  An estimated 925 PHC workers in Cornwall were trained in service delivery/outreach. Support was provided to 100 University of the West Indies medical students interning at rural PHC clinics.  Students also conducted three studies - one, unplanned, on Jamaica's infant mortality rate; the other two identifying health service and training needs in two parishes, the results of which were incorporated into ensuing training.  While the studies could not confirm the effect of project activities on infant health or health services, the two students involved later became health officers in Cornwall. Lessons learned:  beware of long delays prior to implementation and of relying on P.L. 480 counterpart funds; there is no substitute for good people; inservice training is not a panacea for management problems; changes in basic health indices are poor measures of project outcomes; shifting priorities require a flexible response.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Medical education|Primary health care|Pilot projects|Beneficiary count","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ669.pdf","1,106 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Final EOPS|Evaluation team|Onsite evaluation","","","","Mar 1982","","","","Report on the final evaluation of the health improvement for young children project","","PD-AAJ-669","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzNzE5","Jamaica","5320040"
"Evaluates project to promote production of basic food crops in Burundi. Special evaluation covers the period 1980-2/82 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with USAID/B, contractor, and Government of the Republic of Burundi (GRB) personnel. Despite an 18-month delay in starting construction of the seed farm (leading to a $491,000 cost overrun), most inputs are now poised for implementation and the project is moving smoothly toward achieving its outputs. Work on support buildings for the 400 ha Kajondi seed farm started 1/82 and work on the farm itself will commence in late 1982. Nonetheless, the GRB has assigned a staff of 10 professionals and 150 casual laborers to conduct farming operations, and the farm has produced one (1981) crop of buckwheat, maize, lupine, and wheat seed.  Of the 11.5 tons of Romany wheat seed produced, 7.5 tons was turned over to Burundi University's Department of Agronomy for distribution to farmers. The maize crop, of poor quality, was sold as cattle feed; the buckwheat and maize seeds were replanted.  While a green manure and liming program has been developed to address the acidity and aluminum toxicity of the farm's soils, development of production techniques has not begun. Problems arose because three assumptions proved false -- that the European Development Fund would a implement seed distribution project, that construction of the seed farm would begin 6/80, and that technical assistance would be on time. It is recommended, interalia, that USAID/B:  (1) request an additional $280,000 from A.I.D. and $211,000 from the GRB; (2) request a REDSO engineer to inspect construction monthly; (3) hire an administrative logistics officer; (4) provide additional participant training, especially in farm equipment maintenance; (5) order necessary spare parts, especially for the vehicle fleet; (6) study the project's impact; and (7) improve management of the project and, in particular, of the Kajondi seed farm.  In addition, USAID/B, the contractor, and the GRB should prepare an annual plan for planting and seed production and develop an alternative seed distribution plan.","Also attached to PD-AAL-687","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Seed production|Laboratories|Agricultural research","Burundi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ849.pdf","231 KB","008522 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to disseminate agricultural information and related services pertinent to A.I.D. projects. Special evaluation covers a period ending 4/82 and is based on surveys of users of project services. The services offered by A.I.D.'s Department of Information Utilization (DIU) in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the National Agricultural Library (NAL) provide a cost-effective means for disseminating agricultural information. The project is organized around three main services -- Technical Inquiry Service (TIS), AID-UPDATE and AID-COPY, and Special Support Services by the NAL. Based on 45 responses to a survey of 220 possible users, it was found that 64% used TIS more than six times per year and 86% considered the quality of TIS excellent. Users indicated that DIU needs to develop a guide to its agricultural information services as well as a formal system for sharing this information. Analysis of 35 responses to a survey of 200 possible users found that 71% used AID-UPDATE services regularly and that 90% were very satisfied; 95% were very satisfied with AID-COPY. It is recommended that AID-UPDATE and AID-COPY be adequately supported to ensure expansion of service and more precise targeting of users and that an evaluation be conducted in 3 years. Special Support Services provided by the NAL have been very valuable and should be sustained. The evaluator recommends and DIU agrees that the NAL and AGRICOLA, a comprehensive agricultural data base, be the hub of an A.I.D. agricultural information network. DIU should also ensure that data bases produced under A.I.D. projects are compatible with AGRICOLA and should seek adequate forward funding for the project. It is also recommended that: a full-time project manager be hired; priority be given first to Missions and AID/W, then to contractors, other project implementors, the Peace Corps, PVO's, and LDC institutions; the issue of user funding be further studied; a simple feedback form for users be developed and that the resulting data be reported regularly; and that an information specialist participate in designing project evaluation procedures.","Attached to PD-AAJ-962","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Agriculture|Information services|Information dissemination|Information networking|Technical assistance|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ962A.pdf","3,619 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation","","Zweizig, Douglas L.","","1982","","","","Team evaluation report","","XD-AAJ-962-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTU0MDAz","Technical Assistance","9310064"
"Evaluates three projects - the Accelerated Impact Program (AIP), the Improved Rural Technology Program (IRT), and the African Women in Development Project (WID) - which fund quick-impact subprojects. Special evaluation was conducted to assess the proposed FY83 unification of the three projects, covers the period 1976-82, and is based on visits to five African missions, a Peace Corps office, and seven subprojects in three countries. Nineteen missions in non-Sahelian countries have participated in one or more of the projects, and countries with large A.I.D. programs have participated more than expected.  Activities to increase agricultural production have been the most prevalent, followed by those in renewable energy, public health, and rural water supply. Information on achievements is sparse because few subprojects are complete and there has been little reporting to AID/W.  Of the the four completed IRT subprojects, one was abandoned while two others show promise.  While enthusiastically received in host countries, all WID subprojects have had implementation difficulties; most are still salvageable but better information at AID/W is crucial to this task.  Of the 14 AIP subprojects checked, 10 were having implementation problems. A problem common to all three projects was the initial approval process for individual activities; however, this process has recently been modified.  IRT subprojects have been easier to implement because they are smaller in size and geographical scope, and because they are designed to further understanding of appropriate rural technologies in African governments in preparation for more sweeping projects. The authors conclude that there is still a need for the funding flexibility which these three projects afford, and recommend that the IRT be extended 3 years and that a single new project - Development Initiative and Responses (DIR) - replace WID and AIP. DIR should stress quick initiatives to respond to new policy and legislation, while IRT should be strengthened to truly promote greater acceptance of appropriate rural technologies and to provide guidance for more encompassing technology projects.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-1096-00","","3/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Development project design|Development project implementation|Development project evaluation|Rural development|Women in development|Appropriate technology","Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ993.pdf","2,761 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Multi country evaluation|Comparative effect evaluation","","Roush, James L.|Knott, M.

"Evaluates project to support population and family planning (POP/FP) services in Morocco.  Special evaluation covers the period 1976-12/81 and is based on site visits and interviews with officials from the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH), USAID/M, and various FP organizations. The MOPH's commitment to FP is obvious.  Its first major FP service delivery project, the Visite a Domicile de Motivation Systematique (VDMS) pilot project in Marrakech, used paramedical personnel to provide household delivery of FP information and services.  The VDMS was successfully completed within a year of the target date but failed to conduct rural follow-up surveys. The VDMS is being extended to three other provinces but is being redesigned to include four additional basic health services. Considerable attention has been given to training.  In-service training seminars and workshops on FP information, education and communication (IEC) have been conducted, and training has been provided to 55 trainers of itinerant VDMS nurses.  Formal paramedical training is being revised for greater practicality. A National Training Center for Reproductive Health (NTCRH) will open in 1982.  There is need for a country-wide inservice training program for health personnel at all levels and for increased special skills training for provincial and lower-level personnel. Progress in other areas is mixed.  The contraceptive supply logistical system is working well and collection of service statistics has improved, but only 2 of 10 planned FP referral centers have been constructed.  The MOPH is not interested in commercial sale of subsidized contraceptives.  Production of IEC materials by the Moroccan FP Association (AMPF) is progressing well, although behind schedule. The World Fertility Survey and other POP/FP studies are continuing at a slow but steady pace. Although the RAPID program was delivered to the MOPH, it has not received much staff attention. It is recommended that:  A.I.D. continue to support the AMPF and not concentrate exclusively on MOPH activities; planning more closely reflect Morocco's ability to absorb inputs; the expanded VDMS program be monitored closely; and in-country or short-term contractors be used liberally.","Evaluation period: 30 Nov-21 Dec 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","4/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Delivery systems|Pilot projects|Health care|National level|Government departments","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL080.pdf","1,426 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","LeComte, Jean|Labbok, Miriam|Friedman, Jay S.","","12 Apr 1982","","","","Evaluation of the population and family planning support project in Morocco","","PD-AAL-080","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTU0MTI1","Morocco","6080155"
"A.I.D's ongoing rural roads project in western Kenya is designed to provide isolated rural areas with all-weather accessibility to production and social services, largely through a program to identify, construct, and maintain 14,000 kms of rural access roads (RAR's).  This study by an AID/W team details the project's impact to date. Most RAR's were found to be well-constructed and serviceable, but direct economic benefit - apart from the generation of local employment due to the labor-intensive nature of the RAR program (the project's graveling, bridging, and culverting program, by contrast, employs capital-intensive techniques) - was not in evidence.  Pedestrian traffic dominates due to a lack of vehicles and the high costs of vehicle use, while the fixed prices of staples and major commodities prevent buyers/sellers from recuperating transport costs and thus serve as a disincentive to private sector development in isolated areas.  A variety of public service and official-use vehicles are urgently needed to serve such areas.  More positively, the RAR program seems capable of being institutionalized in view of the commitment of both officials and people to labor-intensive methods and a road selection process that begins at the local level. Maintenance activities, especially those of a labor-intensive nature, were found to be successful, but a lack of indigenous engineers threatens long-term maintenance.  Roads built under the Vihiga-Special Rural Development Program already require almost total rehabilitation; an agreement to perform such work during the present project was concluded as a result of this evaluation. Lessons learned are the benefits of the RAR program's labor-intensive and participatory approach and the need to:  promote more effective road use by coordinating other integrated development activities at both the national and local levels; undertake cost and supervisory planning to ensure post-project road maintenance; and resolve the policy causes of the project's current lack of direct socioeconomic impact (an appendix argues for an integrated time-phased strategy).  Lessons of general import for A.I.D.'s Kenya program are also noted. Appendices also include a review of other evaluations of rural roads in Kenya.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Roads|Socioeconomic development|Evaluation|Economic aspects|Agricultural aspects|Development project Evaluation|Impact assessment","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAH972.pdf","1,715 KB","000156 - USAID.

"In 1975 A.I.D. initiated a project to increase the production and nutritive quality of basic crops in Guatemala and to develop the capability of the Institute for Agricultural Science and Technology (ICTA) to generate and promote the use of improved small farm technology. This report describes the project's setting and activities, outlines its impact, and summarizes its lessons. Under the ICTA system, new farm-tested seed varieties and cultural practices acceptable to small farmers were developed for maize, beans, and sorghum and led to increased yields and development of a thriving private seed industry.  In addition, ICTA staff increased both quantitatively and qualitatively (although rigid government salary schedules have led to a high attrition rate among the 10 Guatemalans who received advanced degrees, threatening ICTA's future progress); benefited from expatriate help in its research work and organizational growth; and received dramatic increases in financial support from the government.  ICTA has come to represent a new and innovative model for agricultural research and is now working to share its approach with DIGESA, the Ministry of Agriculture's extension service. Project experience taught:  the benefit of an unconventional approach to generating acceptable small farmer technologies; the importance of sustained USAID/G involvement and of investing simultaneously in human, institutional, and technological resources; A.I.D.'s potential for developing agricultural institutions, its comparative advantage in institution-building projects, and the need in such projects to provide for an institution's support after the project ceases; the productivity of ICTA's linkages to international and U.S. agricultural research centers; the importance of coordinating technology and sociology in small farmer research projects; and the need for special financial incentives to retain ICTA's advanced degree scientists, special feedback information systems to test technology results, and flexibility in project implementation. Appendices treat the evaluation methodology, ICTA's approach to technology development and farmer acceptance of it, the role of improved seed, and ICTA's institutional development.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Agricultural production|Institution building|Varietal research","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ178.pdf","1,076 KB","000156 - USAID.

"The Bicol River Basin Development Program (BRBDP) in the Philippines is important because it melds three themes current in development thinking - a concerted focus on a discrete geographic area; systematic integration of various services down to the farm level; and income redistribution and equitable economic growth.  This report assesses the BRBDP's impact, emphasizing seven A.I.D. projects. The BRBDP to date has had a limited but promising impact.  Much of the first 8 years has been spent building infrastructure (e.g., roads and irrigation systems); designing and starting projects (e.g., agroforestry); training staff (e.g., health workers); and raising resources.  Although institutional coordination is satisfactory, the BRBDP is still too centralized.  Participation has been adequate except at the critical farmer level; efforts to promote private investment have been few and unsuccessful. Additional detailed findings on the impact of roads and irrigation and on the BRBDP's effect on regional development and on institutions are presented. Experience gained under the Program has shown that:  (1) the BRBDP is a viable model and the river basin a suitable unit for integrated area development and that consistent national support is a must; (2) while hyperbole may gain initial support, disappointment and loss of this support may result from the delays and problems which inevitably arise; (3) the concept of integration is more useful as a planning device than as an implementing procedure; and (4) early beneficiary participation is both possible and crucial to success, which is ultimately measured by changing attitudes.  Thus, the authors note that the future success of the BRBDP depends on promoting greater farmer participation, increasing farmers' productivity, and on stronger, more creative leadership from the central BRBDP Program Office. Appended are an overview of A.I.D. assistance to the BRBDP; the scope and methodology of this evaluation; an economic analysis of the Program; a report on the benefits and beneficiaries of the BRBDP; a description of the BRBDP's institutional aspects; selected farmer profiles and a discussion of the importance of participation; and a list of 32 references (1967-81).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Socioeconomic development|Irrigation|Agricultural production|Roads|Rural areas|Rice|Integrated rural development|Impact assessment|Development project Evaluation|Evaluation|Land tenure|Sanitation|Farming systems|Water management","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ179.pdf","2,441 KB","000156 - USAID.

"A.I.D.'s Sederhana project was designed to increase Indonesian rice production by rehabilitating or constructing small, technically simple irrigation systems.  An A.I.D. team visited 29 subprojects (SP's) to prepare this review of Sederhana's impact. The project proved difficult to administer.  Only 52 of 600 SP's completed or underway by June, 1980 had been reimbursed by A.I.D. due to start-up problems, design and construction faults that required work to be redone, and to the Fixed Amount Reimbursement method which allowed payment only after technical certification of completed construction. Nonetheless, the project led to substantial increases in rice production on Java and Sulawesi, confirming the assumption that farmers could make immediate use of additional water.  In Sumatra, however, the production impact was not encouraging, due to adverse environmental conditions and farmer resistance to growing labor-intensive, non-cash crops.  In most SP's, increased production benefited both landowners and permanent tenants, but sometimes affected sharecroppers and landless laborers adversely, as landowning families filled many of the jobs created by the increasingly profitable Sederhana system. Key problem areas were a trade-off between SP quantity and quality due to a highly centralized implementation process, which should be altered to increase participation from the provinces and especially from farmers (whose participation, especially in geographically scattered projects such as Sederhana, is essential); lack of coordination between implementing agencies, a factor essential to the success of any project; and the lack of technical assistance which early on led to costly errors and the failure to build an experienced cadre in government agencies - technical assistance should be increased as the project moves to marginal areas, with a focus on improving local construction and management skills.  The project also demonstrated the need for baseline data to assess a project's progress and the fact that programs such as Sederhana, while they can substantially benefit the rural poor, cannot result in the redistribution of wealth. Appendices include an analysis of the project's irrigation and water management systems and a September, 1979 A.I.D. audit of the project.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigation|Rice|Agricultural production|Rural development|Irrigation system construction|Land reclamation","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ608.pdf","2,964 KB","000156 - USAID.

"In the context of a Government of Korea (GOK) strategy to improve rural life, A.I.D. funded a 1974-80 project to strengthen the GOK's agricultural research (AR) service.  The impact of that project is here reported. Results in the three project areas were mixed.  Training was universally regarded as the most successful component, with the provision of equipment (especially a computer and library materials) of notable, but decidedly secondary importance.  Short-term foreign help was of greater importance than resident help, which was of marginal utility. The project paper was simplistic and somewhat misleading, underestimating current experimental yields and calling for breakthroughs that had already occurred, e.g., development of high-yield varieties (HYV) that helped make Korea self-sufficient in rice by 1975. Concentration on rice led to a deemphasis on other important crops. Thus, while project yield increases may be achieved by their 1984 target date, overall national targets will not be met. In fact, despite yield increases in some crops, hectarage in others have been falling - due to a rigid command structure which prevented the GOK's well-organized extension service from taking precautions, especially regarding new races of blast fungal disease and cold-sensitive varieties, the factors causing, respectively, the 1979 and 1980 crop failures. In sum, the project, while appropriate at the time, was not innovative; the future of AR in Korea will depend on the GOK's resources and political will. Other lessons learned are that:  overstress on achieving targets and too strong a command structure can lead to undue focus on short-term results; an AR program must be continuous and integrate AR, extension, training, agricultural education, and farmer incentives; P.L. 480 can retard AR by deferring improved prices; HYV adoption can have both positive and negative economic effects; technical help should be reviewed prior to a project; ongoing contracts with international AR centers are essential; and the causes of the agricultural successes in Sino-centric societies should be studied. Appendices include six individual reports and a 42-item bibliography (1958-81).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Agricultural production|Rice|Barley|Soybeans|Potatoes|Agriculture|Education|Agricultural extension|Cropping patterns","Korea R","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ606.pdf","2,100 KB","000156 - USAID.

"To improve the analytic quality and policy relevance of A.I.D.'s evaluation of projects carried out by private voluntary organizations (PVO's), this report, based on a review of 75 such evaluations (conducte by A.I.D., third party contractors, and PVO's themselves), discusses key issues in PVO project evaluation. To help evaluators move beyond the rhetoric which PVO's generally use to distinguish their approach from that of large donors (e.g, that it is participatory, targets the poor, and is innovative), the author probes, often by way of questions left unanswered, the features of PVO projects and finds them paradoxical. Participation, for example, often signifies decentralized decisionmaking by local elites, a feature which may or may not benefit the poor (examples are provided) or may benefit them only through the trickle down effect criticized by PVO's themselves. Discussion is given to three aspects of PVO projects which make the poor seem more unreachable than they actually are:  the PVO turns from relief to income-earning efforts and from small to large projects and PVO neglect of women's issues. Although PVO's contrast themselves with the public sector, their efforts partly depend on their various types of relations with host country governments (complementarity, competition, replication, filling in ""unoccupied territory"", takeover by the government, and brokering between government entities and the poor). Evaluators of PVO efforts must determine which relations are operative, whether project success was due to PVO efforts, and instances of impact (e.g., when a PVO project serves as first stage of an effort later amplified by the government).  Although PVO's claim to be innovative, many of their projects fall below the state-of-the art. The innovativeness of PVO small-business credit projects is examined in detail. A discussion of deficiencies in evaluations of PVO projects concludes by noting that evaluations should determine how decisionmaking is being done, who benefits from the project, and what is successful or not, including unanticipated successes.  Key elements to be considered in determining project success are project type, time or place of implementation, and the PVO-government relationship. Appendices include extensive suggestions to evaluators and a 178-item bibliography (1966-82).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Development organizations|Development strategies|Development programs|Development cooperation|Development program evaluation|Agricultural development|Community participation","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ612.pdf","2,520 KB","000156 - USAID.

"From 1972 to 1981 A.I.D. assisted Panama's Department of Environmental Health (DEH) in a program to provide 500 piped water systems and 1,300 handpumps to small villages.  The program was planned to enlist community participation and a commitment to operate and maintain the completed systems.  By 1980 562 water systems had been completed; 26 of these were selected at random for this A.I.D. evaluation. Sixteen of the systems had good records of operation, with effective management, adequate maintenance, and regular collection of fees.  The other 10 were experiencing serious problems, although communities with strong local organizations seemed able to resolve their problems within a year.  Individuals trained to operate and maintain the system and handle simple repairs were found in all the villages visited.  Monthly household charges ranged from 25 cents for gravity systems to $3 for diesel-powered systems.  Few villages had difficulty covering operating costs. Piped water, access to which water was almost universal in the villages visited, was of good quality; was used for drinking, cooking, bathing, and cleaning; and relieved women and girls of the time-consuming duty of gathering water.  In an unintended effect, the systems helped stem rural-urban migration and were clandestinely used to water vegetable gardens and small livestock.  Participation in building and maintaining the systems promoted community initiative and self-reliance.  At the macro-level, the water systems helped reduce rural infant mortality and diarrhea. A survey of handpumps in 8 adjacent villages confirmed DEH estimates that non-use of the handpumps is widespread.  The problem is the failure to require community commitment to pump operation and maintenance and the impossibility of repairing locally the type of pump installed. Reasons for the project's success included the DEH's effective administration and prior experience, use of simple and reliable technology, community participation, adequate water resources, and moderately high rural per capita income.  However, there is a potential for problems due to DEH budget cuts, rising energy costs, and growing improper use of piped water.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Sanitation|Health|Environmental aspects|Rural areas|Pipelines|Water quality|Water supply|Environmental health","Panama","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ609.pdf","1,088 KB","000156 - USAID.

"To provide background information for future A.I.D. agricultural research (AR) policy, this paper summarizes A.I.D.'s past and present AR activity and identifies major issues affecting AR projects. First, major trends in AR over the past 10-15 years are reviewed: the development of new technologies adapted to both adverse and optimal conditions; and greater emphasis on onfarm research, communication between researchers and farmers, support for national AR systems in developing countries, and longer time frame requirements. A review of A.I.D.'s AR experience reveals a changing pattern.  In the 1950's, the belief that adequate technologies already existed made AR a low A.I.D. priority, while congressional restrictions and limited in-house expertise inhibited AR activity in the 1960's.  The 1970's New Directions strategies emphasized other development initiatives.  From 1978 to 1981, however, a new awareness of the lack of appropriate technology needed for food production increases and the success of the green revolution led A.I.D. to increase funding for AR by almost 70% to $143 million, with most of the funds going for mission projects. Next, 131 evaluations of 48 A.I.D. AR projects are reviewed. Standard evaluations were found to focus on inputs and outputs; to provide neither an adequate picture of project performance nor the data needed to compare projects; and to not fully treat problems entailed in doing AR in developing countries, the need for more off-station AR and dissemination of findings. Only the four Impact Evaluations included in the sample measured project effect on beneficiaries.  The documents did, however, reveal several recurring issues in AR projects.  For the 39 regional and mission projects reviewed, these focused on problems in conducting AR and involving farmers in it, AR quality and priorities, construction delays and the time allotted to AR, and inadequacies in inputs and A.I.D. supervision. Issues in the nine centrally funded projects reviewed concerned linkages with host country institutions, performance of long-term staff, project scope and funding, and AR quality. The study indicated the need for more than the standard evaluations of A.I.D. AR projects.  Fourteen appendices include a 246-item bibliography (1963-81) of documents examined for this report.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/SOD/PDC-0227","","5/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Development project evaluation|Agricultural research|Agricultural technology","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ613.pdf","4,536 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the Caribbean Confederation of Credit Unions (CCCU) and its member credit union (CU) leagues to assist affiliated CU's to mobilize savings, provide credit, and implement development and disaster assistance projects. Special evaluation covers the period 6/80-2/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with key project personnel. Although not all planned outputs have been achieved, the project is clearly meeting its fundamental objective of strengthening CU capacity to provide financial services.  Individual CU's have substantially increased their membership, savings deposits, and lending, yielding obvious grass-roots benefits.  At the league level, management and reporting have improved and six of ten planned country development projects have begun (six more are pending); in three leagues, policies and procedures for centralized financial operations have been formulated.  At the regional level, the project has enabled the CCCU to provide effective promotion, resource mobilization, training, and, in particular, technical assistance (TA) to member leagues. The project has benefitted from considerable support from national governments and regional educational institutions and from extensive media coverage. However, the project design was unrealistic in assessing the absorptive capacities and human resource needs of the CCCU and member leagues, as well as the impact of inflation on CCCU costs.  Development of CCCU headquarters is seriously behind schedule, planned CCCU management systems (financial systems in particular) have not been fully implemented, and the CCCU does not yet have legal status in Barbados. A perceived need to demonstrate short-term results combined with inadequate TA provided to the CCCU has resulted in postponement of the project's institutional analysis and development planning phase. It is recommended that the 1982 work plan be revised to focus on completing the CCCU's headquarters system and policy development, country-level institutional analyses, and 5-year development planning. Other recommendations address project management, financial management, budgeting, country development grants, income-generating stategies, resource mobilization, data collection, and the CCCU's legal status.","Attached to PD-AAL-161|Evaluation period: 1-13 Feb 1982","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Credit unions|Institution building|Credit","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAL161A.pdf","6,362 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Evaluation team|Multi country evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","Marion, James P.|Mitchell, Anne H.|et al.","","Feb 1982","","","","Caribbean Confederation of Credit Unions; regional development project; eighteen month evaluation report","","XD-AAL-161-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTU0NTgx","Caribbean Regional","5380035"
"Evaluates project to provide family planning (FP) information and education to LDC's through home economics systems.  Final evaluation, attached to a PES facesheet, covers the full project period, 1972-79, and is based on a review of project evaluations. The project was only moderately successful.  The American Home Economics Association (AHEA) worked with home economists in 39 LDC's, conducting 53 workshops for 3,500 home economists and 53 leadership training programs for 270 economics leaders. Associations and programs were established in eight ""emphasis countries"".  In addition, multi-language curricula (Spanish, French, English, and Arabic) and village-level teaching materials were developed, field tested, and adapted to worldwide use. Extensive training was provided in Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Ghana, Jamaica, Nepal, Panama, Tanzania, and Sierra Leone. A 1977 A.I.D evaluation found that the project was burdened with management and field coordination problems (probably originating from AHEA's Washington headquarters); lacked definition in its country selection process and country programs; and was involved in more countries than its limited resources allowed.  After modifications, including a reduction in country programs, the introduction of a country tier system, and an increased focus on non-formal rural education, the project produced its most successful products - a training guide for field workers and teachers, Working with Villagers, and related source-books, which have been translated into six languages and adapted for nine cultures. However, a 1980 evaluation reported ongoing central management and field coordination problems, and budget reductions eventually forced termination of the project. The project achieved its purpose in four countries (the Philippines, Thailand, Jamaica, and Sierra Leone) and proved useful in several others such as the Gambia, Ghana, Tanzania, and Guatemala.  The project did validate the concept of providing FP information and services through outlets other than clinics or other public institutions.  However, the support grant mechanism may not have been appropriate for an organization such as AHEA which was in need of continuous technical support and monitoring.","Attached to PD-AAL-235|Evaluation period: 1971-1982","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning promotion programs|Household management|Technical assistance|Limited data","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAL235A.pdf","1,477 KB","000249 - American Home Economics Association","","000191 - USAID.

"This report assesses rural road projects in eight countries: Sierra Leone, Colombia, Liberia, Jamaica, the Philippines, Honduras, Thailand, and Kenya. After a short introduction, Part II examines the effectiveness, economic and social impact, other key issues (e.g., local participation) of the projects and makes recommendations for the future. Part III presents working group reports from a rural roads evaluation conference held in 1980, while Part IV discusses the implementation of lessons learned from rural roads evaluations. Overall, although these projects constructed roads that were still in use, many of their designs suffered from overly optimistic estimates of benefits, costs, and completion time. A.I.D. did improve its ability to plan road projects with satisfactory overall economic returns, but economic and social analysis and justification of projects often overlooked agricultural price policies, land tenure problems, weakness of the transport industry, absence of complementary agricultural services, and other critical factors. Further, in the majority of cases, maintenance was neglected because of both donor and host country policies. Developing countries could more easily obtain aid for road construction or rehabilitation than for maintenance and therefore let roads deteriorate until rehabilitation was necessary. Moreover, the engineers who ran highway departments were more interested in roadbuilding, with its greater prestige, than in maintenance. Donors did not often act together in requiring progress in rural road maintenance before funding further construction. Other key findings were (inter alia): (1) new road construction was associated with greater increases in agricultural production than was road upgrading, and contributed to the proliferation of small shops in towns and the expansion of rural markets along new or improved routes; (2) road building usually caused environmental degradation, including deforestation, soil erosion, and declining soil fertility (caused by shortened fallow periods); and (3) rural roads provided easier access for rural people to existing medical services and education, but had little effect by themselves on the expansion of health and educational systems. Although each developing country is unique, there are several characteristics of effective rural road projects. A project should: (1) be carried out by an institution whose principal mission is the construction and maintenance of lower volume rural roads; (2) help enhance the construction and maintenance capacity of the host country institution; (3) work with a host country whose road activities are decentralized to the provincial and local levels; and (4) involve local villages substantially in route selection, construction, and maintenance, and use improved labor-based construction and maintenance to encourage community participation. Recommendations are therefore to: improve the project design process by better preparation of design teams; judge objectives and costs on the basis of experience rather than by referring to other designs; and encourage better host country road maintenance programs, through institutional development and policies that tie construction funds to tangible commitments to maintenance.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Roads|Rural areas|Road construction|Transportation system design|Civil engineering|Road maintenance|Road transportation","Sierra Leone|Colombia|Liberia|Jamaica|Philippines|Honduras|Thailand|Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ607.pdf","4,910 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates sub-projects (SP's) financed under the Rural Sector Grant in Botswana.  Special evaluation covers the period 3/82-3/82 and is based on site visits by a consultant team. Regarding the land use planning and management component, eight Subordinate Land Board offices have been constructed and Land Board offices equipped under the Development of Land Institutions SP, and a Cornell University team completed a detailed, policy-oriented water points/use study in Eastern Botswana. There was less progress under the Implementation of Integrated Land Use Plans SP.  Except in Ngamiland, grant funds have not contributed to district programs to generate land use plans for communal areas.  Also, there is no host government concensus on how local-level land use planning is to be carried out.  It is therefore recommended that information collection and applied research focus more on land use planning; national and district-level seminars on communal land use be funded; and the successful Ngamiland experience be examined. Regarding the agricultural production and incomes component, there has been significant growth in demand for funds to support small SP's but very little monitoring of individual SP's, representing a valuable lost opportunity for the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) to examine the feasibility of decentralized systems for agricultural project identification, design, and implementation.  Drift fencing and vegetable gardening activities have dominated; decentralization activities have chiefly been in the areas of forestry and horticulture.  An SP to reduce agricultural information constraints is pending.  The evaluators strongly recommend greater MOA monitoring of SP's under this component. Lastly, substantial progress has been made under the non-farm income and employment component, mainly through the successful establishment by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry of a cadre of rural industrial officers; there is, however, a shortage of candidates for the program. Efforts to develop a wildlife utilization plan have not paid off.  Also, it has become clear that a more sustained effort on the part of both the public and private sectors is required.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Agricultural production|Land use|Environmental planning|Limited data","Botswana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL315.pdf","3,943 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Watercourse improvements conducted under A.I.D.'s On-Farm Water Management Project in Pakistan have enabled farmers to increase their crop yields and incomes.  This report analyzes the setting, history, and impact of the project. While water user associations were not effectively established, farmer awareness of the importance of mutual cooperation grew, informal mechanisms have been quite successful in maintaining watercourses, and demand for watercourse improvements has risen. However, the project failed to increase district government awareness of the need for on-farm water management and failed to institutionalize a mechanism through which that need can continue to be met.  Moreover, the project design did not address regional differences, baseline data collection and project monitoring were inadequate, and the cost of watercourse improvements exceeded original estimates. Planned precision-leveling of fields to improve water use was not as successful as envisioned due to farmer reluctance to participate and the Pakistani Government's decision to deemphasize leveling.  Nor was extension training of farmers adequately implemented, due partly to competition with an existing extension service as well as to A.I.D.'s use of the fixed amount reimbursement mechanism. Project experience also showed that:  (1) costs could have been reduced and benefits spread wider if farmers had been asked to contribute, as they were willing to do; (2) flexible project design is needed to adapt to local needs; (3) in a cultural setting where community cooperation is not traditional, formal structures must be built to ensure system maintenance; (4) concentrated land ownership can cause small farmers to realize little increase in water; and (5) more attention should be given to planning extension functions, training implementors and extensionists, collecting baseline data, and developing local governmental commitment. Appendices provide sample data; the evaluation methodology; a case study of the project's impact in Sind; and papers on the implications of on-farm water management, the project's economic impact, the socioeconomic impacts of increased income, and the role of honor, power, and rivalry in Pakistani villages.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","On farm water management|Water conduits|Farmer participation","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ617.pdf","7,617 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Despite the increasing importance of health programs, there is little hard evidence that they lead to improved health status. To determine if primary health care is in fact working, this report presents a conceptual framework for evaluating such projects. First, the authors describe the problems related to current health project/program evaluations, including the assumed linear flow of impacts, attribution, feedback and indirect impacts, and time as an important variable in evaluation.  Emphasizing the subtlety and long-term nature of the evaluation process, the authors then develop five concepts:  (1) the use of the economic concepts of investment and consumption rather than such measures as morbidity and mortality to guage final project impact; (2) the importance of context and constraint analysis; (3) the growing claim of recurrent health program costs on national budgets; (4) equity considerations; and (5) the essential importance of a dynamic evaluation system which incorporates the above ideas. Finally, the authors discuss a series of practical issues which must be addressed before any evaluation strategy can be defined, namely, attribution of impact, timing of impact measurement, audience differences, data availability, and information costs. Attached are a 57-item bibliography, a list of generic questions for an economic evaluation of primary health care projects, and a proposed set of measures/indicators for health project evaluation.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Development project evaluation|Development program evaluation","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ619.pdf","1,457 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help Private Agencies Collaborating Together (PACT) provide funding to PVO's for development projects in LDC's. Special evaluation is based on a review of project documents and on visits and interviews at 19 representative projects. By sucessfully funding several excellent and many satisfactory projects (50 in all), providing 171 Support Activity Grants and technical assistance, and supporting conferences and seminars, PACT, an agency with 15 U.S. and 5 LDC members, is successfully fulfilling its obligations.  As to cost-effectiveness, some projects were exemplary, but others less impressive; A.I.D. must further investigate this issue. PACT's presence in the grant process does, as hoped, improve the design and performance of projects, especially those of an experimental kind, as PACT devotes much effort to working with applicants to plan and administer projects. PACT's diverse membership is a resource to be maintained.  Most of the agencies visited were content with PACT's involvement in the funding/assistance process, but conflict was occasionally found, especially with PACT member agencies.  To address these conflicts, the evaluators recommend that:  the fact-finding process which PACT uses with applicants be better focused and more limited; efforts be made to cultivate goodwill between PACT and sponsoring agencies rather than to increase LDC membership in PACT; automatic second and third year funding be permitted; and PACT criteria for projects be refined.  Also recommended is rationalizing the travel and workload of PACT regional representatives. The tenor of the times demands that PACT establish and maintain a closer working relationship with A.I.D. Missions, many of whom wish to control the funding process for all AID-funded activities in their respective countries.  PACT should also promote increased collaboration between U.S. PVO's and LDC agencies. This will not be easy, as LDC agencies appear unenthusiastic about finding U.S. collaborators.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/SOD/PDC-C-0397","","6/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Development project design|Development project implementation|Development project evaluation","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL382.pdf","7,333 KB","000833 - Robert R.

"Evaluates P.L. 480, Title III food for development program in Bolivia. Special evaluation covers the period 5/78-12/81 and is based on a review of project documents, site visits, and interviews with project staff by a contracted team and on beneficiary interviews. Despite the problems noted below, the project is exemplary, exhibiting stellar management, speed, flexibility, local control, and the delivery of a high volume of services to the most deprived.  The Project's Executive Secretariat is respected and is efficiently directing the project's 11 agricultural projects (Wheat Collection Centers, Integral Cooperatives, Colonization Roads, Agricultural Service Centers, Pesticide Control and Plant Quarantine, Rural Development [sponsored by Departmental Development Corporations - DDC], Community Conservation and Forestry, Expanded Agricultural Credit for Small Farmers, Secondary School Scholarships for Rural Students, Rural Development Studies); two nutrition projects (Communicable Diseases and Nutrition Improvement); and 74 subprojects. Campesinos view the project's impact positively, mostly in terms of increased incomes and yields, but also in terms of improved feelings of self-worth, welfare, security, and optimism for the future.  The work of the DDC's has been especially noteworthy, and small projects have been surprisingly productive and cost-effective. Despite its success, the program's continuance beyond 1982 is questionable.  Although internal shortcomings have been identified in four projects (Wheat Collection, Integral Cooperatives, Colonization Roads, and Agricultural Service Centers), the most pressing problems have been external - a 1980 coup and the consequent cutoff in U.S. wheat shipments, the collapse of counterpart funding due to political stability, an inflation rate of 60-90%, two currency devaluations, and USAID/B's failure to authorize the deposit of local currency in interest-bearing accounts, which cost the project $10 million. The principal recommendation calls for the immediate ""unfreezing"" of Title III assistance and a project extension through 12/84.","Attached to PD-AAL-393|Evaluation period: 1979-1981|In: PL-480 Title III","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title III|Food aid programs|Rural development|Beneficiary interviews|Project change","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAL393A.pdf","6,929 KB","001046 - Rural Development Services","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Evaluation team|Onsite evaluation","","Hatch, John K.|Hanralian, Michael S.|et al.","","31 Mar 1982","","","","Evaluation of the Bolivian food for development program : its institutional performance and impact on farmers 1979-1981","","XD-AAL-393-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTY1MzI0","Bolivia","5110522"
"Evaluates project to demonstrate the value of renewable energy in Mali and to strengthen the capacity of Mali's Solar Energy Laboratory (SEL) to foster such development.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/78-5/80 and is based on site visits, interviews with project personnel, and team review of project documents. Although Phases I and II were off to a slow and rough start, performance has improved since late 1980 and is now generally favorable; continuation of the project into Phases III and IV is recommended. Implementation has been slow, particularly in securing long-term technical assistance (TA) and necessary commodities. Management could have been better on the part of all parties - USAID/M, the SEL, Solar Energy Research Institute (the TA contractor), and the Afro-American Purchasing Company (the purchasing agent).  Other Malian institutions have done almost no project work to date. Th survey to collect baseline data also experienced problems. The survey design embodied in the project paper was very ambitious, but the SEL was unable to help draft survey questionnaires and the Institute d'Economie Rurale, designated to supervise the survey, provided poor logistic support in the field.  Nonetheless, the survey furnished a valuable characterization of rural energy use.  Installation of the four early start photovoltaic pumps was delayed 18 months due to lack of attention by USAID/M and the SEL. Prototype development by the SEL is promising but should be redirected on the basis of preliminary results from the survey and technical and economic analyses.  Since pumping water, grinding grain, and farm labor are the most pressing rural needs, emphasis should be on photovoltaics, wind energy, stoves, biogas, and dryers. A total of 25 recommendations are provided regarding the SEL, TA, and the focus of future energy technology work in Mali.","Evaluation period: Apr-May 1982","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Alternative energy resources|Pilot projects","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL385.pdf","10,409 KB","008575 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve primary education in rural areas of the Dominican Republic.  Special evaluation covers the period through 4/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel, teachers, educational administrators, and parents. The project has had mixed success.  School construction has been remarkable - 1,055 classrooms have been built.  The staff upgrading component has been extremely successful with over 86,000 person-hours of training having been provided to 2,366 teachers; positive results are evident in the classroom.  Both in-country and U.S. training have been provided to administrative staff.  Additional classroom teachers have been hired, but art and agriculture teachers are still needed. The educational materials component has been equally successful. Basic materials have been developed and distributed to schools, where they are being used extensively; 210 teachers have been trained in materials preparation; and the project materials development team has received valuable on-the-job training. Development of certain more specialized materials is still lacking. Failure to name a permanent Director of Research has impeded activities under this component.  Baseline data were never collected and the planned achievement testing system has not yet been established; there have been four independent studies approved. Nor is the project's information component functioning well.  A facilities inventory of dubious accuracy has been completed, but planned monitoring surveys have not been conducted and no statistical reports have been published.  Four statistics staff members and four research staff members have received U.S. training. Despite the project's notable achievements in staff upgrading and materials development, project goals will not be met due to serious implementation delays during the first 2 years.  It is recommended that the project be extended so that these goals can be met and that communications, coordination, and support services (transportation in particular) be improved.  Several specific recommendations are made for each project component.","Loan no. 517-V-032","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Primary education|Educational materials|Teacher training|RURAL AREAS|Beneficiary interviews","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL386.pdf","765 KB","008537 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to support development assistance projects utilizing the Sister Cities mechanism in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa.  Evaluation covers the period 1/25/82-6/14/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project participants and beneficiaries. Good progress has been made, although the project has suffered from the lack of specificity in its proclaimed objectives.  The contractor, Sister Cities International's Technical Assistance Program (TAP), has provided grants (from private monies it has raised) to 30 of a targeted 55 projects.  Of these, 67% relate to health needs, 17% to water and sanitation, 13% to vocational training, and 3% to labor relations. Some projects - e.g., health workshops in Jamaica and Kenya and a burn care project in Lesotho which directly benefited at least 1,000 patients and passed on substantial knowledge to medical personnel - were highly successful.  Others, such as a labor/industry communications workshop in Jamaica, did not serve the urban poor.  An environmental engineering project in Kenya has great potential for success. TAP has provided the projects with short-term technical assistance (TA) in needs assessment, and project planning, evaluation, and administration.  TAP has also helped participating cities establish linkages with professional and technical organizations and it has prepared and distributed project summaries and other project materials. However, TAP has not developed a standard reporting system for use by the cities. On-the-Job Training Projects which provide brief U.S. training for LDC municipal administrators and other professionals have thus far played only a minor part in the project; only five have been completed, four of them health-oriented.  Language differences have hampered this component.  Finally, four development assistance workshops have been held in the United States. It is recommended that TAP's mission be more clearly defined, with particular attention to its focus on health projects.  The number of project objectives should be limited.  TAP should be more competitive in its fundraising efforts, should develop a comprehensive system for collecting project management data, and should draft a written strategy for future associations with A.I.D.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0100-C-00-2031-00","","6/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Technical assistance|Development strategies|Urban development|Municipal level|Public administration|Management training","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL405.pdf","5,129 KB","000451 - Druben and Ricci Associates, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation|Evaluation team","","","","14 Jun 1982","","","","Evaluation of town affiliation association IDG; special evaluation, June 14, 1982","","PD-AAL-405","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTY1MzQ4","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","9320100"
"Although the Rahad Irrigation Project in Sudan, partly AID-funded and nearly complete, has been operating for only four seasons, it faces problems which threaten its viability.  This report assesses these problems, the project's impact, and the lessons learned. Designed to maximize use of government investments in Nile water management, to upgrade the living standards of 100,000 herders and farmers, and to produce cotton and groundnuts for export, the project is pursuing full mechanization and 100% intensive rotation of crops. Production is supervised by the Rahad Corporation which controls pricing, marketing, and most decision-making. The Corporation has not coped well with management of a mechanized operation, erroneously perceived labor shortages, and tenant dissatisfaction.  Faced with little incentive to grow cotton, farmers have produced less and are working as day laborers and raising livestock, sorghum, and groundnuts.  Mechanization has further reduced project-generated income and threatens to displace labor.  In addition, limitations on local currency have resulted in the inadequate and unequal provision of educational, health, and other promised services. Among the lessons taught by the project are that:  a policy of 100% mechanization needs more analysis; farmers must be given a role in the decision-making process and be allowed choices; harvest-time labor shortages must be viewed in relation to prevailing wage rates; environmental analyses must be conducted and used in designing and implementing irrigation projects; programs to control water-borne diseases should be designed and funded in irrigation projects; and crop protection techniques should be reviewed prior to project implementation and coordinated with public health officials. Appended are photographs; a list of contacts; a 56-item bibliography (1968-81); and reports on:  the institutional and social effects of controlled resettlement, micro-level management of technical resources, economic analysis of agricultural enterprises, labor/tenant relations, and Sudan's environment and natural resources.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigation|Surface irrigation|Canals|Cotton|Water management|Water resources|Groundnuts|Agricultural equipment|Land tenancy|Farmers","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ610.pdf","6,607 KB","000156 - USAID.

"To assess the operations of the National Technical Information Service (NTIS) in disseminating technical and scientific information throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, a survey, results of which are here presented, was conducted of 99 users of NTIS information in five representative countries (Mexico, Costa Rica, Colombia, Peru, and the Dominican Republic). The report first details the survey's design in terms of selection of sample countries, survey instrument preparation, field testing, data collection, development of a users' hierarchy to categorize data for analysis, and finally, selection of end users to be sampled.  Survey findings are then presented regarding respondent characteristics, access to and frequency of use of NTIS products, usefulness of information, most and least liked aspects of the NTIS program, information utilization, application profiles, Spanish-language materials, publicity through the Applications of Modern Technology to International Development bulletin, other sources of information, and finally technical information needs. Fully 96% of the respondents found the information they received helpful, 22% applied it to research, and 34% used it directly in some manufacturing or building process.  Only 2% of the respondents discarded information unread. Indications are that the information has been used extensively (81% usage rate) both to adapt existing technologies and to generate new ones. Data concerning environmental, energy, industrial, and food production issues were most often requested. Despite several complaints about access, document illegibility and/or obsolescence, delivery delays, and poor understanding of the data base's scope, evaluators found the program to be an effective source of information which is promoting technological change and building technological capacity in Latin America. Evaluators recommend continued program support but, in order to strengthen the ordering process and outreach, the number of NTIS distribution centers should be increased and staff reassigned from ordering to promotion; ordering should be direct from NTIS. Appended are a pre-test interview guide, telephone contact and call record sheets, an interview guide, and interviewer's instructions.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAC-0044-C-00-1048-00","","7/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Information dissemination|Technology transfer|Technical publications|Technological change|Surveys|Interviews|Data collection","Latin America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL209.pdf","1,147 KB","000654 - InterAmerica Research Associates, Inc.","","000114 - USAID.

"Evaluates project for an expanded program of immunization (EPI) to vaccinate 80% of Mauritanian children aged 0-5 against communicable diseases by 1985.  Special evaluation by a Mauritanian/multi-donor team covers the period 7/80-7/82 and is based on document review and site visits. Given local constraints (e.g., dispersed populations), results have been positive.  Of the three regions visited, coverage was best in Gorgol, with 85% vaccinated against tuberculosis (TB) and 76% against measles and with 86% having received the first anti-polio shot. However, only 39% had received the third anti-polio shot and only 29% are completely vaccinated.  In Nouakchott, measles coverage is only 42% - too low to retard endemicity - and only 27% are completely vaccinated. Assaba had the poorest record, with only 16% having received the third anti-polio shot and only 14% completely vaccinated.  Measles coverage was good (52%), although non-heat-stable vaccine proved ineffective in one village (only heat-stable vaccine is now used in Mauritania). Anti-TB injections left scars on only 77% of Assaba children, compared to 92% in the other two regions. Nomads, although constituting 37% of the Assaba population, could not be included in the survey. Major problems include the insufficiency of EPI-Maternal/Child Health (MCH) cold chain coordination and of epidemiological surveillance of target diseases - despite efforts on both counts. Other problems include inadequate regional stocks of injection materials and vaccination cards, the re-use of disposable material, and insufficient personnel and materials in Nouakchott's central organization. Eight recommendations are made to redress the project's shortcomings. As of 8 months afer the evaluation, two week-long seminars had been held for EPI staff on vaccination techniques, mobile team-MCH center cooperation, and EPI reporting; a standardized reporting system was developed for health units; and Mauritania was in the process of establishing a multisectoral health education commission, a plan of studies and ongoing evaluation, and a program to redesign its EPI.","Attached to PD-AAL-551|Summary of original French text","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Immunizations|Vaccines|Child health care","Mauritania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAL551A.pdf","987 KB","008576 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop new approaches to small farmer training at Farmer Training Wings (FTW's) at four Ministry of Agriculture Training Institutes (MATI's) in Tanzania.  Special evaluation covers the period 2/79-3/82 and is based on field visits, interviews with project personnel and beneficiaries, and document review. Although implementation was seriously delayed and the project is 2 years behind schedule, good progress has been made. Survey instruments have been designed at the four FTW's and staff (27) and pre-extension students (398) have been trained to collect, tabulate, and analyze data. Using these data, the FTW's conducted demonstrations in surrounding villages and farmer training programs both in villages and at the FTW's. The number and type of training programs varied among the FTW's; farmer response was enthusiastic, except at the Nyegezi FTW, which for various reasons has the least potential for achieving project purposes. Unfortunately, planned linkages between the FTW programs and research and extension facilities have been weak. The project has also provided U.S. training to six participants. Major problems have been:  differences among the MATI's in interpreting project objectives; impaired staff morale, due to implementation delays; shortage and late assignment of Tanzanian staff; commodity and transport shortages; and the serious shortage of extension agents in Tanzania.","Attached to PD-AAL-553","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-01-1137-00","","5/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Farmer training|Agricultural extension training|Demonstration|Farms|Beneficiary interviews|Project change","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAL553A.pdf","8,730 KB","006434 - Devres, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation|Evaluation team|Logframe change|Interim evaluation","","Hess, Olean|Wesselmann, Robert A.","","25 May 1982","","","","Mid-term evaluation farmer training and production project","","XD-AAL-553-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTY1NzQ5","Tanzania","621011901"
"Because efforts to improve rural water supplies in developing countries have faced increasing criticism and declining donor interest in recent years, A.I.D. in 1979 began a 3-year effort to analyze its experience with community water supply projects. From 1979-1982, 15 projects funded by A.I.D. and other donors in Kenya, Korea, Panama, Peru, Tanzania, Thailand, and Tunisia were evaluated in terms of the water systems' reliability, benefits, and accessibility (i.e., equity). proceedings and recommendations of a 1982 conference held to discuss the results of these evaluations, which were conducted to field test the relevance of the following hypothetical attributes of successful water projects:  host country and community commitment; realistic national goals; financially sound support institutions; coordination of donor support with all project needs; appropriate technology; the presence of complementary health, education, and sanitation activities; and increased availability of clean water. In general, the evaluations found the hypotheses to be verified; indepth discussions of each point are presented.  The participants went on to recommend that:  (1) A.I.D. use both Health Account and Food and Nutrition Account funds for water projects; (2) the issue of water quality be addressed within a project's socioeconomic setting; (3) community interest be guaged early on and projects be designed to be locally self-supporting; (4) strong financial and technical institutions be developed to oversee system construction and maintenance; (5) related training needs be adequately addressed; and (6) special sanitation and education components not be included automatically but on the basis of local need and demand.  Lists of the conference participants and evaluation team members are appended.","Related document: PN-AAV-122|Conference on Community Water Supply (24-28 Jan 1982 :|Marriottsville, MD, US)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Water supply|Rural areas","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ624.pdf","2,923 KB","","","000156 - USAID.

"It is being increasingly recognized that Western-oriented medical systems cannot meet the health care needs of developing countries. This report evaluates a project to create a capability within the Government of Korea (GOK) to plan, conduct, and evaluate low-cost, multi-county, integrated health delivery projects. After outlining the project's setting, design, and implementation, the report focuses on the project's institution building and health care delivery impacts.  Initial progress was considerable.  The Korean Health Development Institute (KHDI) was created to implement health delivery systems in three counties, and a National Health Council was formed to coordinate participating public and private agencies. The KHDI's approach was to introduce a new cadre of multipurpose para-professionals and to improve the professional capabilities of an existing single-purpose cadre.  The two cadres then worked through teams of village volunteers to increase community involvement in health care delivery. By 1978, considerable progress had been made in improving access to health care in the three project areas; the average cost per visit at the most peripheral health unit was $1.90.  Concurrently, physicians' share of the market fell 40-50%.  At the urging of physicians, health paraprofessionals were disallowed from providing services outside their legal scope of practice.  Other significant events also occurred during 1978-80. The number of medical school graduates doubled and more graduates were assigned to rural areas, a comprehensive GOK health insurance program was launched, and per capita income in the three counties grew. As a result, health service utilization fell markedly and the cost per curative visit rose to $3.00. The authors notes several lessons, including:  the riskiness of developing an extra-governmental agency such as the KHDI; the need to anticipate economic impacts of changes in health care policy; the need to perform incentives and contextual analysis of all potential project actors; and the difficulty in determining a project's impact on overall health status.  A postscript addresses the long-term financial impact of the GOK's health insurance program.  Extensive tables, charts, and graphs are contained in the text and in appendices; the latter also includes a 33-item bibliography (1975-81), a report on the current status of health care delivery in Korea, project-related public documents, and other information.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Health delivery|Health workers|Institution building","Korea R","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ621.pdf","1,919 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Niger Rural Health Improvement Project. Special evaluation covers the period 6/78-3/81 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project, USAID/N, and Government of Niger (GON) officials. The project is developing and expanding Niger's rural health system as planned and increased coverage of the rural population by village health teams is largely on target.  However, if expansion of the village health team network increases faster than does the number of supervisory staff, major resupply problems will result.  In-country training is generally on schedule; 1,235 secouristes (41% of target) and 926 matrones (31% of target) have been trained.  Construction of seven new dispensaries and 2 departmental centers is proceeding, but risks becoming a failure due to faulty construction of buildings and foundations and badly conceived water supply and sanitation facilities. The major constraints on the project have been the low level of literacy and education among the rural population, and limited financial and human resources.  The present project time frame unfortunately does not take these constraints into account. It is strongly recommended that the project be extended by up to 24 months.  A total of 66 other recommendations, varying in priority and importance, are made in regard to the following areas:  (1) the project's organizational placement within the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the contractual and organizational relationship of the AFRICARE project to the MOH; (2) changes in policies and practices with respect to specific health services and practices, e.g., malaria control, the Expanded Program of Immunization, treatment of diarrheal diseases, and sterilization of needles and syringes; (3) specific changes in rural water supply and sanitation activities; (4) major improvements in the MOH's health planning and statistics capabilities; (5) administrative and management arrangements for health facility construction and renovation; (6) improvements in development and logistic support activities at all levels; and (7) increases in the scope and pace of already programmed training activities. Following each recommendation are GON comments on it and USAID/N responses to the recommendation and/or the comments.","Attached to PD-AAL-277","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Health care planning|Health policy|Health delivery|Rural areas|Health care","Niger","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAL277A.pdf","7,555 KB","008585 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop fuelwood and alternative energy resources in Central America.  Special evaluation covers the period from late 1979 to 5/82 and is based on document review, visits to the two implementing agencies, the Tropical Agricultural Research and Training Center (CATIE) and the Central American Resources Institute for Industry (ICAITI), and interviews with AID/ROCAP and local officials. The project is on track and should be continued.  CATIE has turned in a stellar performance in the fuelwood subproject (SP), with some targets already met or surpassed. Working with national forestry agencies, CATIE has established demonstration plots in critical areas in Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama and high-quality formal field trials in all countries except Panama; begun a financial and economic study of fuelwood production; produced a large number of publications and reports, including one on the 15 most promising fuelwood species; and maintains a seed laboratory and bank.  The SP's key weakness is the lack of an effective integrated information transfer system. Moreover, current staff and funding levels are inadequate to meet the expected demand for expanded field activities. Given the inherent difficulties involved, ICAITI has performed adequately in the SP to develop prototype alternative energy technologies, although  the evaluators question the SP's value within the Central American context.  Currently, programs to construct domestic and industrial stoves, solar hot water demonstrations, and biogas systems are being implemented or initiated in the five countries (work in El Salvador has not yet begun), although the Panama program will involve only stove construction and the Nicaragua program only stove and solar technologies.  Except for a stove construction manual, however, research results have not been published.  Key shortfalls, all correctable, include lack of a full-time field staff (except in Costa Rica), the abundance of counterpart organizations, failure to adapt project paper targets to regional needs and capabilities, and weak linkage with CATIE. A total of 14 programatic and 9 technical recommendations are provided.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Alternative energy resources|Energy farming|Firewood|Appropriate technology|Rural areas","Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL648.pdf","23,341 KB","001257 - Volunteers in Technical Assistance, Inc.

"Evaluates project to improve the nutritional status of the poor in Bolivia by establishing a multi-sectoral planning, implementing, monitoring, and evaluation system for the Government of Bolivia's (GOB's) National Food and Nutrition Plan (NFNP).  Final project evaluation covers the period 10/1/79-5/31/82 and is based on interviews with project officials, document review, and site visits. Although the project has achieved much, steps must be taken to maintain these accomplishments in the post project period.  Initial emphasis was on establishing a Food and Nutrition Department (DAN - responsible for formulating nutrition policies), a National Food and Nutrition Institute (INAN - responsible for nutrition research), and a National Food and Nutrition System (FFNS).  Within this institutional framework, the project concentrated on implementing 10 basic studies and experimental projects to analyze and resolve Bolivia's nutrition problems; assuring permanent GOB financing of INAN; and designing and implementing in-country training activities to support basic studies and experimental projects. Establishment of DAN, INAN, and NFNS were the project's major achievements, along with the completion of 10 nutrition studies and three experimental projects. The project-funded studies revealed that endemic goiter, infant malnutrition, and Avitaminosis A are major problems, as is a decline in breastfeeding.  To address these problems, the project undertook a national campaign to combat goiter and a mass media nutrition education campaign, added nutrition education to the primary school curriculum, and expanded production and processing of tarhui for human consumption. To maintain the project's achievements, steps must be taken to: strengthen the role of DAN; coordinate all nutrition policies within the NFNS; assure the continued decentralized, semi-autonomous status of INAN; and develop policies and programs, utilizing the information provided by the studies and experimental projects, which actually begin to address Bolivia's nutrition problems.  The basic studies and experimental projects are summarized in 15 annexes.","Contract no.

"Evaluates project to help the Bolivian savings and loan (S&L) system, composed of the central S&L Bank (CACEN) and 12 member S&L associations (Mutuales) increase the provision of low-income housing credit in rural areas.  Special evaluation covers the period 1979-9/82 and is based on document review and interviews at four Mutuales. The project's goal and purpose have been met.  The S&L system has extended its services to low-income rural families and established itself as an efficient and responsive resource.  The Mutuales have hired additional staff to promote the program, low-cost construction designs have been developed, and locally produced materials and supplies are being more extensively used. Since most of the new loans are for improvements, the system has provided substantial support for the country's informal construction industry.  Against targets of 960 home improvement loans averaging $500 in small, dispersed rural communities, 1,600 home improvement loans averaging $2,000 in rural market towns, and 230 or more loans for core units averaging $4,500 in major rural population centers, provision was made, respectively, of 699 loans averaging $525, 2,709 loans averaging $1,597, and 141 loans  averaging $3,766.  Cost of the solutions has been remarkably lower than anticipated. The most serious problem confronted by the project was and is the fluctuation in the dollar/peso exchange rate.  Since it was not feasible to adjust mortgages to recurrent devaluations, (that would require a 680% change) it was decided in 7/1/82 to: introduce a 76% adjustment applied to both the savings and the loan side of the S&L's portfolio; fix interest rates on the current portfolio through 12/31/82 and allow them to rise thereafter; set interest rates at 33-38% on lending operations; at 14-22% on ordinary savings accounts;and at 30% on fixed time deposits.","Contract no.

"Evaluates project to improve LDC credit institution operations by developing methodologies for small farm credit program analysis.  Final project evaluation covers the period 9/77-9/81 and is based on a review of project documents and discussions with project participants. A number of project outputs were achieved.  Three methodologies for analyzing credit programs were developed.  Crop enterprise budgets developed numbered 163 in Honduras and 101 in the Dominican Republic (DR); farm record books were utilized in both countries.  In Honduras, 112 participants completed a course on variable and fixed costs, enterprise budget synthesis, and farm financial analysis; a second course on partial budgeting, present value, grain storage and marketing, and livestock investments was completed by 83 participants.  Training in the DR consisted of eight 3-day courses on budget system methodologies and administration attended by 112 trainees. Colorado State University (CSU) and Oklahoma State University (OSU) prepared 14 project papers; 1,000 enterprise budgets were distributed in the DR, and farm record books and enterprise budgets were widely disseminated in Honduras. Despite these accomplishments, little improvement was made in credit institution operations and project results were not disseminated to other LDC's.  Progress was hampered by CSU's difficulty in locating a host country, by inadequate pre-project design and budget preparation, and by the lack of cost-effective management techniques and a uniform reporting format.  Host country credit institutions were handicapped by frequent personnel changes, liquidity problems, the lack of a profit motive, and low managerial capabilities. The project taught that:  quantifiable goals should be specified; having two equal contractors causes management problems; LDC credit agency solvency goals should be clear before attempts are made to institutionalize new procedures; new ideas are more readily accepted by individuals participating in groups; and that farm record keeping is not a cost-effective data collection method.  It is recommended that: project methodologies be marketed as part of a comprehensive LDC credit institution management and improvement package; applied research projects be initially confined to a small area; and that A.I.D. fund OSU or CSU to prepare a manual summarizing project results.","Cooperative Agreement no.

"Evaluates project undertaken by Alternative Technologies International (ATI) to promote the use of appropriate technologies (AT) in LDC's.  Special evaluation, attached to a PES (PD-AAL-654), covers the period 6/77-12/81 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with beneficiaries. ATI has succeeded in developing a viable organization and program: was reasonably successful in strengthening LDC organizations, especially in regard to alternative institutional mechanisms such as franchising, and in developing and disseminating AT (although some projects visited were failures); demonstrated the potential of grassroots development organizations to promote AT innovation; and produced modest benefits on technology policy. On the negative side, the program, while properly targeted, is not too successful in reaching the poor and is insufficiently concerned with the U.S. private sector.  Benefits from ATI's publication program are few.  More importantly, the unit cost of program functions was higher than planned or necessary (a responsibility shared by ATI and A.I.D.) and the positive and negative lessons learned from the ATI program are not widely shared. To improve the technological aspects of its program, ATI should: create a demand for AT rather than promote it aggressively; improve its use of technical consultants; incorporate more technically trained staff and ad hoc interdisciplinary teams where called for; and limit and make indepth studies of the number of technologies in its portfolio.  On the management level, ATI needs to articulate its charter better; strive to sell itself more actively to its clients (while preserving its current focus on grassroots efforts); and seek a broader base of support. It is recommended that AID/W:  provide future grant funding for ATI field programs to encourage ATI to seek funds from other sources; strengthen its management of the program and in particular provide the policy attention needed if the program is to attain its full potential; relegate responsibility for the ATI grant to the Bureau of Science and Technology's Office of Multisectoral Development; and use A.I.D.'s ""Proposal for A Program in AT"" rather than previous grant agreements in preparing future grants.  An improvement in ATI-A.I.D. communications is also called for.","Attached to PD-AAL-654","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Appropriate technology|Technology transfer|Budgets|Financial resources|Technical assistance|Beneficiary interviews|Project change","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAL654A.pdf","13,340 KB","000188 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen Lesotho's National Teacher Training College's (NTTC's) Instructional Materials Resource Center (IMRC). Mid-term special evaluation covers the period 9/79-3/82 and is based on document review and interviews with staff of USAID/L, NTTC, IMRC and related agencies. Progress - while evident in several areas - has been hampered by staff shortages.  IMRC's staff (3 professionals and 11 technicians) is only half of that required, and as a result, both long- and short-term training have had to be curtailed.  The former, however, has been provided to 6 IMRC/NTTC staff and the latter to 2 IMRC technicians. In-house training has proceeded regularly. IMRC printing jobs (nearly 2,000 separate tasks) have greatly increased, especially those for outside clients; workmanship and service are excellent.  In addition, 8,000 silk-screened charts have been produced for primary schools, and photocopying has been at a high level since acquisition of a new machine.  However, although the silk-screened charts were designed by IMRC and NTTC staff, overall progress in designing instructional materials has been slow.  Also, only limited audiovisual work has been done. These shortfalls have been due primarily to the staffing shortage, which in turn has resulted from the Government of Lesotho's (GOL) freezing of vacant posts and prior lack of interest. Other contributing factors include an initial emphasis on technical, as opposed to design, services; equipment lacks; and departure of the audiovisual advisor, not yet replaced. After a year's delay, the new IMRC facility is complete; staff housing is nearing completion.  Furniture and production equipment will not arrive for months, because of inadequate A.I.D. follow-up and an incompetent purchasing agency. The project faces a major challenge.  As of 4/1/82, the IMRC will no longer be part of the NTTC and it is unclear just where the institution will fit into the Ministry of Education structure. Key concerns are IMRC's ability to manage its own purchasing and accounts.  Thus far, IMRC's 4 expatriate advisors (2 more are due to arrive soon) have played the predominant role in decisionmaking.  Several recommendations are made, among them to extend funding only if staffing and budgetary needs are met by the GOL.","Attached to PD-AAL-657","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Government departments|Audiovisual educational materials|Educational materials","Lesotho","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAL657A.pdf","18,659 KB","","","008569 - USAID.

"The Government of Sri Lanka (GSL) has a long history of food support to its population, aided since 1956 by a P.L. 480 Title I program which has provided some $277 million worth of food - mainly wheat flour and wheat.  This impact evaluation is the first of a series of country P.L. 480-I studies. Title I continued to provide food aid despite wide changes in U.S. policy and in Sri Lanka's political and economic life. Apparently, the commodities did not affect domestic rice production, which increased; the relatively minor production of coarse grains was reduced, however. While the wheat and flour did not reach many of the rural poor - who prefer to purchase rice, using food stamps - its availability may have freed rice for broader consumption.  Groups at high-risk of malnutrition have not received any special benefits. The self-help measures in the Title I agreements have been virtually superfluous because the GSL has on its own pursued sound rural development policies.  At any rate, proceeds from commodity sales were credited to a general account and cannot be identified. On balance, the program has probably contributed positively to U.S.-Sri Lanka relations and has been modestly helpful in relieving U.S. grain surpluses and opening sales possibilities for U.S. firms.  Title I provides Sri Lanka with a significant positive balance of payments and is treated by the GSL as a multi-year resource, although it is programmed annually. An innovative multi-year commitment of food aid which would not require GSL policy reform nor involve Title III administrative costs is recommended. The P.L. 480 experience in Sri Lanka suggests that Title I is policy neutral in its effects, despite attempts to integrate it into overall assistance strategies.  Self-help measures need not be quantified annually when a country's basic policies are sound; if self-help measures must be quantified, an adequate monitoring system is needed. This evaluation also shows that Title I commodities do not have to be consumed directly by targeted groups; it would be well for donors to understand local food demand patterns. Finally, provision of Title I commodities requires detailed analysis of a country's ability to forecast production and consumption.

"Evaluates extension of the environmental education project to rural areas in Costa Rica.  Special evaluation, attached to a PES (PD-AAL-669), is based on document review, and on contacts with personnel of the Costa Rican Natural Conservation Association (ASCONA) through inteviews, meetings (some with Government of Costa Rica personnel), and a workshop. Progress towards most goals has been positive.  Educational materials are being published or produced, including:  (1) 21 issues of the monthly bulletin Medio Ambiente, of which the last six have included 48 articles on environmental problems and programs (but only two articles offered technical data, and information concerning ASCONA affiliates was lacking); (2) 18,500 copies of primary school level books; (3) 650 slides on diverse themes (although not well used as yet); (4) educational shows on radio and TV (although the effect was diminished by failure to use 10 available films and discontinuation of the weekly national radio program); and a variety of publications carrying 87 professional articles.  Over 9,000 posters were distributed; others are needed on pesticide use and garbage disposal. ASCONA's library obtained 135 new volumes but these require formal organization. One regional seminar was held in 11/81; three more are scheduled, and a national seminar remains to be programmed.  Three local painting contests were held, but none were held on the national level, nor were writing contests or architectural design contests held. Neither autonomy of ASCONA affiliates nor institutionalization of fund collection has been achieved.  In the first case, internal organization and administrative requirements have been updated within and between ASCONA and its affiliates, but a legal framework for affiliate membership needs to be developed and affiliate leaders trained, both administratively and technically, to resolve local environmental problems.  In the second case, ASCONA needs to diversify its resource base, e.g., through fund-raising activities and sales tax relief on donations, and the promotion of tourism in the national parks. ASCONA also needs to formalize cooperation between laboratories offering water and air analyses.  Finally, detailed accounting of ASCONA's financial and in-kind resources is needed.","Attached to PD-AAL-669","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Environmental education|Institution building","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAL669A.pdf","7,076 KB","008533 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to upgrade facilities and improve the vocational education provided by the Escuela Anzoategui de Artes y Oficios to the poor youth of Guayaquil, Ecuador.  Final evaluation covers the period 7/80-8/82 and is based on document review and interviews during site visits. Although sufficient progress has been made since the 1980 evaluation - especially in administration - to warrant project extension, there are still many problems.  A local, full-time director has been hired and reorganizing rather than increasing staff has made administration more efficient.  A strong program of administration/teacher training has been developed and a library collection started. Matriculation rose 26.1%, from 447 in 1979 to 564 in 1983, encompassing grades seven through ten and eleven.  However, the student attrition rate has climbed 52.4%, with only 49 of 103 students still remaining in their third year.  This high rate is manifested in all courses: general and auto mechanics, radio and T.V., typing and linotype, off-set printing, cabinet-making, and lathing.  Few students are graduating. Many problems contribute to this lack of success. The curriculum has remained disorganized; no vocational education specialist or market analyst was hired; and only small quantities of educational materials and workshop supplies were obtained.  No student guidance program was established; no special instruction was given to outstanding students to help them form small industries; and no system for work-study or permanent, private sector job placement was attempted.  Finally, no efforts were made to make the school self-sustaining, e.g., through commercial sale of school workshop products. Recommendations addressing each of the above problems are made.  It is also recommended that the facility be more efficiently used by expanding instruction into new fields, including instruction for female family members of the male students, and by adding afternoon hours of instruction.","Attached to PD-AAL-672","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","School buildings|Vocational training|Institution building","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAL672A.pdf","18,847 KB","008538 - USAID.

"Evaluates Catholic Relief Services (CRS) P.L. 480 Title II food aid program in Cameroon.  Special evaluation covers the period through 8/81 and is based on document review, site visits, collection of anthropometric data, and interviews with AID/W, USAID/C, Government of the United Republic of Cameroon (GURC), CRS, and clinic personnel and with beneficiaries. In FY 1981, CRS distributed 2,100 MT of food through missionary and GURC Maternal Child Health (MCH) centers concentrated in Anglophone Cameroon.  Although the annual allocated per beneficiary was increased to 60 kg in FY 1981 (compared to 45.6 kg before FY 1980), an average of only 93 calories per child - 6.6% of daily requirements - is delivered daily, due to delivery shortfalls, low attendance, and family sharing. Thus, while anthropometric data indicate that beneficiaries' nutritional status is somewhat better than that of other children, it is hard to attribute this is to the food program; the data also show that children attending regularly (about 35% of the 70,000 served) are better nourished than those who come only occasionally.  Provision of preventive health services at the clinics has suffered from lack of anti-malarial and anti-worm drugs. At the clinics, individual growth charts for children are not always filled out correctly  nor are they used effectively as a teaching tool for mothers.  Both the completion of individual charts and counseling of mothers are adversely affected by the time required to fill out a master growth chart for all attending children.  The master chart, used only partially by the CRS national office, is not serving its intended purpose of pinpointing geographic areas of need and seasonal problems. Moreover, due to the structured MCH delivery channel and CRS provision of family rather than individual rations, the program does not always reach those with the greatest socioeconomic and nutritional need. Detailed recommendations address the above shortcomings as well such issues as:  the feasibility of future nutritional impact studies; the variance between A.I.D. and CRS policies on reaching the needy; program cost-effectiveness and adminstration; and the expansion, continuation, or phase-out of the program.","Work order no. 1","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace|Food aid programs|Child feeding programs|Growth monitoring|Charts|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Cameroon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL683.pdf","25,313 KB","002526 - Systematics General Corp.","","000086 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to assist the Yemeni Government to increase the capacity of Local Development Associations (LDA's) in the Hajjah and Hodeidah Governorates to plan and implement local development projects. Special evaluation covers the period 6/79-10/82 and is based on a team review of project documents and site visits. The project has had uneven results.  Both participating agencies and counterparts seem frustrated by the project's intangible institution building and technology transfer goals.  In addition, a lack of skilled counterparts and the inability of contractor personnel to speak Arabic have exacerbated dissatisfactions within Chemonics, the Peace Corps, the Confederation of Yemeni Development Associations (CYDA), and the Governorate Coordinating Councils (CC's). In mountainous Hajjah, road projects were initially stressed but after 6 months, excessive costs, inter-group political rivalry, and the project's inability to compensate landowners for right of ways forced staff to redirect efforts toward water projects. Dissatisfied, the Hajjah CC refused to expedite these projects. Unfortunately, the number of planned water projects also had to be reduced because of environmental constraints, the area's dispersed population, and limited matching grant resources.  As a result, only one hand dug well has been completed.  These reductions exacerbated mistrust and induced some to believe that Chemonics (the project contractor) was witholding resources in order to make money from the project.  In the more populous, yet politically concentrated Hodeidah, two water projects were completed; both were economically feasible and had local support. Nonetheless, the completed projects have demonstrated the value of technically sound planning and design.  Training of LDA personnel has also occurred as a by-product of these activities. Some progress has been made in the training of CYDA staff in English and the use of a microcomputer supplied for use of a rural development information system.  This activity, although expensive and time consuming, has been visible and successful. A total of 23 recommendations are presented for action by Chemonics, the CYDA, the Peace Corps, and USAID/Y.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Institution building","Yemen","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL678.pdf","933 KB","008624 - USAID.

"Evaluates project implemented by the Cooperative League of the USA (CLUSA) to help the National Cooperative Development Corporation improve the management and operations of India's oilseed processing industry. Final contractor report, attached to a PES (PD-AAL-694), covers the period 8/78-4/82 and is based on document review, interviews with project implementors, and site visits. Although achievement of targets appears minimal, innovations in production/planning/control, raw material grading/storage, and processing efficiency (three of 10 targeted areas of the management and operations system) substantially improved cottonseed, groundnut, and soybean processing at five model plants.  Full adoption of all project innovations could double the industry's current oil production, but such an eventuality presupposes a very complex technical, managerial, and training process. Training was limited, with only six of a targeted 32 plant managers trained (12 more trainees are anticipated).  The training was not integrated into a system of needs analysis, technical support, and evaluation; no one was trained in the application of all the innovations developed.  A three-volume draft operations manual was distributed, but does not yet include the training material envisioned. Centralized formal employment of trainers/consultants was not achieved, as a proposed National Association of Cooperative Oilseed Processors (NACOP) remained unformed.  This contributed to the project's lack of success in extending innovations to other processing plants.  Other obstacles included the unforeseen need for financing of longer-term studies needed to assess the unique character and needs of each plant. To fully realize the project's potential, it will be necessary to develop and test systems and procedures which have been targeted but not yet fully addressed, as well as three unanticipated systems (procurement planning/financing, planning/maintaining the integration of equipment capacities, and a management synthesis of production planning, technology, and financial planning/management).  Further development and extension of project innovations by providing training and technical support to cooperative processing units will also be needed.  Nine suggestions to improve the project are included.","Attached to PD-AAL-694|OPG no.

"Evaluates project to improve agricultural cooperatives (AC) in The Gambia by training AC managers and members.  Special evaluation covers the period 7/80-3/82 and is based on document review, interviews with project personnel, and field trips. The project is succeeding, although some targets have been missed due to late starting time and limited staff. To date, 40 of 500 targeted AC management personnel, but only 800 of 17,334 farmer members are receiving numeracy training.  The former target may possibly be met, the latter cannot. The target of upgrading AC's in basic marketing and secco organization and management will be transferred to the International Labour Organization (ILO) cooperative management training project. Against an unrealistic target of 50%, only 6% (4,400) of all farmers are being taught the function/role of cooperatives in The Gambia. High priority has been placed on the targets of having 50% of women's pre-cooperatives organized and performing economic activities and 75% of Cooperative Thrift and Credit Societies (CTCS) active members of the Gambia Cooperative Union (GCU), receiving extension services and training from GCU and the Department of Cooperation (DOC).  The target to train 100% of GCU and DOC field staff in the principles of, and have them participate in, numeracy training, is unrealistic, but ILO is committed to this training and CLUSA can do little. The project has taught, inter alia, that:  the Bantaba Discussion Group can be an effective forum for cooperative action; both AC farmers and women are eager to become numerate to help them in daily business; the emergence of women's cooperatives requires a stimulus and women in leadership positions; and AC activities are better organized in areas where leadership is strong. It is recommended to:  extend the project for 1 year; make targets more realistic by using target numbers and not percentages; clarify CLUSA's project objectives for CTCS and the use of Peace Corp Volunteers; add another numeracy advisor to allow the team leader to focus on management, administration, and specific areas of AC Education; continue Gambianization, including overseas training of supervisors and a specific takeover schedule; and conduct the major evaluation at end of the third year.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Farmer training|Agricultural cooperatives|Cooperatives|Management training","Gambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL695.pdf","4,143 KB","008545 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report (8/59-12/81) on a project to establish a Special Agricultural Revolving Loan Fund (Fonds Special Agricole - FSA) to provide credit to Tunisian farmers. The FSA has been successful in achieving its goals and has helped many Tunisian farmers increase production.  FSA management has improved considerably, despite problems encountered during the beginning of the project.  Some 4,500 projects (for a total amount of 5,791,574 Dinars or $12,000,000) have been financed through the FSA by the Banque Nationale de Tunisie (BNT).  Loans, which ranged from 200 to 20,000 Dinars, have been used to purchase agricultural equipment and livestock, construct and improve farm buildings, and expand well drilling, as well as for irrigation, soil conservation, and tree planting projects and for land improvement, poultry, and fishing activities.

"Evaluates project to provide potable water by constructing wells in the Dominican Republic.  Special evaluation covers the period 1/80-5/82 and is based on discussions with project personnel during a visit to USAID/DR. To date, only 526 of the 746 wells dug since drilling began in 8/80 are satisfactory and equipped with handpumps; the other 220 have had to be abandoned.  In addition, poor construction techniques and design, inadequate well testing and site acceptance procedures, and inadqeuate hamdpump maintenance have made 20% of the completed wells inoperable. Excessively high charges by local drillers (eight times higher than in Brazil), combined with the fact that drillers are paid for both successful and unsuccessful wells, have run up project costs. Technical analysis shows that:  groundwater throughout the country's populated regions is probably less than 100 feet; except for some marl deposits, all rock should yield water adequate for groups of homes or small communities; the open space provided in the casing of the wells may be inadequate to permit water to enter the interior of the casing; mud created during drilling tends to seal the pores of water-bearing rock; when encountering low permeability marl, adequate storage within the well bore is needed to permit high rates of production in a short period of time; and project technical personnel have no consistent standard for establishing well depth (generally, wells penetrate the water table by 30 feet) nor consistent well-testing method. Several technical recommendations to improve the number of successful wells are provided.  It is also recommended that: drilling continue even when the hardest rock is encountered; cost-plus contracting be considered, with a full review of contractor's accounting records; consideration be given to obtaining 5-10 Peace Corps geologists to be trained by George Washington University staff to provide technical assistance and supervision; and that the Secretariat of Health and Social Assistance (SESPAS) review the legal requirements for drilling and groundwater extraction and obtain (under pain of withholding of USAID/DR funds) whatever permits are needed.","Order of technical direction no. 97","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSPE-C-0080","","7/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Wells|Water supply|Potable water|Technical assistance","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL701.pdf","1,281 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"Evaluates project to provide consultation and support for the 1980 Worldwide Census Program in the areas of software, hardware, and census data on women.  Special evaluation covers the period 10/78-3/82 and is based on document review, interviews with contractor staff, and site visits. Because the principal contractor, DUALabs, Inc., lacks expertise in LDC women's issues, their state-of-the-art report on census data on women is neither comprehensive nor useful.  The report lacks conceptualization, omits key works, and fails to use indicators on the problems of LDC women.  It is doubtful whether the report can be salvaged; any revision must be extensive and should be undertaken only by a expert on women's indicators.  Moreover, DUALabs has not taken appropriate and cost-effective steps to ensure succesful completion of country-specific reports.  Conferences held by DUALabs were not effective. On the other hand, Delta Systems Consultants, Inc. (DSC), the technical contractor, has ably performed in-country consultations and has contracted outside consultants as necessary; 24 consultation trips have been made, the majority to Latin America and the remainder equally to Africa and Asia.  Software consultation and workshops (especially regarding COCENTS and CONCOR) accounted for 70% of the trips.  DSC's follow-up monitoring of consultations, has, however, been weak and little effort has been made new initiate software enhancements and workshops. DSC has developed three major technical products:  a software inventory report; a hardware feasibility report; and a CONTROL software system, the latter providing on-line data on the administrative progress of censuses and surveys.  While generally valuable, and produced in a cost-effective and timely manner, these products are not without weaknesses.  Dissemination of the inventory report has been inadequate, and the hardware report needs extensive revision, particularly regarding country-specific references.  The CONTROL system was successfully installed and field-tested at the National Institute of Statistics in Lima, Peru.  Dissemination of the system to other LDC's is recommended. Several other recommendations address the above noted-problems.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0027","","8/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Statistical data|Information storage and retrieval systems|Population censuses|Planning|Women in development","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL736.pdf","8,815 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","000186 - USAID.

"Evaluates project implemented by the National Rural Electrification Cooperative Association (NRECA) to promote development of small decentralized hydropower (SDH) projects, generally of 1 MW or less in size, in LDC's.  Special evaluation covers the period 5/80-4/82 and is based on document review, discussions with NRECA and A.I.D. personnel, and USAID reports. The program has made significant progress.  A roster of 100 SDH experts has been developed, and NRECA technical assistance teams have been sent to 12 LDC's, at least half of which are proceeding with SDH programs.  Workshops have been conducted in Quito, Bangkok, and Abidjan, combining theory and practice and involving participants from many countries. Although some presentations have been overly broad and others overly technical, the workshops have been rated very favorably on their provision of information and transfer of technology. However, the NRECA staff's lack of technical education and experience in hydropower has limited its effectiveness; technical reports sometimes lacked necessary information and data - on climate, hydrology, energy use, site characteristics - or adequate project definition and conceptual design.  A well-prepared guide to site identification and prefeasibility studies is needed, and NRECA teams should include experienced experts in hydro engineering and economic analysis.  The methodologies of specific assessments - hydrology, prefeasibility studies, environmental, and country assessments - prepared by NRECA are, with two exceptions, too general to be useful for a specific site and constitute the weakest part of the program. NRECA has developed a proposal for intensive training of LDC engineers at the University of Minnesota's Hydraulic Laboratory, with possible later training in a foreign country with an on-going hydropower program.  Recommendations emphasize the importance of experienced staff and consultants, the need for practical case studies and more participation by U.S. manufacturers and consultants in the workshops, and more specific methodology and technical reports.  While continuing to promote SDH programs, for projects with larger potential NRECA should offer advice on obtaining assistance from experienced U.S. agencies and private firms.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Small scale energy systems|Hydroelectric power plants|Renewable energy resources|Alternative energy technology|Technology transfer|Electrification|Rural areas|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL737.pdf","2,595 KB","000184 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to evaluate and assist LDC family planning (FP) operations research projects.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/79-12/81 and is based on document review and interviews with project and AID/W personnel. Project performance has been uneven.  The quantity and quality of work during the first year was disappointing, but both have since improved. Production of the major project output, a comprehensive review of A.I.D. FP operations research projects, was delayed 3 months. According to the contractor, Johns Hopkins University (JHU), the delay was due to AID/W's failure to identify the review's intended audience; evaluators judge, however, the JHU should have settled this question before initiating such a major expenditure of project funds.  JHU made little attempt to obtain data from sources other than AID/W.  The final version of the comprehensive review was limited to review of community-based distribution systems; according to JHU - but not AID/W - this was done at AID/W's behest.  The value of the review is limited by its failure to make specific action-oriented recommendations.  Final assessment of the document, however, must await feedback from professional readers. Subsequent planned outputs were also delayed, but a strategy paper and two of five planned issue papers have now been submitted and a workshop on FP operations cost-effectiveness has been held, with another workshop planned for 1/82. Dissemination of project products has been substantial and is expected to increase greatly during the final project year.  Technical assistance provided by JHU to ongoing and planned operations research projects in several LDC's has been generally satisfactory although the pattern of conflicting JHU-A.I.D. expectations is also visible in this area. AID/JHU working relationships have improved and successful completion of the project is likely.  It is recommended that JHU provide detailed fiscal accounting, ensure prompt completion of planned outputs, and vigorously attempt to locate FP operations research projects that are worthy of A.I.D. support.  AID/W should consider a no-cost extension to ensure completion of planned outputs and should give thought to coordinating this contract with the health operations research contract held by the Center for Human Services.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0055","","4/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning|Development program evaluation|Technical assistance|Family planning research|Publications","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL738.pdf","7,519 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","000186 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the Caribbean Family Planning Association (CFPA) and its member family planning associations (FPA's) in the Eastern Caribbean provide family planning (FP) information, commodities, and services.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/80-6/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel and public officials. Despite CFPA staffing problems, good progress is being made.  Through its regional information and education (I&E) activities, CFPA has raised its public profile and increased public awareness of the problem of adolescent pregnancy.  CFPA has co-published two studies on teenage pregnancy, produced and disseminated several issues of its quarterly Bulletin and a newsletter, and has placed one FP article in the print media.  Provision of audiovisual materials and equipment to FPA's was delayed due to an CFPA staff member's inexperience, but this problem has been corrected; 3 video programs, 18 projectors, 11 video recorders, 100 fieldworker kits, and thousands of posters, pamphlets, brochures, and imprinted shopping bags have been distributed. Repeated problems have delayed efforts to produce a regional FP radio drama series; this series and a series of analytical radio programs are scheduled for 6/82 broadcast. The St. Vincent and the St. Kitts/Nevis radio subprojects are broadcasting short dramas dealing with teenage pregnancy.  In addition, CFPA has held three workshops on family life counseling for FPA fieldworkers; more fieldworker training is badly needed.  Workshops on video production and communications have also been held.  CFPA has made several forms of technical assistance available to FPA's and cooperation among FPA's has been strengthened. A commodity fund for special FPA needs has seen little use. The Grenada FPA has increased its community-based contraceptive distribution (CBD) outlets to 79 (vs. a goal of 81), serving an estimated 2,000 people; the St. Kitts/Nevis CBD program has increased its outlets from 28 to 40.  Both FPA's have active youth programs. More advertising, improved data collection, and review of the decision not to charge for contraceptives are needed at St. Kitts/Nevis. Key recommendations are that the CFPA emphasize I&E and production of and training in the use of audiovisual equipment.  A.I.D. should assign I&E funds from the Public Sector Population Project to CFPA.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Associations|Family planning promotion programs|Contraceptive distribution","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL739.pdf","5,388 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","000186 - USAID.

"The relatively high prevalence of malnutrition among preschool children in the Philippines is a persistent and serious problem. This evaluation is designed to assess the nutritional impact, cost-effectiveness, and achievments of A.I.D.'s P.L. 480, Title II program in the Philippines and to produce information which will enhance the program's effectiveness. It is concluded that the Maternal/Child Health (MCH) and Day Care programs are effective in combatting the highest priority malnutrition (in children under 6), and so have the greatest nutritional impact (as evidenced by weight gains by beneficiaries), but that School Feeding addresses a lower nutritional priority and does so less effectively. MCH and, to a lesser degree, Day Care were also found to the most cost-effective.  The Food for Work program, while providing positive and equitable community benefits, failed to have a substantial or sustained impact on individual participant households.  More regular delivery of commodities in greater amounts is required for optimum program effectiveness. In future Title II allocations in the Philippines, MCH and Day Care should be accorded the highest priority, followed by the School Feeding and then Food for Work programs until the latter two programs are phased out. Other Child Feeding and Adult Feeding activities lack integrated developmental objectives and should have fifth priority, but on strictly humanitarian grounds. The Snack Food program should have lowest priority, in spite of its revenue-generating potential, since its audience is adequately nourished and more economically advantaged. Lessons learned include the need for better assessment of the long-term impact of supplementary feeding programs and for increased long-term, grass-roots involvement of nutritionists and nutrition planners in Title II decisionmaking.  Experience also suggests that programs covering the family as a unit will be more cost-effective than those benefiting children alone.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Malnutrition|Child nutrition|Food for Peace Title II|Food aid programs|Maternal child health care","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ622.pdf","4,580 KB","008592 - USAID.

"Project IMPACT (Instructional Management by Parents, Community, and Teachers) was implemented in the Philippines to test an approach to primary education which would sharply reduce costs per student without loss of educational quality.  Canada's International Development Research Center funded the project, which was developed by the Center for Innovation and Technology, a branch of the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization.  A.I.D.'s evaluation of the project, based on a review of records and interviews with parents, teachers, and IMPACT officials, is here presented. Under the project, 100 or more primary school students, divided into groups of 5-10, were taught by intermediate (grades 4-6) primary school students using programmed teaching modules under the supervision of professional teachers.  Parents and skilled workers served as community resource persons, and a local primary or high school graduate provided clerical, administrative, and logistic support. Cost-effectiveness studies and academic performance tests indicate that the project achieved its objective.  An added benefit was the greater poise and personal initiative evinced by IMPACT students over their conventional counterparts, possibly as a result of IMPACT's stress on independent study and peer group interaction.  Unfortunately, initial project savings were not used to maintain qualitative levels in subsequent years (e.g., by replacing texts and equipment and repairing school buildings), resulting in declining professional support for IMPACT.  Parents viewed IMPACT as benefiting the brightest students, but as less successful with average students. It is recommended that the Minister of Education and Culture (MEC) assess the first few years' implementation as a basis for a policy decision on IMPACT.  If the result is positive, support should be arranged for the IMPACT schools' unmet needs, preferably using MEC budgetary resources. Regional directors should be encouraged to be more resourceful in implementing this unique education delivery system. Appendices include tables relating cost and academic achievement in IMPACT and conventional schools and a 17-item bibliography (1973-1981).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Primary education|Educational innovations","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL001.pdf","1,488 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates three projects to increase the Government of Tunisia's (GOT's) capacities in agricultural planning, economics, and management education.  Final evaluation covers the period 1967-81 and is based on interviews with project personnel, GOT officials, and participant trainees. Although not all objectives were achieved, the projects have had a noticeable effect on targeted Tunisian institutions.  Under the agricultural planning project, 30 vs. 25 planned completed an M.S. or M.A. and one of 5 planned received a Ph.D. However, due to lack of Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) follow-through in assigning participants and participants' lack of commitment, only five are currently working in the MOA's planning department; seven are working for other MOA units, six work in agriculture-related areas, and as many as 10 did not return to Tunisia. Under the economics education project, 13 of 18 planned participants completed Ph.D.'s and three completed M.S. or M.A. degrees. Of these, six teach in the University of Tunis' (UT's) Department of Economics, two teach at the UT's graduate business school (ISG), and two others are employed by an institute of advanced commercial studies. Under the management education project, 21 vs. 12-14 planned completed advanced degrees; eight are teaching management at the ISG and another advanced institution, four teach elsewhere in Tunisia, and the remainder did not return to Tunisia.  Returned participants in all three fields have had a dominant influence on research methodology and analysis in their institutions. English-language books were provided to the UT library in the three project fields as was a participant who received an M.S. in library science.  However, the UT library lacks important periodicals and reference books and acquisitions have slowed since project completion; student use of books seems limited.  A U.S. business management curriculum was introduced at UT without difficulty, but the U.S. economics curriculum encountered opposition.  The three projects resulted in some notable research publications, although not as many as the participants would have liked. During the later years, relationships between project entities were strained, showing the difficulties which can arise when the host country institutions, contractors, and A.I.D. operate from significantly different perspectives.","Attached to PD-AAL-800","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural development|Agricultural education|Business enterprises|Management|Graduate education|Participants|Economics education|Beneficiary interviews","Tunisia","","","000981 - Pragma Corp.","","008616 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to provide vocational training in the building trades to Lebanese youth.  PES covers the period 8/80-2/82 and is based on a review of statistical records from the YMCA, the implementing agency, site visits, and interviews with trainers, trainees, construction contractors, and Lebanese citizens. The project is ahead of schedule, with some 2,500 students having graduated from 32 training sessions (19 were targeted).  A 1981 survey of five training sessions showed that 385 of the 420 trainees graduated and that the number of dropouts and failures had fallen from 30% in 1980 to 8.3%; interviews confirmed that this was due to the growing seriousness with which the program is viewed.  The fact that 20% of the trainees were under age 16 raises the question of whether the program is encouraging young people to drop out of school. Certain skills such as tiling, electric wiring, and plumbing were preferred by trainees, but convincing reasons for these preferences were not apparent. Several encouraging innovations have developed.  Manual work is increasingly accepted in Lebanon, especially in rural areas, as evidenced by the program's acceptance in Eastern Beirut, and there are surface indications of the participation of women in the program. Split sessions between neighboring towns are increasing in cases in which one town cannot provide the 80 trainees usually required for a session.  The first enterpreneurial seminar for working program graduates was held at Baalbeck and attracted 50 students; a YMCA report described its results as beyond expectations.  The most important development of all has been the rise of a community development spirit in project areas such as Baalbeck, Tibnine, and Howsh Rafka. The program's success seems due to a happy congruence of the innovation (the training program), the innovator (YMCA), and Lebanese culture. The overwhelming acceptance of the program by people of all kinds, which seems due to their eagerness for vocational training, belies the conventional wisdom that introducing innovation into a community breeds negative attitudes.  The only improvement suggested is that training be offered in additional skills, especially agricultural mechanics, machinery maintenance, and home skills for women.  It is also recommended that the project be expanded to cover the entire country and that the YMCA act on the encouraging developments noted above.","Prefaced by project evaluation summary (PES) facesheet: Vocational|training in building trades (PES no. 268-82-01, 15 Mar 1982)|Earlier interim evaluation by same author is appended: Evaluation|of the AID-YMCA vocational training program (Aug 1980)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Youth|Construction techniques|Vocational training|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data","Lebanon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL804.pdf","1,756 KB","008568 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to provide housing and community upgrading for low-income urban Egyptian families.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1978-2/82 and is based mainly on document review and interviews with project personnel. Due to lengthy negotiations with U.S. consulting firms, USAID/E had to extend the project 1 year to mid-1984 and less than 10% of project funds have been expended.  In the Helwan New Community (HNC) sites and services/core unit subproject, major design work is complete and construction of a model housing estate of nearly 200 units is underway. The awarding of the first major infrastructure contract, however, still awaits USAID/E's approval.  In the subproject to upgrade six communities (an instance of the project's occasionally unrealistic design), upgrading has begun in only three, and work is at best incomplete in developing evaluation and finance plans and replicable community action programs and in other areas.  The planned Vocational Training Center has been replaced by community center training programs. Although the Government of Egypt's (GOE) success in lowering the costs of its conventional low-income housing projects seems to make the cost savings projected for the HNC unattainable (a fact which may undermine USAID/E's credibility in future housing policy interventions), the project as designed has several advantages over current GOE housing; for example, the HNC provides ownership and better site planning and both subprojects offer a full range of community services. Two issues demand speedy attention.  USAID/E and the GOE's Joint Housing Program/Project Implementation Unit (JHP/PIU) must agree on the plan for the HNC.  According to USAID/E, inclusion of a three-story vertical core would turn the HNC into a conventional GOE housing project. USAID/E and the JHP/PIU must also reach accord on the extent of USAID/E's technical oversight; JHP/PIU is pressing for greater responsibility over technical issues. Lessons learned are that:  USAID/E should outline its key technical criteria in advance to expedite project implementation and not undermine the JHP/PIU's sense of accomplishment; GOE agencies do not readily participate in a project in which they are not directly involved; and the project will not in itself solve the long-term policy issue of placing the GOE's housing strategy on a more economical footing.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Low cost housing|Urban areas|Slum areas|Urban renewal","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL809.pdf","6,084 KB","000833 - Robert R.

"Evaluates project to help Egypt's Development Industrial Bank (DIB) increase industrial production, especially by the private sector. Special evaluation covers the period 6/76-3/81 and is based on a review of the DIB organization, the Egyptian banking sector, and other factors. The DIB has used A.I.D. funds well to provide medium- and long-term industrial credit, albeit much more slowly than planned.  Although disbursement was to be completed by the end of 1978, to date only 83% of funds have been authorized and only 50% disbursed.  This slowness is due to: A.I.D. procurement regulations; the competitive disadvantage of U.S. products in the Egyptian market; the DIB's failure to promote its services actively and to extend to its clients the full benefit of A.I.D. loan funds (e.g., the DIB offered loans for under 10 years and with a grace period under 2 years when 15-year loans and 3-year grace periods were possible); the DIB's access to other sources of foreign exchange since late 1977; and the large number of cancellations of DIB-approved loans, sometimes by A.I.D., but mostly by borrowers due to changes in the exchange rate which increased the borrower's liability by 75%. Although the DIB has channeled 72.4% of all A.I.D. funds to the private sector against a target of 65%, most of these loans have been made to medium and large enterprises, with small enterprises obtaining lower-rate loans from the DIB's OPEC fund. Further, the DIB's portfolio is highly concentrated in service enterprises, especially hotel and tourist projects; of the $27.8 million authorized, only 40% has gone to manufacturing activities. In other activities, 41 DIB employees participated in a 3/78 staff development training program, and technical assistance seems to have helped improve the DIB's performance in evaluating loan applications - between 1978 and 1980 the amount of loans authorized by the DIB increased 95% and of the amount of foreign exchange loans 157%.  The evaluators noted, however, that the DIB does not recognize the need to train its top managers. Included are specific recommendations for encouraging U.S. investment in Egypt, forming a DIB subsidiary for equity participation training, and providing the DIB with additional technical assistance grants.","Loan no. 263-K-035|Attached to PD-AAL-811.","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Industrial development banks|Private enterprises|Industrial credit","Egypt","","","008539 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to assist the Tanzanian Government (GOT) to introduce integrated range and livestock management systems to Masai herdsmen. Project completion report covers the period 1969-1982; no methodology is given. None of the outputs expected prior to the major revision of the project in 1976 were accomplished nor were they likely to have been in time allotted.  Since 1976, accomplishments have been minimal.  The project was constantly amended - receiving additional funding and inputs and being assigned the task of achieving more numerous and complex outputs and purposes - throughout the 1970's.  Among the reasons for poor project performance were poor coordination between the GOT and expatriate technicians, lack of leadership on the part of the expatriate project coordinators, a vague project purpose, and poor USAID/T support. The most severe shortcomings were the absence of baseline data collection and poor project monitoring. Nonetheless, some accomplishments were made: 36 dams were constructed and 12 others repaired; 30 wells and 60 dips were built; 22 rural veterinary centers were completed and staffed, although not fully equipped; 28 GOT personnel, including six Masai speakers, received overseas training and returned to work for the GOT in the Arusha Region; and a rural training center was completed and brought into operation at Monduli. Since the project ended, some contributions from the project have remained. A majority of borehole and other heavy equipment and the dips are still functional and being used.  The veterinary centers and the Masai workshop in Arusha are still in use but are understaffed and undersupplied. Among the lessons taught by the project are that foreign-made equipment should not be imported without a large supply of spare parts; project design should reflect inherent trends and feasible objectives; modernizing the pastoral system is possible but requires simultaneous improvement throughout the system; and high risk projects should include fall back objectives which still convey substantial benefits.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Range management|Animal husbandry|Livestock|Limited data","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL812.pdf","235 KB","008612 - USAID.

"Evaluates rural sanitation project in Bolivia with a view to reactivating the project (A.I.D. support was withdrawn in 7/80). Evaluation, funded under project 9311176, covers the period 7/77-6/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and discussions with project, USAID/B, and Government of Bolivia (GOB) personnel. Due mainly to limited administrative capability on the part of the GOB's Division of Environmental Sanitation (DES) and inadequate GOB counterpart funding, project implementation prior to the funding freeze was unsatisfactory, with only 6 of 200 planned water systems and 500 of 7,600 planned latrines having been completed, all in the Department of Cochabamba.  In the Department of Chusquisaca, no construction was initiated.  Since the freeze, the DES has made progress in solving its administrative problems, but lack of funding and resultant lack of materials has limited water system construction.  In mid-1981, A.I.D. made an interim loan for material purchases to maintain a minimum level of project activity; 19 water systems have now been completed and 43 are projected by 12/82. Review of available funding indicates that an additional 130 water systems can be funded.  To meet this goal, the DES is proposing four additional field offices in Cochabamba and one in Chuquisaca.  Each office, when fully staffed, will be responsible for building 10 water systems annually.  A contract extension to 6/85 will permit construction of the 130 systems. The following conditions should be met if the project is to be reactivated:  (1) submission by the DES of a revised implementation plan reducing the proposed extension from 4 to 3 years; (2) decentralizion of DES responsibilities and provision of logistic support to DES regional offices; (3) internal DES reorganization to improve its technical, financial, and administrative capabilities (to include purchasing and procurement capability); (4) simplification of the DES information and accounting systems; (5) purchase of additional well drilling equipment, vehicles, and materials; and (6) increased counterpart contribution.","Order of technical direction no. 93","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSPE-C-0080","","8/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Water supply|Rural areas|Sanitation|Waste disposal|Technical assistance|Outdoor toilet facilities","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL646.pdf","7,239 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"Evaluates project to provide rural medical assistance in the Trarza region of Mauritania.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/1/80-3/30/82 and is based on site visits and interviews with community health agents (ASC's), training supervisors, Peace Corps Volunteers (PCV's), and regional health service officials. After 20 months, accomplishments are reasonably on schedule in training health personnel, fielding village motivators, establishing community health committees, and initiating primary health care (PHC) activities in 90 villages.  To date, 98 ASC's selected by the villages have been trained (51% of project total). Community medical kits were replenished in 80% (29 of 36) of Phase I villages and support activities were initiated in the remaining nine villages.  Health training supervisors received intensive intruction in supervision, evaluation, teaching methods, and operations research.  Supervisors made monthly visits to their assigned villages during the first trimester in which ASC's were in use; these visits will be reduced after a year to one every trimester. Project administration was hampered by an over-complicated organization and by personnel absences which required doubling of administrative/health agent duties.  These problems constrained data collection, PCV activities, and analysis of results.  In addition, PCV activities were ill-defined, and the volunteers lacked knowledge of the language and a clear understanding of PHC. Recommendations for overcoming these difficultues include increased attention by the chief district physician; better communication among technical, service, and administrative personnel; more detailed job descriptions for Mauritanian and expatriate personnel; and more detailed expense accounting. USAID/M is urged to define strategies for expanding the project to other regions of the country and for future ASC training. Also recommended is establishment of an ASC training team for each region to train trainers and maintain a cadre of experienced ASC's.  A final version of the ASC training manual should be printed and translated into Arabic; suggested revisions cover diagnosis and treatment of malnutrition, diseases of the skin and cardio-vascular system, techniques for weaning and oral rehydration, ear infection, and intestinal parasites.  Data collection forms and the data storage system should be revised.","English ed.: PN-AAU-580|Evaluation period: 1 Aug 1980-30 March 1982","Special Evaluation","Documents","AFR-0202-C-00-1014-00","","5/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Medical education|Community health workers|Health delivery|Change agents|Rural areas|Training|Health research|Data collection|Educational materials|Teacher training|Manuals and handbooks","Mauritania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL748.pdf","2,994 KB","009024 - Dimpex Associates, Inc.","","000068 - USAID.

"The increasing costs of pesticides and a heightened awareness of hazards associated with their use have led to a search for alternate means of controlling locusts, which are a major threat to agriculture in developing countries.  This paper reports on a study of the feasibility of using the fungus Entomophaga grylli - better known as Empusa or Entomophthora grylli - to control locusts. The paper first provides information on E. grylli's development in host insects and its specificity and then briefly reviews the literature on the fungus.  Next, the methods of pathogen preparation, spore application, and locust treatment used in the study are described for each of the two E. grylli pathotypes.  Findings showed that under laboratory conditions, all African and Latin American locust species tested were susceptible to pathotype I E. grylli. Only two species, Locusta migratoria and Schistocerca piciefrons peruviana, were susceptible to pathotype II.  It is noted that L. migratoria and certain other locust species may be excellent culture vessels for some pathotype II strains and could serve as models for studies of fungal specificity and host resistance.  Attached are references (1934-82) and three tables of experimental data.","Evaluation period: 15 Sep 1981-30 Nov 1982","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","DAN-1406-G-1076-00","","11/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Fungi|Pest control|Insects","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL761.pdf","326 KB","002530 - Boyce Thomson Institute","","","English","application/pdf","","","Soper, Richard S.|Humber, Richard A.|et al.","Crop pests and control","6 Nov 1982","","","","Evaluation of Entomophaga grylli for locust control","","PN-AAL-761","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTY2NjUw","",""
"While primary health care (PHC) strategies have been used with considerable success in small-scale projects, implementation strategies at the regional and national levels are still being tested.  This report reviews 52 AID-funded PHC projects worldwide, identifying major cross-cutting issues and recommending adjustments in program direction. After briefly describing each of the projects, the authors discuss, on the basis of their evaluations, the following subjects:  community participation; health workers; project support; program costs; program evaluation and general program progress; and A.I.D. project design and administration.  In evaluating the projects, attention was given to the PHC approach being used, the project's scale and location, and the stage of project implementation. In general, the authors conclude that many of the projects have successfully established PHC structures, increased accessibility and use of health services, and sensitized governments to PHC needs; however, data are few and too preliminary to judge the impact of these projects on directly improving health status.  References are cited for each project.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","8/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Cost control|Health delivery","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL765.pdf","4,313 KB","001318 - American Public Health Association.

"Evaluates project to improve the nutritional status of infants and pregnant and lactating women in Bolivia.  Final evaluation covers the period 10/1/79-5/31/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project implementors and beneficiaries. Despite four military coups, the project was notably successful.  The Sistema Nacional de Alimentacion y Nutricion (SNAN) was created within the Ministerio de Planeamiento y Coordinacion (MPC) to plan, execute, and monitor nutrition activities.  The Instituto Nacional de Alimentacion and Nutricion (INAN) and the Departamento de Alimentacion y Nutricion (DAN) were formed and became fully functioning. INAN completed 10 of 12 planned nutrition studies - publication of which filled a significant information gap - and three of 13 planned experimental nutrition projects.  These activities revealed that Bolivia's major nutritional problems are goiter, infant malnutrition, and a decline in breastfeeding.  Direct results included a national level anti-goiter educational campaign promoting the use of iodized salt, mass media nutrition education, the inclusion of nutrition curricula in primary and secondary schools, augmented tarhui production and processing, and small animal and fish production. DAN, with a multidisciplinary technical team, has proven its ability to form national nutrition policies and coordinate and financially administer national and regional programs.  Other Government of Bolivia and private entities are collaborating with DAN and INAN in policy formulation and research. Funding for third-country training for SNAN personnel was reduced 75% due largely to A.I.D.'s decision not to finance GOB personnel training after the 1980 coup.  Substantial in-country training on various topics was provided by INAN, DAN, and others to administrators, 1,200 primary and secondary school personnel, and 156 other professionals. Other constraints to the project resulting from the military coups include changing INAN and DAN personnel, unassured continuance of GOB financing upon project termination, and the non-integration of DAN into the MPC and DAN's consequent peripheral status. Recommendations are made regarding the need to formulate nutrition priorities and policies and to reorganize and strengthen SNAN.","Evaluation period: 1 Oct 1979-31 May 1982","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","511-0000-S-00-2009-00","","8/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Health policy|Sector planning|Institution building|Nutrition research|Nutrition improvement|Beneficiary interviews","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL895.pdf","9,399 KB","","","008515 - USAID.

"Evaluates the second Integrated Area Development (IAD) project (Bula-Minalabac Land Consolidation) in the Bicol River Basin of the Philippines.  Special evaluation covers the period 6/81-7/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with USAID/P and Government of the Philippines (GOP) officials. Progress has improved considerably in the last year.  Of eight relevant preconditions set by USAID/P in 6/81 for possible extension of the Project Assistance Completion Date (PACD), seven, including timely GOP budget allocations and satisfactory implementation of the revised irrigation and drainage infrastructure construction schedule, have been or are being met.  Nevertheless, the emphasis on farmer organizational development and training remains basically unchanged, casting doubt on the long-term sustainability of project benefits. This seems due to the priority placed on construction by the Project Management Office (PMO) in response to USAID/P's threat to deobligate a large percentage of the loan unless dramatic progress occurred during the next 12 months, and the PMO's continuing need for technical assistance in the area of farmer development - assistance which was not provided.  The eighth precondition, regarding the GOP's mechanism for financing and administering the completed irrigation system, is under discussion. An unresolved key issue is the proportion of total system costs farmers will be required to pay and the amount of the irrigation fee.  It is recommended that the GOP decide on this issue by 11/30/82. Twenty-eight other recommendations are made, the most important of which are that USAID/P approve the PACD extension to 12/31/83; assign a specific USAID/P staff member to assist and monitor the project's institutional development component; and approve, upon GOP request, the use of project funds for additional short-term consultants to help the PMO design an effective strategy to organize and provide water management training to the Irrigators' Associations. The PMO should design such a strategy with the help of USAID/P-funded consultants and at least three additional PMO full-time staff members, and should be restructured to provide for a smooth transition to the project's operational phase.","Loan no. 492-T-046","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Irrigation|Agricultural production|Land consolidation","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL911.pdf","3,997 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates project to improve the nutritional status of children and mothers in Bolivia.  Final contractor report covers the period 5/77-5/82 and focuses on the last 3 years. In spite of difficulties deriving from the tumultuous political scene - Bolivia had eight Presidents during 9/77-5/82 - the National Food and Nutrition System (SNAN) was created within the Ministry of Planning and Coordination in 7/79 and is institutionalizing a multisectorial, interministerial approach to food and nutrition planning.  A new decentralized structure of committees formed by the Food and Nutrition Department (DAN) began operations in late 1981. SNAN - with support from the National Food and Nutrition Institute (INAN), which began operations in 6/79 - has involved over 40 institutions in nutrition projects.  SNAN/INAN successes have included: development of annual nutrition plans and of programs to reduce goiter, protein-calorie malnutrition, and anemia; promotion of nutritional, low-cost foods; publishing a review of future program policy; incorporation of nutrition education into primary schools; production and use of interpersonal and mass media nutrition education materials; publishing of nutrition studies; and initiation of Title III agricultural pilot projects. SNAN's major weakness - inadequate political and decisionmaking capabilities - has resulted from frequent leadership changes caused by government instability.  SNAN has also been weakened by institutional jealousies, unclear responsibilities, and limited participation by the Ministry of Agriculture in nutrition activities. Following a 7/80 military coup, technical assistance was curtailed and official USAID/B-Ministry contact was forbidden for 1 year, during which experimental projects and studies were given priority over organizational development.  DAN was unable to hold a scheduled short-course on nutrition policy; however, training in nutrition education and use of goiter flip charts was provided to 150 teachers and 1,045 persons, respectively. Long-term training for three participants was cancelled, and short-term training planned for eight Ministerial officials was provided instead to four community-level experimental project personnel. Detailed recommendations are made regarding future nutrition activities in Bolivia.","Evaluation period: Sep 1977-May 1982","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/la-C-1225","","5/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Nutrition improvement|Health policy|Sector planning|Child nutrition|Limited data","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL909.pdf","634 KB","000885 - New TransCentury Foundation","","008515 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to co-finance efforts by U.S. and Philippine PVO's to design and implement subprojects (SP's) benefitting the rural poor. Special evaluation covers FY 1980-82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel and beneficiaries. The project has achieved most of its output targets and has demonstrated the soundness of the co-financing approach and the ability of PVO's to promote rural development.  A follow-on project is strongly recommended. Against a target of 20-30, 21 SP proposals of the 57 submitted have been approved and 15 more are being considered; 75% of the SP's are in line with host government and USAID/P development priorities. Most of the 11 SP's visited were attaining their goals despite unrealistic project design, lack of local government support and community participation, and difficulties in sustaining the SP beyond the grant period.  Direct and indirect beneficiaries of 19 of the SP's are estimated at almost half a million.  Peace Corps Volunteers have played positive roles in two SP's. The project's disbursal rate is only 21%, however, due partly to poor planning by PVO's.  While only 7 of a targeted 10-20 U.S. PVO's have received grants, they received 66% of the $4.644 million expended, 23% going to The Asia Foundation (TAF) alone. The evaluation team vindicates continued support for this controversial PVO, although at reduced amounts.  Six Philippine PVO's, the maximum number targeted, have received grants. USAID/P's maximum flexibility attitude to reviewing SP proposals and making funding decisions has caused confusion among PVO's and project committee members.  To rectify this situation, USAID/P should:  clearly state SP criteria; determine whether its intention is to assist PVO's or advance its own country strategy; review SP proposals within 60 days; have a committee formally review SP proposals with a PVO representative after visiting the SP site and vote whether or not to recommend the SP to the Director; encourage PVO's to submit simpler and shorter-term proposals with a greater chance for immediate impact and to consider incremental funding for larger projects; streamline procedures for registering Philippine PVO's and advancing funds; and intensify technical assistance and training efforts to PVO's.  Standard and specified procedures should improve efficiency and reduce staff workloads.","Evaluation period: 1980-1982","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Voluntary organizations|Rural development|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL794.pdf","7,903 KB","008592 - USAID.

"Evaluates project implemented by the University of Chicago Community and Family Study Center (CFSC) to strengthen population communications and training in LDC's.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/77-10/81 and is based on document review, questionnaires administered to to participants in CFSC workshops, field interviews, and site visits. The CFSC has conducted 14 in-country and regional workshops for 650 trainees from 60 countries and has provided country-specific technical assistance to 10 countries, with special attention to the needs of Guatemala and Egypt.  Country-specific assistance should continue to be provided selectively and on a needs basis.  Due to limited CFSC staff and other commitments, the goal of providing population communications training to the staff of 8-10 LDC universities has not been met; only 8 students were recruited from four universities, none of which has developed a strong population communications training program.  Future efforts in this areas should focus on residency programs for senior personnel from African countries most concerned about population issues. The CFSC has not met many of its own publication goals; many promised items have not yet appeared and the existing backlog probably cannot be eliminated before the current grant extension expires.  It is recommended that the CFSC complete as many 1982 publications as possible, with priority given to completing the Media Monograph Series, especially in Spanish and French, and to updating the textbook for field workers.  The Documentation Service has been of little use and should be included in the Population Information Program's computerized POPLINE service.  The CFSC Field Support Service is not yet fully operative. The CFSC has maintained contact with many key local population communications agencies, but has not kept a record nor issued reports on their activities.  A conference to promote cooperation between such entities has been held and a second is planned for 1982, but activities of this kind seem relatively unproductive and should be excluded from future population communications projects.  The CFSC has conducted 19 summer workshops on the Chicago campus for over 1,400 trainees from more than 80 countries and will soon have admitted 50 students to graduate degree programs. Future project emphasis should focus on training, technical assistance, and publishing activities.","Evaluation period: 27 Oct 1981-12 Feb 1982","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/pha-G-1177","","7/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning promotion programs|Family planning occupations|Medical education|Beneficiary interviews","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL931.pdf","4,319 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","000186 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish a farmers' cooperative in Guatemala to promote domestic and foreign sales of temperate-climate fruits and vegetables.  Special evaluation covers the period 1/81-5/82.  No methodology is stated. The new cooperative, CECOMERCA, is not economically viable, although gross margins did increase during the period 1-5/82, indicating that management is acquiring enough skills to make CECOMERCA viable over the short run.  However, sales volumes dropped by half due to the 6/81 loss of the Nicaraguan market. Further, high costs of sales and operations (204% over budget) are prohibitive over the long run. Shortfalls are due to a variety of causes.  The two participating federations, FENACOAC and FECOAR, made no sustained efforts to recruit vegetable and fruit growers.  Technical requirements of GTQ90,000 capital and 2,000 new members were falsely reported as fulfilled to satisfy legal demands, i.e., CECOMERCA was created without a membership base.  The federations and local cooperatives never disbursed the required GTQ800,000 production credit to local farmers.  CECOMERCA management personnel, selected for loyalty to their respective federations, were not knowledgeable about Guatemalan and Central American produce markets and technical assistance (TA) was ineffective. CECOMERCA, consequently, had no produce marketing specialist and no sales thrust, and received no on-the-job training in cooperative organization, management, and operations.  Moreover, because USAID/G did not effectively monitor the 1979-81 start-up period, the above problems were not recognized in a timely manner. Recommendations are to provide TA to CECOMERCA in order to: (1) develop a membership base of 1,000 dues-paying owner/members by the end of 1984; (2) identify needs and provide local and international short- and long-term training in sales and marketing, financial management, and produce handling and packing.  Additional equipment and facilities procurements should be deferred until the cooperative is solidly viable. Previous losses should be covered with U.S. funds; if the two federations do not release the committed production credit to CECOMERCA, A.I.D. should seek some other institutional base for project continuation.  According to the new budget and operation designs, breakeven is expected in 1985.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural cooperatives|Fruit|Agricultural product marketing|Marketing|Vegetables","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL937.pdf","1,484 KB","008550 - USAID.

"Evaluates three projects to develop, respectively, cadres of trained Tunisian business managers, economists, and agro-economists.  Special evaluation covers the period 1970-1981 and is based on interviews, field visits, and document analysis. All three projects are on track. Thanks to U.S. consultants and teaching methods and to Tunisian Ph.D.'s, the Higher Institute of Administration has acquired a solid reputation in Tunisia and has graduated young business managers who are much in demand. There are currently 888 students in three programs (bachelor, graduate, and M.B.A.). Of the 18 University of Tunis econoimics students trained in the United States, 8 received Ph.D.'s and now teach in the Faculty of Law and Economic Sciences, blending the French (theoretical and ideological) and U.S. (quantitative and analytical) approaches to economics. Of 30 U.S.-trained agro-economists (two-thirds of them from the Ministry of Agriculture), 27 obtained M.S. degrees in Agricultural Economics.  Returning students benefitted from a statistical analysis and planning structure devised by University of Minnesota consultants, including cereal production, irrigation, agricultural credit, and annual plans for decision-making.  Since 1975, a country-wide data collection system has for the first time provided adequate seasonal statistics for agricultural planning.  The planning itself has been hampered by the departure of trained teams to the United States, either for Ph.D. degrees or for higher paying jobs. Half of the trainees obtained positions developed by the program or similar positions. One student out of five works overseas and one out of six in Tunisia; nearly one-tenth are still studying. The students interviewed were satisfied with the content and methods of their training and with their living conditions. Few had trouble adapting to American life and most found interesting jobs upon their return, some as leaders in their institutions, particularly in teaching and research. The problem of recognition of American diplomas by Tunisian universities is beginning to be solved.  Even if only half the participants are employed as planned, the introduction of trained personnel into assistance programs will benefit the country.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","664-0035-C-00-2002-00","","1/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural economics|Economics education|Management education|Higher education|Educational development|Institution building|Participants","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL945.pdf","8,575 KB","002293 - Amouri Institute of Applied Psychology|008616 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop resources and methodologies for improving host country project management.  Special evaluation covers the period 1978-82 and is based on document review and interviews with project personnel and A.I.D. Regional Bureau officers. Major project objectives were achieved.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Development Project Management Center (DPMC) has undertaken 50 short-term consultancies in 21 countries.  Drawing on these field experiences, the DPMC developed a performance approach for improving project management and applied it during a long-term consultancy in Jamaica to train officials in project management and establish a Jamaican consultant unit to support continued training. Ongoing long-term assignments in Portugal, Thailand, and the Sahel should reveal the replicability of the DPMC approach to management development.  The DPMC has issued several development publications and is actively involved in networking. A second implementing agency, the National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration, arranged for 32 consulting teams to assess LDC training programs and training institution and organizational management capacities.  Applied research on social development management and the assessment of management training was begun, and a workshop held on each topic.  Management training materials in French were developed for use in a project in Francophone Africa.  The Association also compiled a roster of 500 management professionals and began setting up professional exchange networks. Recommendations are to:  continue the project in its present flexible form; coordinate technical assistance and applied research within each institution; clarify and more slectively focus each institution's research agenda; explore regional differences in management development needs; emphasize documentation of field activities; prepare and disseminate a report on the key elements and application of the DPMC's intervention methodology; decide on the future role of the DPMC; and make applied research a more integral part of field activities.","Attached to PD-AAL-991","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Management information systems|Development project management|Management training","Jamaica","","","000188 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop a national family planning (FP) program in Ghana.  Final evaluation covers the period 9/72-3/82; methodology is unspecified. Project success has been limited due primarily to poor management within the Ghana National FP Program (GNFPP), transportation and gasoline shortages, and GNFPP lack of coordination with other Government of Ghana (GOG) agencies.  Ghana's population growth rate still stands at 3.0-3.3%, compared to 3.3% in 1972 and the project has reached only 6-8% of women in fertile age (WIFA) compared to a projected 25%.  Integrated community-based programs were established in two regions, primarily through efforts by PVO's, but the GNFPP failed to undertake planned experimental retail programs in two other regions.  Subsidized demographic studies conducted at the University of Ghana (UG) were seldom used by the GOG.  Although 300 FP public health clinics now exist (200 were projected), no retail sales outlets have operated since the end of the Retail Commercial Sales project (3/31/81).  No acceptor reports have been produced since the UG computer service broke down in 1978.  The few in-country mobile teams that exist are supported by PVO's. However, a wide array of training was undertaken, including U.S. and in-country training for various ministry staff; training of nearly 1,000 Ghanaians in specific FP skills; training of trainers programs for maternal/child health (MCH) and other nursing staff; FP training of more than 4,000 graduate nurses; and a seminar for nursing officers on integrating MCH/FP into the primary health care system. In addition, as a result of a comprehensive information, education, and communication program, an estimated 60% of WIFA know at least one FP method. The project has shown the limitations of an FP system that is created artificially by A.I.D. and placed vertically within a government system. Two follow-on projects (Contraceptive Supplies and Primary Health Care) will be implemented by the Ministry of Health.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","National level|Delivery systems|Family planning occupations|Medical education|Limited data","Ghana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM003.pdf","125 KB","008547 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop a rural credit and savings system to provide credit to small farmers and rural producers in Bangladesh. Project completion report covers the period 9/78-8/82; no methodology is stated. Project objectives were achieved.  The project tested eight lending models in combination with varying interest rates on loans and savings at 98 outlets.  The nine participating financial institutions made 72,188 loans valued at BDT 109 million and savings of BDT 10 million were achieved.  Lending for non-agricultural activities and agricultural activities other than crop production was increased. Credit was provided to target groups, resulting in increases in production and income. Project credit outlets recovered more loans and collected more penalties for overdue loans than did other credit outlets.  Three institutions used locally generated funds to finance up to one-third of their loans. Approximately 15% of outstanding project loans were covered by deposits; non-target groups provided 58% of deposits.  Productivity of the group lending model was the lowest of the models tested.  The project caused lenders in the informal credit market to reduce their rates substantially; 42% of sample borrowers perceived interest rates to be low.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","10/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural credit|RURAL AREAS|Limited data","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL998.pdf","71 KB","008511 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to manufacture 240,000 mosti-type irrigation handpumps in Bangladesh and sell them to farmers.  Project completion report covers the period 1976-1982; no methodology is stated. Pump sales, due to begin during the 1976-77 irrigation season, were delayed by a shortfall in the Government of Bangladesh's provision of pipe and lack of a financial mechanism for allocating pump materials to the private sector.  The joint project implementation committee was unable to address these problems. The project was restructured in 6/77 and the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC) was given implementation responsibility. The revised project emphasized pump fabrication rather than sales and procured the services of a consultant engineering firm.  The BADC was to be reimbursed from pump sales for local purchases of pump heads, strainers, and pipes; targeted sales were reduced from 240,000 to 200,000 pumps. Prices were fixed initially at about 60% of manufacturing cost; as farmers became more familiar with the advantages of handpump irrigation, prices were increased twice and now stand at about 70% of cost.  About 120,000 pumps have been sold to farmers. Although the revised sales target was not met, recent data indicate farmer acceptance and use of handpumps and improved domestic manufacturing capability.  In view of a planned World Bank follow-on project and the development of two new handpumps which may prove to be competitors, the project has been terminated and funds deobligated as planned.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","10/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Hand pumps|Limited data","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL997.pdf","7,985 KB","008511 - USAID.

"Evaluates two projects to improve agricultural marketing in the Guatemalan highlands by strengthening the Central Cooperativa de Mercadeo Agricola (CECOMERCA).  Special evaluation covers the period 1979-81; no methodology is given. CECOMERCA has barely withstood many obstacles to its success.  The two founding federations (FECOAR and FENACDAC) and their affiliates have never cooperated in recruiting membership to CECOMERCA; a reported 2,000 new members never actually joined.  The GTQ800,000 programmed for agricultural credit to stimulate interest in participating in CECOMERCA were never loaned to farmers.  CECOMERCA administrators, chosen for their loyalty, were not competent in Guatemalan marketing.  When the two co-adminstrators could not cooperate, one resigned.  Technical assistance (TA) was ineffective in training CECOMERCA administrative personnel in cooperative management.  Finally, A.I.D. ceased supervising the project when TA was contracted from Caribbean Technical Services, thus leaving USAID/G unaware of project impasses.  External factors contributing to project difficulties included political/economic instability in the highlands and problematic traditional markets in neighboring countries. To increase the chances for project viability, recommendations are made to use TA specialists in:  (1) enrolling dues-paying farmers from FECOAR and FENACOAC as CECOMERCA members; (2) upgrading CECOMERCA administrative capacity in national and export marketing; and (3) improving internal planning, production and commercialization, pricing policy, and accounting systems.  Participant training should be provided to administrative and technical personnel in cooperative planning and in product processing and handling, respectively. It is suggested that the interest rate on A.I.D. loans to the projects be raised from 6% to current rates used by the federations associated with CECOMERCA.  Whatever rate is used, extension by CECOMERCA of agricultural credit should be officially initiated no later than 10/82.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural cooperatives|Institution building|Agricultural product marketing|Marketing","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM055.pdf","1,758 KB","008550 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the Government of Tanzania (GOT) develop a pilot comprehensive health program in 30 primary schools.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/80-8/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with school, health, GOT, USAID/T, and AID/W personnel. Although progress is being made, objectives will not be met within the allotted time.  Implementation has been delayed by 12-20 months due to insufficient contractor authority over procurement and construction, a cholera epidemic which diverted the energies of the project field coordinator, materials unavailability, and transportation problems. The project has also suffered from the absence of the GOT program director (receiving U.S.-graduate training), and a lack of clarity regarding the roles of expatriate advisors and central and regional GOT health and education personnel. Despite these problems, a rough draft of a school health handbook has been produced; one chapter is being pretested in schools and a teacher training curriculum based on the handbook is being prepared.  A protocol for teachers to use in screening for and treating illnesses, as well as a school health course are also in draft form.  Limited project orientation training has been provided to district health officers, school health coordinators, and head teachers, but planned teacher training is threatened by the GOT's failure to program funds for transportation and per diems.  U.S. graduate training is being provided to two health officials, but no training has been programmed for education officials. Procurement of school health kit supplies and development of a student health record system have also begun.  Inputs have been provided to school farms, but it appears unlikely that the farms will be able to support planned school feeding programs; while 1-3 schools have begun school feeding, most still lack kitchen facilities and utensils.  The schools' water supply and sanitation needs have been ascertained; some digging of wells and latrines has begun.  Finally, collection of baseline data for use in future expansion of the program is underway. Support for project activities among teachers, local officials, and community members has been strong. It is recommended that the project be extended 2 years to 9/85 to allow completion of planned outputs; other recommendations concern training and project management.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","12/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Health education|Teacher training|Pilot projects","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM075.pdf","3,996 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","000186 - USAID.

"Evaluates project implemented by the South-East Consortium for International Development (SECID) to establish environmental training and institution building resource management programs in Africa. Special evaluation covers the period 10/80-6/82 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with project personnel. Implementation has been inadequate due to the narrative (as opposed to analytical) nature of the Memoranda of Understanding and Working Agreements, unstructured management by SECID, and ineffective management by A.I.D.  The environmental training component has been marked by a slow start, which resulted in a slippage in planned training activities and cost overruns of 44%, and by two structural changes - a major reduction in the number of short seminars for LDC policymakers (only two of the 17 planned through 1982 have been held) and a reduction in the duration of the medium-term courses from 4-6 to 2-3 weeks. Nonetheless, short-term courses, which have so far been attended by some 120 students, are considered potentially beneficial, while the five medium-term courses held to date (attended by 161 students) have had notable input from Africans.  Long-term training activities are lagging and targets are not likely to be met. Despite adequate inputs, the resource management component has fallen short of targets, although this is an inherent risk in institution building activities and progress is being made toward long-term goals. The district environmental profiles for Kenya are nearly complete and represent the most productive activity to date.  Work with Sudan's Institute for Environmental Studies also seems productive, and efforts to develop a village environmental health monitoring model in Tanzania should be continued despite their limited value to date.  Drought has caused work in Botswana to be postponed.  On the negative side, too much resource management work has been conducted in the United States and the work appears overly academic and detached from reality. Despite the above criticisms, the evaluators deem the project worthy of continuance provided the implementation process is restructured; recommendations to the latter end are provided.","Work order no. 12|Attached to PD-AAM-105","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/SOD/PDC-C-0251","","6/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource management|Environmental education|Institution building","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAM105A.pdf","1,490 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates project implemented by the African American Labor Center (AALC) to build free, democratic trade unions in Zaire, Liberia, and Senegal.  Special evaluation covers a period ending 3/82 and is based on site visits and meetings with local union and with USAID and U.S. Embassy officials. Success has varied.  In Zaire, the Union Nationale des Travailleurs du Zaire (UNTZa) fell short of achieving AALC goals due to its close supervision by the government, although it advanced socioeconomic well-being and mediated disputes between strikers and the government. UNTZa's AALC-supported social service programs in primary health care, labor education, and maternal/child health care were its most successful activities. AALC's close ties to the U.S. Embassy and USAID/Z risks compromising AALC's independence, but may be needed to maintain AALC's role in Zaire. In Liberia, the AALC played a significant role in the 1980 merger of two rival unions into the Liberian Federation of Trade Unions (LFLU), but its promotion of LFLU goals has been limited by deteriorating economic conditions, labor unrest, and LFLU's financial and organizational inadequacies.  Both USAID/L and the U.S. Embassy strongly support AALC, but neither are sanguine about LFLU's future and so advocate a broadening of AALC's union contacts. In Senegal, the offical trade union, the Confederation Nationale des Travailleurs du Senegal (CNTS), has shown little interest in worker education programs or independent union activity due to its close political ties.  An ll/81 agreement between AALC and CNTS provided for renewed bilateral activities but none were initiated.  Although both AALC and USAID/S supported establishment of a Regional Institute for Higher Trade Union Education, lack of a bilateral program and of a vital trade union movement limit AALC's relation to USAID/S and the U.S. Embassy. General recommendations are to:  independently evaluate AALC activities; reexamine the Liberian and Zairian programs and AID-AFL/CIO activities in LDC's; decentralize AID-funded AALC activities; reduce LFLU staff and audit its finances; and develop a closer AALC-U.S. Government working relationship on African labor affairs.  An appendix provides the AALC's critique of the evaluation.","Attached to PD-AAM-108","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Institution building","Congo DR|Liberia|Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAM108A.pdf","6,947 KB","000013 - USAID.

"Evaluates housing guaranty project to develop the capacity of Bolivia's Central Savings and Loan (S&amp;L) Housing Bank (CACEN) and its member Mutuals to finance low-income shelter solutions in rural areas. Final evaluation, prepared by a consultant, covers the period 6/79-8/82 and is based on document review, visits to 4 of 9 participating Mutuals, and interviews with Mutual officials and and project beneficiaries. Although implemented in the wake of the worst economic crisis ever to hit Bolivia and the CACEN, the project had an outstanding impact on Bolivia's rural poor and developed the capacity of CACEN and the S&amp;L system to finance low-income shelter solutions in widely diverse geographic areas for over 3,000 families not previously served by any credit institution. Technicians were trained, branch offices opened, widespread enthusiasm for ongoing project services generated, and a solid foundation for new projects laid. The S&amp;L system has learned from the problems associated with implementation of the project, such as excessive paperwork, difficulties with agrarian reform lands, and the time required for special legal work, mortgage registry, loan processing, and outreach efforts. On the negative side, administrative costs were high, due in part to increased outreach efforts and a lack of financial planning capabilities, and the amount of savings generated was low. The S&amp;L system's continued ability to finance shelter solutions depends on the retention of key technicians and the availability of funds from loan repayments or generated savings. In responding to the severe economic crisis, CACEN should gradually increase interest rates and consider a media campaign to explain measures being taken to counteract the crisis. CACEN should also require use of the environmental checklist for type B and C loans. The project taught the need to: consider linguistic and personal interaction skills in technician selection and training; follow up media campaigns with personal visits; staff branch offices with qualified personnel; provide production as well as housing credit; and incorporate a cost/design methodology in technician training.","Attached to PD-AAM-113","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","511-0510-S-00-2014-00","","8/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Housing investment guaranty|Housing credit|Low cost housing|Financial institutions|Credit|Institution building|Savings and loan associations|Rural areas|Finance|Beneficiary interviews","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAM113A.pdf","3,097 KB","008515 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the Department of Agricultural Education and Extension (DAEE) at the University of Dar es Salaam at Morogoro, Tanzania train personnel to plan and implement village-level agricultural development.  Special evaluation covers the period 6/79-11/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project, USAID/T, Government of Tanzania (GOT), and DAEE personnel. Despite many unforeseen problems, the project is on course.  Linkages have been established between DAEE and other bilateral projects, the Ministry of Agriculture, extension services, agricultural research stations, and villages; extension, however, is the weakest link in this network.  U.S. training (Ph.D., M.S., and short-term) is being provided to 15 faculty.  DAEE has offered undergraduates 180 course hours of extension-oriented training, exceeding targets; provided 6 of 10 planned short courses; and will present 2 of 3 planned specialized workshops and initiate an M.S. program in 1983. However, only 3 of a planned 25 agricultural education/extension students were graduated in 1982 and the curriculum still does not provide sufficient field work. Construction of a planned Center for Continuing Education in Agriculture (CCEA) is virtually complete following long delays; but the facility will not be useable until the GOT installs windows and repairs roofs.  Establishment of the planned Audiovisual Center to support DAEE and CCEA training and extension services was delayed by both construction and procurement problems; it appears that the Center's planned program is too ambitious. However, DAEE and CCEA will not become self-sufficient Tanzanian-staffed programs by the planned project completion date. While the project has suffered from construction and procurement delays and unforeseeable contractor health problems, the overriding constraint has been the GOT's failure to provide local staff.  This was due partly to a decision to provide Ph.D. (rather than merely M.S.) training to 3 faculty members, a decision which left the contractor without counterparts for long periods of time and will interrupt post-project continuity; e.g., the participant slated to be head of the CCEA will not complete training until mid-1985. Six recommendations are made to address these problems and to extend the project 3 months to permit completion of the academic year.","Attached to PD-AAM-115","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural extension training|Universities and colleges|Project change","Tanzania","","","008612 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the Government of The Gambia (GOTG) establish a forestry management program.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/79-1/82 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with knowledgable individuals. Although implementation of most project components is 14-20 months behind schedule, good progress has been made in the project's most important component, training of Forestry Department staff.  One sawyer has been trained and two others are being trained; five technicians are working toward two-year diplomas abroad; and a professional forester is receiving B.S. training in Tanzania.  Another professional will receive his M.S. in forest mensuration, and an extension specialist will begin technical training in 6/82. By contrast, plantation site clearing is behind schedule, with only 585 of a scheduled 675 ha cleared and almost the entire area needing replanting.  Efforts to reproduce the Gmelina species have not yet yielded results, the first year's planting being lost to drought and the second year's to fire; fire suppression capability at the plantations is inadequate.  Woodlots are being established at a rate of two per year and existing woodlots expanded by 1 ha annually, but excessive losses occurred during the last planting season due to external causes.  A study on the feasibility of harvesting and marketing mangroves was completed in l981, but no follow-up action has been taken by GOTG. Installation and operation of new sawmill equipment was delayed by procurement difficulties and has now incurred extensive cost-overruns. Finally, the project's woodstove component has received a favorable evaluation. Forestry Department staff are fully extended and lack the capacity to expand present operations; this situation will be alleviated when the professional and technical trainees (cf. above) return.  A total of l7 recommendations adress needs to reorient training, establish links to related projects in The Gambia, modify the plantation establishment schedule, purchase sawmill equipment, develop a fire suppresion capability, and conduct forestry studies.","Evaluation period: Aug 1979-Jan 1982","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Forests|Plantations|Forestry|Agricultural training|Reforestation","Gambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM117.pdf","10,171 KB","008545 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to provide energy management training to LDC government officials.  Special evaluation covers the period 1978-8/82 and is based on document review, surveys of participants, and interviews with participants, their supervisors, and AID/W and contractor personnel. Although the project has provided short-term U.S. training to 195 energy planning officials from 57 countries (not all of which are LDC's), its usefulness has been limited by its failure to continue to attract high-level officials.  The training was not as intense as it might have been and emphasized sectoral and technological materials at the expense of case studies dealing directly with energy planning, pricing, and project evaluation. A number of LDC's have outgrown the course, which is viewed as an introductory overview of energy policy analysis.  Those continuing to participate tend to send junior civil servants and others not directly involved in energy planning. Monographs produced by guest lecturers and a 1/82 seminar in the Philippines were of fair to good quality. The project was also hampered by inadequate management, particularly by failures to document the evolving course curriculum, formally follow-up on participant activities, involve Missions in participant selection, or set English proficiency standards for participants.  There were also continual problems with course logistics and participants' housing and working conditions. Past participants, most of whom still work in the same or a closely related job, generally felt that the training was personally and professionally beneficial.  However, only early, higher-level graduates had any influence on key energy decisions, and their influence was only moderate. Contractor attempts to establish a newsletter to foster post-course participant networking failed and, in fact, little networking has occurred even within countries. It is recommended that the project be terminated as currently constituted and regional energy management training, incorporating extensive interaction with LDC energy ministries, be considered.  A detailed approach to regional training is outlined. Recommendations are also made addressing shortcomings in the present program.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/SOD/PDC-C-0307","","9/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Energy|Management training|Energy policy|Energy planning|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM146.pdf","7,014 KB","000840 - International Energy Associates, Ltd.","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Evaluation team|Pre evaluation data","","","","24 Sep 1982","","IEAL-262","","Evaluation of the energy management training program","","PD-AAM-146","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTY3MTA1","Technical Assistance","9311160"
"Evaluates project to design and promote rural enterprises in Eastern Upper Volta.  Special evaluation covers the period 1977-1981 and is based on document review, interviews with and a survey of selected beneficiaries, and interviews with personnel from USAID/UV and Partnership for Productivity (PfP), the PVO implementing the project. Due to lack of development in Eastern Upper Volta, the project focus shifted from promoting self-sustaining enterprises to providing credit for small-scale economic activities. Disbursement of 416 loans (40 were projected) totalling $275,000 to 313 clients has helped meet a large demand for commercial credit, but was marred by credit fund decapitalization, high administrative costs, and inadequate collection of baseline data. The loans have had few tangible effects on local communities. The loan repayment rate was less favorable than reported (77% rather than 90%), and provision of management training to loan clients was generally unsuccessful.  A legal complication is likely since PfP lacks authority to make interest-bearing loans in Upper Volta. Activities at the two project sites were independently managed; Fada n'Gourma operations were largely unmonitored and undocumented, and management at Diapaga, while better, was still inadequate. Although PfP has begun to address some of these deficiencies, income-generating and indigenization activities planned for Phase II seem extremely risky.  It is recommended that A.I.D. analyze the feasibility of planned income-generating activities and consider establishing a small enterprise development fund at a Voltaic institution, which in the long run may be more effective than a fund initiated by an expatriate organization.  A.I.D. should also maintain stricter monitoring and evaluation standards for credit projects. PfP should:  (1) increase supervision of field staff; (2) adjust policies regarding delinquent loans, loan criteria, and client equity contributions; (3) continue to collect balance sheet data on clients; (4) test the impact of certain management practices on selected clients; (5) assess administrative costs; (6) analyze the loan fund's portfolio quality; and (7) manage potentially profitable activities separately from the loan fund.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Small scale enterprises|Credit|Rural areas|Technical assistance|Partnerships|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Burkina Faso","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM172.pdf","5,202 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates project to establish a pilot rural health care delivery system in Sine Saloum, Senegal.  Special evaluation, prepared under project 9365900, covers the period 3/80-7/82 and is based on a survey of project personnel, beneficiaries, and Senegalese administrators at 60 of the project's 378 health huts. Survey results show that targets were met or exceeded in 9 of 21 areas selected by the evaluation team.  These were:  health and management committees trained; village health workers (VHW's) cross-trained and working; sanitation programs introduced; village meetings held regularly; beneficiaries aware of health hut services; nurses and environmental health technicians (EHT's) trained as trainers; monthly activity reports completed; regular supervision and ongoing training provided to VHW's and village committees; and motorbikes for nurses and EHT's maintained and operating. The other areas were evaluated only partially.  Targets not met included the requirements that 75% of health personnel develop quarterly workplans and that EHT's attend monthly departmental meetings.  Some project areas were not evaluated at all, e.g., financial viability of health huts, maintenance of health hut logs, and training of VHW's as trainers. Recommendations are to:  (1) develop new tools to measure the impact of village primary health care programs on local decisionmaking; and (2) integrate the project with other Government of Senegal development programs in the region or expand the project's scope to include agriculture, literacy, women's development, and cottage industries. Recommendations regarding evaluation procedures are to continue to use interministerial evaluation teams, but collect and tabulate data before calling the team in; minimize errors by selecting workers experienced in data collection; translate all survey questions into the vernacular and pretest them;, and involve consultants in the evaluation process from the beginning. A list of all the areas selected for evaluation by the team and a translation of the detailed preliminary evaluation report are annexed.","Evaluation period: 2 May 1982-31 Jul 1982","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","1/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Health delivery|Rural areas|Medical education|Technical assistance|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM174.pdf","2,243 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","000074 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help Opportunities Industrialization Centers International (OICI) develop and support country OIC's and their vocational training programs.  Special evaluation covers the period through 8/82 and is based on document review, site visits, surveys of and interviews with OIC graduates and their employers, and discussions with OICI, OIC, Mission, and LDC officials. The project has been hobbled by poor OICI-AID relations and severe staff cutbacks due to extreme funding delays. OICI has completed only 5 of 16 planned feasibility studies and only 4 of 11 planned proposals.  A procedures manual will not be completed as planned, and only 10 of 16 planned new interest groups designed to initiate new OIC's have been incorporated or registered.  The cutbacks have also had a deleterious effect on OICI project monitoring, field support to OIC's, and planning. OICI - which receives 99% of its funding from A.I.D. - has not yet begun to seek other funding sources. The OIC's have also suffered greatly from funding delays. Nonetheless, the 6 of 11 planned operating OIC's along with 2 graduated (self-sustaining) OIC's (all in Africa) have trained 5,682 people, mostly dropouts; 4,097 youths received vocational/technical training, 975 received entrepreneurial management training, and 133 received agricultural training. OIC's also trained 232 redundant civil servants and 245 adult farmers.  All OIC's have long waiting lists.  LDC officials, employers of the graduates, and past trainees are extremely enthusiastic about OIC programs, except that LDC officials give mixed reviews to agricultural training at OIC facilities. However, OICI has failed to plan for the operations of the six OIC's when A.I.D. funds are withdrawn. It is recommended that OICI:  restructure its organization; focus on building and supporting OIC's rather than on training; discontinue costly boarding of agricultural trainees; develop a plan to assist graduated OIC's; revise its management information system to accommodate field needs and staff shortages; and give immediate priority to fundraising.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Farmer training|Vocational training|Institution building|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM177.pdf","34,838 KB","001172 - Barnett and Engel|000451 - Druben and Ricci Associates, Inc.","","000912 - Opportunities Industrialization Centers International, Inc.","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation|Multi country evaluation|Evaluation team","","Barnett, Stanley A.|Druben, Stan|et al.","","30 Sep 1982","","","","Assessment of institutional capability of OIC International, Inc.","","PD-AAM-177","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTY3MTUw","Private and Development Cooperation","9380184"
"Evaluates two projects to strengthen the institutional capability of the World Scout Bureau Community Development Project (WSB/CD). Special evaluation covers the period 1977-1981 and is based on visits to WSB headquarters in Geneva and to 7 target countries. Helped by the A.I.D. grants, the WSB/CD staff has grown in size and competence, conducted national and regional leadership training seminars/workshops throughout the developing world, prepared a large number of CD manuals which have been translated into at least four languages, and identified and inspired 20 target country Scout associations (SA's).  Not being specialists, the staff have been less successful in assisting CD projects technically. The national SA's, which for the most part accept CD as the primary Scouting activity, are producing CD plans adapted to local conditions with the support of their governments and have been wonderfully sucessful in promoting CD, broadly defined to include development training, youth education, community and employment assistance, and rural development.  Scout programs have been especially helpful in serving the short- and long-term needs of unemployed youth, particularly in rural areas.  Although USAID's are slightly skeptical whether the national SA's can produce enduring CD results, the evaluators judge that in this project A.I.D. has accidentally hit upon a frugal and extremely effective means of development training. In future WSB/CD activities, it is recommended that WSB/CD visit the neediest SA's to provide inspiration and put them in contact with local financial and technical resources; develop international funding sources for CD; improve communication with target countries through a newsletter; and translate the most popular training manuals into local languages, with broader circulation.  For future A.I.D. support, it is recommended that a specific amount of funds be subgranted to SA's, with defined procedures for doing this; occupational training and the preparation of youth for development be made the purpose of the project; and A.I.D.'s support of WSB/CD be clearly defined and alternative funding sources developed.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Community development|Institution building|Private voluntary organizations|Youth|Vocational training","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM179.pdf","4,150 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Evaluation team|Onsite evaluation","","Kilbridge, Maurice|Smail, Robert W.","","Feb 1982","","","","Evaluation report : USAID development program grant and institutional support grant to the US Foundation for International Scouting to strengthen community development capability","","PD-AAM-179","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTY3MTUz","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","9380148|9320083"
"Evaluates project implemented by Lutheran World Relief (LWR) to provide drought relief assistance in Niger.  Special evaluation, which focuses on 8 of 13 subprojects, covers the period l979-81 and is based on site visits, document review, and conversations with project beneficiaries and personnel. While results have been mixed, progress has been made in meeting the basic needs of farmers and herders for food and drinking water.  The cost-effectiveness of the eight subprojects is high; in the last 3 years, $580,000 was expended to build 325 wells, 170 ha of irrigated gardens, plus secondary outputs (e.g., road construction, live fencing, and educational and health delivery systems directly benefitting l3,000 people. The four successful subprojects (Telemces, Tanguechmane, Filingue Wells, and Tahoua Gardens) have:  rapidly increased the number of gardeners employed and garden surfaces planted over a 5-year period; successfully integrated women into gardening activities; encouraged local participation in well construction; stabilized settlements through more effective use of available land and water; and increased the variety and availability of vegetables. The less successful subprojects (Damana Gardens, Gaya, Tahoua Fruit Tree Nursery, Tillabery Mares) have been negatively affected by:  lack of follow-through, untimely delivery of seeds and cuttings, inadequate fencing, bad site and participant selection, Forest Service inability to reach agreement with the local population on methods of tree protection and maintenance, collapsed dams, and the lack of coordinated management and supervision. Lessons learned include the need for a framework to encourage participatory self-help input and for regional general use plans. General recommendations are to:  tighten financial control and project administration; assist subprojects until they are self-sustaining; emphasize subprojects providing more food and water; select six major clusters on which to focus resources and phase others out; avoid helping one group at the expense of another; allow staff members to spend more time in the field; and develop an effective live fence maintenance and exploitation formula.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Drought|Disaster relief|Water supply|Food production|Private voluntary organizations","Niger","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM181.pdf","3,505 KB","001252 - Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Evaluation team|Onsite evaluation","","Hoskins, Marilyn W.|Weber, Fred R.","","Feb 1982","","","","Evaluation of Lutheran World Relief projects : Niger","","PD-AAM-181","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTY3MTU2","Niger","9320132"
"Evaluates project to strengthen the capability of the Caribbean Community Secretariat (CARICOM) to meet health manpower needs in the region.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/80-7/81 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with project, health agency, and volunteer health personnel. The project suffered from an 8-month delay in signing the agreement between CARICOM and the other implementing agency - the National Council for International Health (NCIH) - and from an A.I.D. proposal (never effected) to redirect project efforts. Nonetheless, valuable health manpower assistance has been provided to participating countries.  Of 22 requests for short-term health volunteers (physicians and other health professionals), 9 were filled through NCIH recruitment of U.S. volunteers and 4 through CARICOM recruitment of Caribbean volunteers; 3 requests were filled by other agencies and 3 are pending. Requests were generally filled promptly and the volunteers had a notable impact on the performance of indigenous health providers, nurses in particular.  While participating countries have been very satisfied with the volunteers, they question the preponderance of U.S. volunteers and recognize that short-term volunteerism is but a stopgap measure. Only modest progress was made in health manpower planning.  A health manpower coordinator, added to CARICOM's staff in 5/81, has helped countries document requests for volunteers and has coordinated placement efforts, promoted manpower sharing among countries, and effected liaisons with other health agencies and projects.  He has also begun to collect data for a regional health manpower inventory. A second CARICOM staff member has provided training to health managers. There is still an urgent need to strengthen facilities for analyzing regional health needs and coordinating the efforts of the many independent agencies working in manpower planning. It is therefore recommended that the project be extended 18 months to allow further development of CARICOM's leadership role.  Activities should focus on increasing CARICOM's responsibility for placing volunteers, conducting a regional inventory of health manpower and health facilities in the Caribbean, and developing a national/regional data base and an expanded program for regional organization of health manpower.","Attached to PD-AAM-186","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Development organizations|Volunteers|Labor research|Health occupations|Health care planning|Health policy","Eastern Caribbean","","","","","","English","","Indepth evaluation|Multi country evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","Rosenfeld, Leonard S.","","12 Aug 1982","","","","National Council for International Health/Caribbean Community Secretariat; health manpower project : an evaluation","","XD-AAM-186-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTY3MTY5","Caribbean Regional","5380054"
"Evaluates project to improve primary education in 45 pilot schools in the Caribbean and to expand the capability of the University of the West Indies (UWI) to assist Caribbean educational systems. Special evaluation covers the period 7/81-6/82 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with personnel from national Ministries of Education, Missions, UWI, and pilot schools. Good progress has been made. Curricula outlines, teachers' manuals, and teaching aids have been developed through Level III (ages 9-10). The Level III math, science, and social science curricula are excellent, but language arts materials need further work. Teacher interest in the project has increased as has the effectiveness of teaching in the pilot schools. However, despite provision of teacher training as scheduled and increased school visits by project staff, more teacher training is needed than was planned. Training of administrators and principals has increased in frequency and quality. Diagnostic and achievement tests have been developed in math, science, and social studies Levels I-III, but baseline data on student achievement are still lacking. The entire process of documentation and internal evaluation is behind schedule and needs to be simplified. This problem is especially critical due to the untimely death of the Project Evaluation Specialist. Further work is also needed on regional educational planning and on revising the exams for students over age 11 to relect project curricula. UWI's Research and Development and Inservice Education departments have increased their services to participating countries, but better cooperation among these entities and UWI's School of Education - the main implementor - is still needed. Significant progress has been made in developing individual countries' capabilities to develop curricula and in disseminating project curricula. Several countries have developed reading materials specifically for their children and project curricula have already been used in nonproject schools and teachers' colleges. However, a formal plan for wider dissemination is needed. It is recommended that the project be extended so it can disseminate the curricula to all schools in the countries involved. Other recommendations address the needs noted above.","Attached to PD-AAM-187","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Primary education|Education|Pilot projects|Curriculum design|Teacher training","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAM187A.pdf","2,465 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Multi country evaluation|Evaluation team|Onsite evaluation|Indepth evaluation","","Massanari, Karl|Whitmore, Joanne R.|Wynn, Cordell","Basic education","23 Jun 1982","","","","Evaluation report of the UWI/USAID primary education project","","XD-AAM-187-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTY3MTcx","Caribbean Regional","5380029"
"Evaluates pilot project to provide sanitation education and waste disposal pits and latrines in rural Botswana.  Final evaluation covers the period 9/80-12/82 and is based on beneficiaries' responses to questionnaires and interviews with village leaders and project participants. Despite initial delays in personnel recruitment and organization, the project has made good progress.  As the result of the first year's educational campaign use of refuse pits increased from 62% to 78% of households in the six pilot villages; 95% of the inhabitants were aware of the health implications of appropriate refuse disposal; 25% burned all refuse; and 59% burned it irregularly.  The relationship between germs and disease was understood by 26% of pilot villagers versus 12% of control villagers. The project's second phase, construction of household latrines, was highly successful.  One-third (245) of pilot village households have built latrines (although only 20% have been completed), representing a 36% increase.  Four pit models were developed according to soil conditions; materials for sub- and superstructures were of local origin when possible. For durability, 69% of beneficiaries preferred bricks over mud while 75% preferred corrugated iron roofs over thatch. Latrines were sufficiently inexpensive as evidenced by the fact that 69% which were constructed by the poorest households.  In both pilot and control villages, 97% of the people realized a connection between latrine use and health. Some implementation difficulties were experienced due to poor training and coordination of village extensionists; poor communication between project personnel and villagers concerning latrine design, materials, and costs; and the substitution and delayed availability of materials. Villagers were largely unaware that latrine construction costs were subsidized.  The reason for a high rate of non-use of latrines by children under age 9 was not fully understood. Recommendations addressing these problems are made in order to successfully complete project activities in the pilot villages and extend post-project activities into other villages.","Attached to PD-AAM-202","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID 80-20","","12/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Sanitation education|Outdoor toilet facilities|Rural areas|Sanitation|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Botswana","","","","","","English","","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","Pradal, Pia","Water supply and sanitation","Dec 1982","","","","Environmental sanitation and protection project; final evaluation, social impact analysis","","XD-AAM-202-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTY3Mjky","Botswana","6330084"
"Evaluates project to assist AID-funded forestry and forestry-related activities and promote increased AID/Peace Corps (PC) collaboration in village forestry and natural resource conservation activities.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/80-7/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with A.I.D., PC, U.S. Forest Service (FS), and State Department personnel. The project is fulfilling its objectives.  The FS-implemented Forestry Support Program (FSP) has satisfied Regional Bureaus' and Missions' previously unmet needs for technical assistance, primarily by arranging consultancies by outside experts; due to staff shortages the FS itself has completed only four short-term consultancies.  The FSP has assisted 17 ongoing and planned projects in Latin America and the Caribbean and numerous projects in Africa. Assistance in Asia has been limited by staff shortages and strained relationships, but the potential for increased support is good.  The FSP has also developed a computerized roster of forestry experts and is developing profiles of forestry organizations and schools; producing, collecting, and disseminating forestry publications; and documenting information sources. Staff have attended conferences and workshops in several countries. PC accomplishments, while only preliminary to actual collaborative projects, have also been impressive.  PC staff have assessed forestry programs in 25 countries; conducted 3 regional programming workshops for PC, A.I.D., and LDC personnel; and initiated several pilot projects.  In addition, pre-service technical forestry training has been provided to 48 PC volunteers and in-service training to 64 PC staff, volunteers, and LDC counterparts.  Relationships between PC and Mission personnel have generally been good, but A.I.D. failed to consult the PC during early project planning stages.  A.I.D. funding delays have frustrated PC volunteers. Key recommendations are to:  continue the project; use the FSP to support commercial forestry efforts initiated through the Bureau for Private Enterprise, the Caribbean Basin Initiative, and other programs; increase PC funding by 25%; and use P.L. 480 funds to support cooperative PC/PVO village forestry projects.","Attached to PD-AAM-204|References: p.90","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource management","","","","002523 - Society of American Foresters","","000185 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to support the activities of the International Center for Living Aquatic Resources Management (ICLARM).  Special evaluation covers the period 8/79-3/82 and is based on document review, a site visit, and discussions with ICLARM staff and the AID/W project manager. ICLARM has been exceptionally successful in developing multidisciplinary approaches to the major living aquatic resource management problems facing LDC's and has thereby established itself as an institution of considerable scientific stature. Administrative and technical management within ICLARM has been highly efficient and fiscally sound.  ICLARM has issued 13 major publications and published 15 papers in scientific journals; requests for reprints are numerous. A quarterly ICLARM newsletter is distributed to about 2,300 persons. ICLARM has participated in relevant conferences and workshops; hosted visiting students, researchers, development workers, and consultants; and advised developing country researchers and administrators.  Several ICLARM activities have had a significant impact, including a study of traditional Filipino fishermen which places the problem of poverty within the broader context of rural development, an integrated farming research project being conducted at Central Luzon State Univeristy in the Phillipines, and Asian Development Bank-ICLARM workshops on alternative energy resources in fisheries and aquaculture and on the management of tropical multispecies stocks.  In addition, ICLARM's research results and advice have been extremely useful in specific A.I.D. projects such as a rainfed resource development program (fisheries component) and a project to increase milkfish production. It is recommended that A.I.D. provide ICLARM with $700,000 per year for FY82 and FY83 and at least $350,000 per year for a 10-year period after that; that ICLARM alter its programs, organization, and personnel structure to more strongly emphasize capture fisheries; and that ICLARM intensify its extension and research efforts in tropical regions outside of Southeast Asia.","Attached to PD-AAM-231","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Fisheries|Agricultural extension|Fishery management|Fish|Agricultural research|Technical assistance|Project change","Southeast Asia","","","","","000180 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve winter wheat for LDC's by hybridizing spring and winter wheat.  Special evaluation, attached to a PES (PD-AAL-460), covers the period 7/80-4/82 and is based on document review; interviews with project personnel, U.S. and foreign small farmers, and LDC wheat program personnel; and onsite visits. The project is well on target.  Although increased wheat production is not expected to occur for 1-2 more years, other measurable goals have been achieved.  According to the evaluation team's wheat development specialists, Oregon State University (OSU), in cooperation with the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), has developed an excellent system to identify and make efficient use of the world's superior wheat germ plasm.  Nursery sites have been identified and rapid breeding achieved.  Oregon is ideal for this research, as environmental conditions parallel those of wheat- producing LDC's.  The data system developed by OSU provides rapid summary, analysis, and distribution of data to LDC cooperators worldwide. Breeders and agronomists trained at OSU now hold research and administrative positions in their own countries - 15 students have completed Ph.D. or M.S. degrees and 13 more are currently studying. (The project thus directly assists LDC's, few of which are currently able to maintain effective wheat improvement programs on their own.) The mix of students is good, with 1/3 from the United States and the rest from poor and middle-income countries.  OSU linkages with wheat improvement centers in developed countries are crucial to project success, as they provide both reliable research data to OSU and an important forum for interchanging germ plasms. Major recommendations are that the project be extended for 5 (not just 3) years to insure its continuity and success, and that A.I.D. continue to finance the project.  (The only funding alternative from from the international community, the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research, would not pick up the project as it is). The healthy cooperation between OSU and CIMMYT in this project shows the significant role U.S. institutions can play in international research; A.I.D. should explore additional cooperative projects.","Attached to PD-AAL-460","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Winter wheat|Spring wheat|Hybridization|Seeds|Research collaboration|Technical assistance|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews|Project change","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAL460A.pdf","1,133 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Onsite evaluation|Indepth evaluation|Evaluation team|Field test","","Johnson, Virgil|Morrow, Robert","","1982","","","","Spring X winter wheat : team evaluation report","","XD-AAL-460-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTY3Mzg2","Technical Assistance","9310621"
"Evaluates project to develop a producer-oriented cooperative structure capable of providing inputs and marketing services to the rural sector in Swaziland.  Final contractor report covers the period 1976-82. Project status remains the same as in 11/79, when USAID/S placed a freeze on inputs due to lack of Government of Swaziland action regarding the structure, aims, and financing of the Central Cooperative Union (CCU), the project's key output.  The project's contributions to the CCU included development of financial procedures and systems, U.S. degree training of four participants and training of others in Kenya and on-the-job, some physical infrastructure, vehicles, a communications network, and budgetary support. As a result of the project, the number of primary cooperative societies in Swaziland increased from 43 in 1974 to 135 in 1981; marketing of tomatoes, maize, and cotton increased; and annual farm supply sales grew by 234% from 1976/77-1979/80. The project was not as successful as it could have been.  Failure to formulate clear policies and operational guidelines within the CCU together with inadequate credit and working capital inhibited full attainment of the project purpose.  Definitive and specific implementation plans would have permitted more careful monitoring of project progress and host government compliance with project requirements.  The rural population should have received more orientation and information on the role of Swaziland's cooperative structure.  Provision of an advisor to the Office of Commissioner of Cooperatives could have averted the communication problems which occurred during the project. It is recommended that no further evaluations of the project be conducted and that the credit and marketing project under study by the African Development Bank be closely monitored to determine whether A.I.D. should contribute to this project and to ascertain its potential impact on other AID-supported activities.","Evaluation period: Oct 1981-Oct 1982","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural cooperatives|Marketing|Institution building|Limited data","Swaziland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM249.pdf","89 KB","008609 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to enhance the capacity of local governments in Egypt to promote village infrastructure projects. Special evaluation covers the period 3/81-3/82 and is based on visits to the six new project governorates (Baheira, Giza, Minufiya, Minya, Qaliubiya, and Qena), including village-level case studies and interviews with governorate and district officials. The project is on track.  Most district and village officials are actively involved in planning and implementing road and water projects, and local participation in and satisfaction with the projects is high. The governorates with the highest project completion rate - Baheira and Minya - are also the most decentralized; conversely, the governorate with the lowest completion rate - Qena - is the most centralized.  Some of the projects require a level of sophistication unavailable at the village or even district level, and the new types of projects eligible for FY 1982, funding, e.g., slaughterhouses and latrines, appear more amenable to local implementation; their inclusion could enhance both decentralization and the project completion rate. The key implementation problems are occurring at the higher levels. The greatest problem - predicted by a consultant in 1979 - has been the late or non-delivery of pre-paid Segwart pipe, which is delaying some 100 potable water and drainage projects. Also disturbing are the price increases on the pipe and Segwart's requirement that local units provide their own transportation on very short notice. Another major problem is the failure of ORDEV (the Organization for Reconstruction and Development of Egyptian Villages) to provide project information to district and governorate officials in a timely manner.  Close coordination between ORDEV and Chemonics, the contractor, in monitoring the projects is urged, as is overall leadership and coordination at Chemonics.  Also urged is an increase in sewage disposal projects. Other problems include the high fees charged by the Power Authority for electrical hook-ups to pumping systems; political problems resulting from the exclusion of cities and towns from the project; and the lack of adequate training and technical assistance programs.  A total of 23 recommendations are provided.","Bibcode changed from 32 to 22, 2008-05-19","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Decentralization|Community development|Water supply|Roads","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM262.pdf","1,640 KB","008539 - USAID.

"On January 1, 1980 a major earthquake rocked the Azores archipelago. This report details relief and reconstruction efforts undertaken following the disaster and the lessons taught by the experience. Background information on the Azores at the time of earthquake and on the latter's economic and social consequences are sketched and Portuguese and U.S. government and private relief operations are detailed.  The reconstruction program, which focused quickly on housing, is reviewed and assessed with regard to temporary housing solutions, the incentives provided the private sector for permanent rebuilding, and public housing projects.  Target areas for future reconstruction work are enumerated. Lessons taught by the experience include the advisability of decentralizing responsibility, of pooling national and foreign assistance funds, of distributing building materials rapidly, and of employing armed forces work brigades, private initiatives, and subsidized credit; the essentiality of local involvement; the need to pursue comprehensive disaster preparedness planning at the regional and local levels and to limit requests for international assistance to specific priority needs; the preferability of permanent to temporary housing solutions; and the possibility of providing adequate public housing for under $30,000/unit. Supporting documentation and financial details are appended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Disaster relief|Earthquakes|Housing|International cooperation","Azores","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAM214.pdf","10,801 KB","008594 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help Government of Jamaica institutions develop a capacity to increase fish production and establish a system of viable freshwater fish farms.  Special evaluation covers the period 6/79-5/82 and is based on site visits and interviews with Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) officials and other project personnel and with fish farmers. Although the project is a year behind schedule due to delays in start-up and staffing and time lost in unsuccessful negotiations to acquire a fingerling production site, significant progress has been. An Inland Fishery Unit (IFU) has been established in the MOA; 450 tilapia farms are operating with over 200 acres of ponds in production (18% of target), with construction of 200 more acres to begin as soon as technical staff and construction teams are available; and 1.2 million fingerlings and 230,000 lbs. of fish are being produced annually (9% and 4% of target, respectively.) Nonetheless, the IFU is only 63% staffed and only 56% of extensionists have been trained.  Extensionist training was curtailed by the closing of the Jamaican School of Agriculture and the lack of qualified professors at the University of the West Indies; some personnel who were trained left the project for more attractive private sector positions.  Due to the shortfall in extensionists, only 450 of 920 planned farmers have been trained.  Extension activities were further hampered by a delay in delivering vehicles and trail bikes. Achievement of project goals is unlikely unless drastic measures are taken to recruit and retain extensionists. IFU's tilapia research projects have been well designed and conducted, but analysis of results has been slow.  The IFU production system will be unable to supply the number of fingerlings needed by the increasing number of small-scale fish farmers; alternative fingerling sources are being considered.  The profitability of fish farming has proven to be as high or higher than expected. General recommendations are made to redress the constraints noted above, particularly as regards extension activities; 15 more specific recommendations are also made.  It is further recommended to extend the project 1 year and to develop a new project to continue extension services and farmer training for 3-5 years and maintain a modest research capability to solve production problems and test new culture methods.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-02-1143-00","","5/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Fish pond construction|Inland fisheries|Fisheries|Agricultural extension|Fish|Agricultural research|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM280.pdf","517 KB","001037 - Resources Development Associates International, Inc.","","001373 - USAID.

"The Entente Fund's African Enterprises Project is designed to develop a modern entrepreneurial business class in the five member nations of Benin, Ivory Coast, Niger, Togo, and Upper Volta. Reported here are the findings of the first impact evaluation since A.I.D. began funding the project in 1973. A.I.D.'s objectives are to provide, through the Fund, monies and technical assistance to six development banks in order to assist African-owned companies and to encourage development and commercial bank lending to these companies.  However, although 572 subloans have been made to date to develop a variety of economic sectors, these objectives have not been achieved. Subloans have been too few (many to large firms) to significantly affect national economies; four of the six banks show excessive subloan delinquency rates; and failure to implement the technical assistance plan has limited the positive achievements of borrowers.  Further, the development banks as a whole, as well as the promotion centers and national guaranty funds, have not been effective in assisting small businesses.  The banks' ability to extend small credits has not improved and they provide subborrowers little or no technical assistance.  Reasons for the program's failure are inadequate management and insufficient resources on the part of the involved institutions, the volatile economic and financial climate in which the program has had to operate, the lack by the Entente Fund - a nonfinancial institution - of the approach and discipline needed to manage a high-risk credit program, frequent changeovers in U.S. advisors, and inadequate A.I.D. supervision. The project has taught that:  (1) subloan criteria should be well-defined, with emphasis on higher quality subloans yielding real economic returns, including increased employment; (2) implementing institutions should be carefully assessed and A.I.D staff need credit expertise to monitor them; (3) borrowers should make reasonable financial contributions; (4) implementing institutions and borrowers need meaningful technical assistance; and (5) changes in the financial and economic climate markedly affect the success of a small business loan program. Specific issues are discussed further in nine appendices.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Banks|Financial institutions|Credit|Financial management|Technical assistance|Loans|Small scale enterprises|Private enterprises","French speaking Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL002.pdf","5,474 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Food aid programs operate today within the contexts of priority for the relatively poorest countries, a multiplicity of food donors, tighter food markets, restrictive host country financial regimes, and an increasing focus on food aid's developmental potential.  This report surveys existing literature on the nearly 30-year-old P.L. 480 program to assess the direct and developmental impacts of program food aid (Titles I and III) on recipient countries. An analysis of the direct impact of Title I programs discusses why food aid may be an inferior form of resource transfer, investigates the food import problems of low-income countries and the relation between food aid and food security, and evaluates the use of food aid as balance of payments support.  The developmental impact of food aid is discussed next, with special attention given to its incentive and disincentive effects; the role of changing tastes; the impact of food aid on government policies, nutrition, income distribution, and production technology; and the results of targeting poorer groups.  A discussion of programming and operational issues covers the increasing importance of donor effectiveness, the relation of food aid to other development assistance programs, and conditionality requirements for host country self-help measures.  A brief summary of the highly diverse impacts of food aid on development concludes the report.  Appendices include a review of food aid in India and a six-page list of references (1936-81).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title I|Development strategies","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL003.pdf","2,816 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates the impact of a project to establish a Liberian Institute of Public Administration (LIPA) to assume a leading role in the Government of Liberia's (GOL's) efforts to reform its Civil Service Agency (CSA). Special evaluation covers the period 1972-78 and is based on document review and interviews with USAID/L and GOL personnel and project beneficiaries. Twenty-eight LIPA professionals (9 of them women) received M.S. training abroad and a wide range of middle management course materials were developed for their use in subsequently training some 600 civil servants.  While most trainees felt that they had benefited from the experience, the project's overall impact on Liberian public service performance was minimal, due mainly to poor leadership at LIPA, the GOL's failure to provide top-level support or formulate a public sector training policy, and A.I.D.'s premature termination of the project in 1978.  Moreover, LIPA suffered from lack of credibility among its target group and from an incompetent administrative and logistic staff. Those who attended LIPA programs were not always key mid-level managers, as planned; the training provided at LIPA was not pertinent to CSA realities; and LIPA's other planned roles, such as research and consulting, never came to fruition. The project was not a complete failure.  The establishment of LIPA by a government steeped in patronage and nepotism was itself a signficant achievement, as were LIPA's ability to become operational after only 3 years of technical assistance and its continued existence 10 years later. Lessons learned are:  (1) the project was too ambitious, allotted insufficient time for institution building, and wrongly presupposed a reformed CSA and the evolution of a GOL policy regarding public sector training; (2) some problems could have been avoided had the target group - mid-level civil servants - been consulted; (3) little can be accomplished without top-level political support; (4) conflicts between the directors of CSA and LIPA undermined CSA reform; (5) Liberia was not not ready for host-country contracting in 1972 (and still is not); and (6) poor-to-average USAID/L monitoring and contractor performance indicate an A.I.D. quality control problem.","Attached to PD-AAL-663","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Government reform|Public administration|Organizations|Beneficiary interviews","Liberia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAL663A.pdf","5,286 KB","001866 - Institute of Public Administration|008570 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to support Fundacion Ecuatoriana para la Conservacion de la Naturaleza efforts to solve environmental problems in Ecuador.  Special evaluation covers the period 5/80-9/82 and is based on document review and interviews with A.I.D. and Fundacion personnel and with outside observers. The Fundacion has been very successful in accomplishing major objectives. Diagnostico, a 2-volume, 1,200-page country profile involving the cooperation of 14 specialists was a milestone. It includes an analytical framework for examining environmental problems, summarizes constraints to solving problems, and recommends solutions for environmental management.  Due to Diagnostico's limited distribution to only 240 policymakers, a second publication, Ecologia y Desarollo, an illustrated synthesis of Diagnostico, was drafted for wider dissemination. Progress was made toward the major objective of the environmental education project (EDUNAT).  Although the effect on audiences' attitudes and behaviors remains unclear, a variety of educational materials were produced.  Ambientales en el Ecuador was published on specific environmental problems.  A study of communications within environmental institutions in Quito, Guayaquil, and Cuenca was conducted through 240 staff interviews.  Education was also promoted through a series of informative wall posters, newspaper releases, a monthly Natura newsletter, articles for the internal publications of 40 institutions, a series of radio programs, and five films and five slide shows for use on T.V., in movie theaters, and during conferences. Two one-week seminars were held, respectively, for journalists and Jaycee leaders.  Two hands-on demonstration forestry projects, although deviating from Natura's education objectives, were technically successful; one has been refunded by another donor. Recommendations are made to:  (1) remedy technical flaws in educational materials; (2) develop long-term plans for conducting educational activities; and (3) develop explicit plans for building the Fundacion into a permanent institution.","Attached to PD-AAL-791","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-2085-00","","9/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Environmental research|Environmental policy|Environmental planning|Private voluntary organizations|Ecology","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAL791A.pdf","30,011 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the Government of Kenya's (GOK's) capacity to plan and implement health programs and policies, especially in rural areas. Special evaluation covers the period 7/79-7/82 and is based on document review, discussions with GOK and USAID/K officials, and site visits. Project objectives are being met despite the GOK's reluctance to establish a formal planning entity in the Ministry of Health (MOH), as called for in the project agreement. The project has increased awareness of planning issues. A Health Planning Steering Committee and a Health Planning Working Group (HPWG) have been created and both units are actively involved in health planning at all levels of the MOH; it is hoped that the informal HPWG will evolve into the desired formal entity. Planning to date has focused on the health sector portion of the GOK's next 5-year development plan. Participant training and planning workshops and seminars have been carried out essentially as specified, but not all M.S. trainees were sent to appropriate U.S. institutions. Obstacles to staffing and retaining planners in the MOH (public service regulations prevent separate career ladders for health planners, as intended) must be resolved. The contractor, Drew Postgraduate Medical School, has provided an able Chief of Party, but his effectiveness has been limited by insufficient professional and administrative support and by difficulties relating to disagreement between the GOK and A.I.D concerning the GOK's failure to establish a formal planning unit. Drew's financial and procurement management have not been adequate, however, and only 19 months (70 planned) of long-term technical assistance (TA) have been provided. Due to the lack of a long-term health information specialist, data needed for health planning have not been organized in a cohesive manner. Finally, only 33% of funds have been expended with 58% of time elapsed. A 2-year project extension is recommended, with more emphasis on policy analysis and formulation and on incorporating provincial and district plans into an overall health plan. Other recommendations address MOH staffing, training, and information needs, as well as project management and TA needs.","Attached to PD-AAM-483","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Health care planning|Health policy|Institution building|Government departments","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAM483A.pdf","2,648 KB","000369 - Charles R.

"Evaluates integrated rural development project in Mauritania's Guidimaka region.  Special evaluation covers the period 6/80-3/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project officials and beneficiaries. Despite delays due to inadequate procurement and logistical planning and the financial and managerial weaknesses of the first TA contractor, progress has been good.  Cultural trials in l981 yielded sharp increases in sorghum and cowpeas, while trials of improved cultural practices increased crop yields by 50% and helped, in conjunction with the provision of improved seed and nursery plants and water development activities, in promoting vegetable gardening.  The use of animal traction, especially for plowing, improved yields by 15% and led to expanded cultivated hectarage.  Promising work has been carried out in forestry and in range management but need to be complemented, respectively, by village level extension efforts and by a national policy to promote controlled access to land.  The project team has worked patiently to make the new small-scale, self-help projects component - which has had notable success in developing water resources and which should serve as a model for development activities in Mauritania - acceptable to villagers, although its trial efforts to promote women's participation in the project have failed.  Animal health efforts, constrained by the lack of TA for long periods, have included creation of a revolving fund for the purchase of veterinary supplies at the village level. The success to date of the project, which has already become an institution responsible for large allocations of resources and manpower, stems largely from the mutual cooperation among expatriate technicians, their counterparts, and regional and national authorities.  Future efforts should stress indigenization of the project and development of a less costly extension methodology.  Expansion of activities beyond the project's small scope will depend on Mauritania's capability to support recurrent costs. Key recommendations are to:  update the project's financial plan and consider a project extension using existing resources; develop a plan to collect and analyyze sociological data; and strengthen counterpart training.","Attached to PD-AAM-487","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Crop production|Integrated rural development|Agronomy|Rangeland|Agricultural research|Livestock|Reforestation|Agricultural extension|Animal health|Indigenization|Beneficiary interviews","Mauritania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAM487A.pdf","5,106 KB","008576 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve and expand rural preventive and promotive health services in Lesotho.  Special evaluation covers the period 2/80-4/82 and is based on interviews with project, Government of Lesotho (GOL), and USAID/L personnel and with health workers. Progress toward project objectives has been impressive.  Legislation formalizing a new category of primary health care (PHC) workers - nurse clinicians (NC's) - is in the final stages of approval.  A high-quality NC training program was established, 22 graduates have been deployed in rural areas, and a second class of 19 NC's is now in training.  A nurse tutorial staff is being recruited to replace the expatriate NC trainers and a practical management component for the NC curriculum was developed. Also developed were decentralized PHC management support systems, village health worker training materials, and a Health Planning and Statistics Unit (HPSU) within the Ministry of Health (MOH). There is concern, however, that the NC training program is too intense and that the planned training of NC's at a university will jeopardize the project's practical approach.  National counterparts for two expatriate NC trainers have not been designated and training of NC support staff has not begun.  Some NC posts have not been established, NC grade and pay scales are inappropriate, and the MOH and private health organizations disagree over the placement and pay of NC's.  In addition, factors relating to the retention of NC's have not been fully addressed. Health planning has been difficult because the GOL's budget does not match its stated health policies, several HPSU management positions have not been filled, and the HPSU director has been preoccupied with donors. Procedures for reviewing and implementing donor projects and a system for cooperation between the MOH and other GOL agencies involved in such projects have not been established.  Management of supply operations and supply links to health centers are weak, reliable transport is lacking at all levels, and responsibility for maintaining health facilities and equipment has not been assigned.  Finally, at the health service area level, candidates have not been recruited for planned administrative positions.  Detailed recommendations address these issues.","Attached to PD-AAL-792","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Health care|Health outreach services|Health care administration|Nurses","Lesotho","","","","","008569 - USAID.

"Korea's phenomenal economic growth since 1963 is the subject of an eight-volume study prepared by the Korea Development Institute (KDI) and Harvard Institute for Economic Development.  The study findings (seven volumes have been published to date) are herein reviewed in an analysis focusing on the replicability of the Korean experience and on the extent to which A.I.D. assistance has contributed to Korean success. In chapters covering, in turn:  historical and cultural factors in Korean development; rural development; trade, industry, and finance; entrepreneurship; foreign aid; education; population, urbanization, and health; and income distribution, the author shows that Korea cannot be considered a model for other developing countries, partly because of its unique culture and history (which have both positively and negatively influenced development) and partly because development has occurred in a way and a setting that directly contradict current A.I.D. priorities: e.g., economic growth resulted from intensive export promotion benefiting urban dwellers rather than the rural poor; Korea remains a highly centralized, nonparticipatory society; private enterprise is weak and cooperatives, labor unions, and commercial banks are government-controlled; women's status is low; neither income distribution nor public health have been primary goals of the Korean Government; and education, while open to society as a whole, in practice serves to reconfer prestige on an established elite. U.S. assistance, the author concludes, has been of only peripheral value in Korea's development, having been more effective at the project than the policy level; P.L. 480 aid has in fact inadvertently deterred grain pricing reforms.  The training abroad of Koreans has perhaps been the most significant U.S. contribution.  Several recommendations are made regarding future priorities for A.I.D. assistance in Korea, and the implications of the Korean experience for A.I.D. development strategies are drawn. Regarding the KDI-Harvard study itself, the author finds it an important analysis, but limited by its sole focus on economic development and its neglect of such critical factors as competition with North Korea, world market conditions, and the role of the military.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Development strategies|Economic development|Foreign assistance|Development programs|Development program evaluation","Korea R","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ177.pdf","1,542 KB","000156 - USAID.

"The often criticized Vicos Cornell-Peru project - an action-oriented research program to improve the quality of life in a highland hacienda community in Peru - was one the earliest efforts to bring about planned social change in the developing world.  The author of this study interprets data on the project from an anthropological viewpoint, presenting a comprehensive analysis of the project's background, interventions, and results. During the period 1952-65, the Vicos project aimed to increase Vicosinos' status and self-esteem by undertaking a broad range of activities, e.g., the introduction of improved potato seeds, technology, and a credit package, other agricultural activities, educational improvements, health and nutrition programs, military recruitment, and the creation of new political institutions.  Although many of these efforts succeeded, positive impacts were mitigated by a variety of unintended effects. Potato production increased dramatically, leading to increased cash and commerce in the community and better diets; however, as the new technologies were available only to wealthier Vicosinos, the relative position of smallholders declined.  Educational improvements increased literacy, Spanish speaking ability, and opportunities for secondary schooling, but lowered the status of women (due to unequal educational opportunities) and of the aged (as educated children took stronger roles in household decisionmaking); jobs for the secondary school graduates were scarce in Vicos. Regularization of Vicosinos' military status led to the creation of a power bloc of veterans, generally committed to social and economic innovation, which tended to weaken kinship institutions and traditional elites.  Traditional authority was further weakened by the (largely successful) transfer of political power to elected delegates and a governing body of literate Vicosinos.  The project did improve Vicosinos' self-esteem and their position outside the community, but it also increased their status and role ambiguities. The author concludes that project success (qualified though it was) was due to the anthropological sensitivity of key project staff and that project willingness to work with existing Peruvian institutions increased the transferability of Vicos innovations within Peru.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAC-0044-C-00-1023-00","","4/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Community development|Integrated rural development|Cultural anthropology|Agricultural development|Education|Social change","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ616.pdf","4,221 KB","003052 - USAID.

"In 1966, A.I.D. initiated a project to establish a major multidisciplinary agricultural research center at Tha Phra in Northeastern Thailand.  This report summarizes the project's setting and activities, describes its impacts, and presents lessons learned. Project experience was mixed.  An excellent physical facility was built, 118 scientists received U.S. training, and a substantial research program (although not sufficiently linked to farmers' needs) was developed at the Center.  However, since the project ended in 1975, research programs have been reduced and many Center employees have been absorbed into other units of Thailand's Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives.  Present research is routine, laboratory- or station-focused. Bureaucratic conflict has created an atmosphere in which research done at the Center is often rejected out of hand by central Ministry units.  On the other hand, a variety of creative outreach programs, deserving of modest A.I.D. support, have been undertaken by the Center since the project ended.  These include television and radio programs, a mobile extension unit, and an agricultural information network. USAID/T officials were in a position to recognize the Center's bureaucratic impotence well before the project ended, but failed to take action to either strengthen the Center's bureaucratic position, support only promising (e.g., training) components, or withdraw support completely.  Project experience shows that institutional development projects must fit the existing bureaucratic structure and be flexible enough to allow for major readjustments; that advisors and funds provided under technical assistance contracts may shield a project from direct bureaucratic opposition only as long as they are present; and that A.I.D. procedures and incentive structures do not promote investigation, analysis, and action to solve implementation problems. The following remedial measures are recommended:  a detailed, retrospective review of A.I.D professional development work every 5 years; project review for mid-course correction every 2 years; and division of large complex projects into modules to provide more flexible options.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Agricultural education|Research facilities|Institution building","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ615.pdf","1,359 KB","000156 - USAID.

"If the Kenya Radio Correspondence Project - established in 1967 to upgrade the qualifications of primary school teachers through correspondence courses and radio instruction - had a flaw, it was that it was too successful.  Thus concludes this impact evaluation of the project, which trained 5,000 teachers during the 4 years of A.I.D. involvement and 7,000 thereafter, and allowed Kenyans to pursue educational certification without the personnel or system costs of formal schooling, a method of great potential value to developing countries, and applicable in many fields. Unfortunately, the resulting numerous teacher promotions and salary increases, coupled with the hiring of some 5,000 new teachers annually, strained Kenya's education budget and led in 1974 to the government's abandoning the automatic promotion policy which had motivated many teachers to join the program. Enrollments fell drastically, and although the project-created Correspondence Course Unit (CCU) at the University of Nairobi survived as an institution, its operations and client services deteriorated.  In an effort to increase enrollment, the CCU turned to commercial courses which were not in keeping with long-range socially sound objectives.  Nonetheless, the CCU has demonstrated its resilience and has been selected to provide new and significant distance teaching services, including programs in adult literacy, primary teacher updating, and primary education for nomadic peoples. The project taught that distance teaching requires well-organized field support in close touch with the target population; strong financial incentives for learners to invest time and money in courses; a reliable postal system; national radio transmission reaching most potential clients; a flexible institutional base with a corps of well-trained specialists; and a willingness to equitably distribute educational benefits to rural and disadvantaged groups.  (Educators should remember, however, the limitations of distance teaching for technical subjects.)  Other lessons learned are that A.I.D. Missions should keep in touch with assisted institutions after project completion, and that informal exchanges of information among developing countries about the distance teaching method can be extremely valuable.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Teacher training|Educational methods|Educational radio|Correspondence education","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ620.pdf","3,442 KB","000156 - USAID.

"In response to the U.S. government's emphasis on private sector initiatives in the development process, A.I.D.'s Bureau for Program and Policy Coordination has been investigating both A.I.D. and non-A.I.D. efforts to foster private enterprise as a means of increasing the resource base and momentum of development.  This paper presents preliminary findings of these studies. The first section, written from the entrepreneur's perspective, examines market processes and other key factors influencing the growth of private enterprise in developing countries.  Market size, specialization, and participants are considered as is the relationship between market size and enterprise size.  Among the other factors discussed are political systems and practices, governmental policy interventions, infrastructure, financial systems, sociocultural practices, and the availability of capital, business expertise, and technology. In Section II, the authors examine the effectiveness, and so far as possible, costs of specific approaches to fostering private enterprise. These approaches have tended to take two forms: policy reforms and specific programs/projects to directly assist private enterprise, the latter including feasibility studies, promotion of business ventures through the conference approach, business clearinghouses, trade fairs, management training, technology transfer, the development of infrastructure and financial systems, and capital assistance. The final section examines several private sector ventures which have had visible development benefits as a basis for identifying ways for A.I.D. to assess the impacts of existing and future programs.  The authors find that tools are needed for evaluating both the impact of many private enterprises on the economy as a whole and the impact of a single firm on its immediate environment. The authors conclude that (1) market mechanisms, when allowed to operate freely, will provide incentives to which the private sector will respond and (2) relatively small public sector investments can effectively stimulate private sector development resources.  An 8-page bibliography, and lists of pertinent A.I.D. projects, case studies, and evaluation publications are appended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Development strategies|Private enterprises|Marketing|Economic development","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ618.pdf","3,178 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Examination of the impact of a 17-year food grain technology project in Nepal (1957-74), presented in this report, provides both a sense of solid accomplishment and a basis for some disquieting fears. Project accomplishments include development of a functional and decentralized research system with five stations in the Tarai flatlands, training to B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. levels of almost 600 Nepali agricultural scientists, a sharp increase in farmers' awareness of the need for agricultural development, and the beginnings of a partnership between research and extension.  Technology packages including improved wheat, rice, and maize varieties were extended to Tarai farmers and farmer awareness of the new technology was found to be virtually universal. However, channels of communication between researchers and farmers - whose problems and priorities differ - are less open than they might be. Researchers urge adoption of demonstrably high-yield varieties, while farmers, who have adopted the new technology only selectively, worry about the risks involved and point out other needs, especially for reliable water and fertilizer supplies.  Further, the green revolution in Nepal has not yet led to long-term food security and economic independence as expected, but rather has contributed to economic and environmental destabilization.  Indeed, the potential for serious ecological deterioration associated with increasingly intensified cropping is enormous; stabilizing the process will require major changes in the coming decades.  Finally, the productivity of researchers, extensionists, farmers, and agricultural input agencies is far from optimal. The project has taught:  the need to understand farmers' needs, resources, and constraints in order to establish sound research priorities; the importance of off-station research, long-term research programs, and long-term environmental considerations; the inappropriateness of monopolies in the distribution of agricultural inputs when farmer demand is strong; and the decisive importance of close communication among researchers, extensionists, and farmers. Tarai-related discussions of farming systems, population pressure and agricultural change, and agricultural research and risk are appended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Cereal crops|Agricultural research|Agricultural technology|Agricultural extension|Agricultural production|Yield increase|Crop yield|Ecology","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ614.pdf","2,410 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates multidonor project to construct rural access roads in Kenya. Special evaluation covers the period 10/81-11/82 and is based on discussions held during a meeting of project donors. Progress has been mixed.  Road gravelling is 3,700 km behind schedule and the Kenyan Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) has not presented plans for clearing the backlog.  However, the MOTC has begun a study to determine which earth roads do not require gravelling, and has taken several steps to improve the management and effectiveness of gravelling operations.  In regard to road maintenance, contractors have been engaged and supervisory personnel trained and posted; maintenance overseers will be trained by the end of 1982.  Recurrent funds for FY83 routine maintenance, however, will cover only 60% of needs; sufficient funds must be allocated for future maintenance to ensure continued donor support.  Because of difficulties in procuring hand tools, a new tenderer has been called for.  Delays in the completion of a rural roads impact study have reduced its usefulness, but 13 associated studies and surveys are or will soon be available. Construction of bridges, culverts, and other structures, has been slow, especially in the Kakamega District.  Previous payment problems remain unsolved and have hampered gravelling operations in particular. General plans for extending the project methodology to the rehabilitation and maintenance of minor roads have been made. To facilitate completion of the impact study, the MOTC should obtain commitments from the Central Bureau of Statistics to provide needed data support and from a contractor whose services are critical to the study, and should make periodic progress reviews; the MOTC should also prepare terms of reference for a related marketing study and a position paper on the need for an impact study summary. Other recommendations are, inter alia, for the MOTC to:  reduce the number of earth construction sites to two per project unit; inventory and give priority to work on roads in need of rehabilitation; establish a pre-qualifying system for equipment tenderers; ensure that cash for the project is specifically earmarked within the disbursements to the Provincial Engineers Office; and establish a second bridge unit in Kakamega and possibly contract out some construction.","Attached to PD-AAM-666|Joint Donors Review and Evaluation of the Rural Access Roads|Programme, 6th (19-28 Oct 1982)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Roads|Rural areas|Gravel|Road construction|Bridge construction|Road maintenance","Kenya","","","005642 - Zimbabwe National Family Planning Council.

"The possibilities for improving the economic efficiency and profitability of milkfish farming in the Philippines by determining optimum input-output relationships are reported in this study, which uses the Cobb-Douglas production model to quantify the relative contributions of 11 supplementary inputs to milkfish output on 324 farms in seven provinces. Results show that inputs significantly related to milkfish output include stocking rates, pond age, operating costs, fertilizers, and farm size.  Optimum stocking rates for milkfish frys and fingerlings, and application rates for organic and inorganic fertilizers are calculated. The more efficient farms were found to be those which are larger, privately owned, and located in climatically propitious areas. The authors conclude that a more intense application of inputs, especially in deeper ponds, would yield much higher output and profits. The available economies of scale offer great potential for Philippine milkfish culture.  Farmers and policymakers could work to reorganize and restructure small units of production into larger, more efficient, and more profitable units without changing tenure status.  A case for group farming is presented and related to the Philippine government's scheme of fishpond estate development.  Improvements to existing assistance programs are also discussed.

"Evaluates project to expand family planning in Bangladesh by supporting Government of Bangladesh (BDG) and nongovernmental organization (NGO) programs.  Special evaluation covers the period FY 1981-82 and is based on interviews with key officials, document review, and site visits. The project, part of a multidonor effort, is contributing positively to the BDG Population Control and Family Planning (PCFP) program. Although contraceptive use - which may reach 32-33% by 1985, compared to a targeted 30% - has increased, the PCFP has been seriously hampered by inadequate BDG financing (due to adverse economic conditions), too frequent changes in direction (especially regarding integration of FP with health care), numerous personnel changes, and deficiencies in organization, administration, logistics, supply management, training, and supervision. The PCFP has overemphasized sterilization, at the expense of other types of contraception.  A.I.D. funding of local costs of the PCFP sterilization program (assumed in Spring 1981) has been temporarily withdrawn due to inadequate BDG efforts to ensure strict voluntarism; implementation of required procedures is improving.  The bulk of A.I.D. assistance to the PCFP has consisted of providing contraceptives and other supplies.  However, clients have been dissatisfied with AID-provided Noriday, attempts to integrate the PCFP with health care have disrupted supply reporting, and too little attention has been given to increasing BDG self-sufficiency in supply procurement and management. Training of physicians and other health and volunteer personnel has been hampered by lack of funds and qualified trainers, but overseas training has been of value.  Progress is being made with regard to PCFP contraceptive use surveys and operations research.  The Local Family Planning subproject has good potential for increasing local flexibility. Finally, USAID/B has provided high-quality assistance to NGO's, which have proven valuable sources of innovation and evidently have met their goal of accounting for 10% of contraceptive use. To meet FP goals in Bangladesh, high levels of aid, close collaboration among donors, and increased utilization of NGO's are needed, as well as increased attention to efforts to delay marriage age, and decrease desired family size.  Numerous recommendations address specific needs alluded to above.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","1/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Population policy|Population planning|National level|Government departments|Delivery systems","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM710.pdf","2,857 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","000191 - USAID.

"Evaluates U.S. Bureau of the Census (BuCen) POPSTAN project to help LDC's implement the 1980 round of censuses.  Special evaluation, prepared under project 9365900, covers the period 1978-82 and is based on document review, site visits with national officials and workshop participants, and interviews with staffs of BuCen, A.I.D., the UN Statistical Office, and the East-West Population Institute. Implementation has been good, but could be improved.  Of the 2,000 copies each of 7 POPSTAN and 2 mapping manuals developed, two-thirds were distributed in LDC's; these, especially the mapping manuals, were well received and were used for both training and reference purposes. However, preparation of the volumes took longer than expected because it took 2 years to develop a new outline that minimized repetition and compartmentalization and to develop a questionnaire acceptable to all parties.  As a result, the materials were not ready for 1980 census activities in many countries, although all but Volume F of the English-language versions were completed by 1981.  Despite some inadequacies, e.g., need for more LDC specificity, only selected parts of the materials need updating for the 1990 census round. BUCEN provided training for the 1980 census to a total of 289 LDC participants from 39 countries in workshops, mostly regional in nature, on POPSTAN, mapping materials, and specialized topics. In most cases (80%), workshops were held in time to be of help in the 1980 census, although a third of the African participants and 9 of the 10 Near East participants attended the workshops after their country's census.  BUCEN staff for the workshops were generally good, although improvement is needed in the special topics workshops, especially in the area of LDC census data analysis.  Indepth studies of workshops in Sierra Leone and the Philippines revealed several organizational problems, in particular the need to plan workshops, especially those in Africa, where project resources are wisely concentrated, in advance. Key recommendations are that BuCen improve both training materials and workshops; implement workshops in close collaboration with other groups, both within and without the Bureau, that provide census-related training; and improve budget planning and scheduling.","Evaluation period: 1978-1982","Special Evaluation","Documents","RS/COM-CEN-4-75","","12/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Population censuses|Planning|Technical training|Demography|Demographic data collection|Research methodology|Technical assistance|Manuals and handbooks|Workshops|Beneficiary interviews","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM682.pdf","2,830 KB","001318 - American Public Health Association.

"Evaluates the National Science Foundation's (NSF's) Scientists and Engineers in Economic Development (SEED) project to enhance the capability of university science and engineering programs in LDC's to help solve development problems.  Special evaluation covers the period 1972-79 and is based on a survey of SEED participants and a control group of scientists from other international NSF programs. In line with the reasons which led them to participate in the project, SEED scientists were successful in improving foreign research capabilities and strengthening relationships between foreign and U.S. research institutions.  While scientists in the control group spent most of their time collecting data for their own research and writing research papers, SEED scientists were primarily engaged in teaching or lecturing, developing better curricula for scientific institutions, and performing collaborative research both to improve foreign research capabilities and to link these improvements to social and economic goals.  Both groups of scientists agreed on the usefulness of NSF's international ventures and recommended the expansion of such activities.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Universities and colleges|Scientists|Research|International cooperation|Technical assistance|Limited data","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAM887.pdf","1,968 KB","002969 - Temple University.

"Evaluates the Pan American Development Foundation's (PADF) performance in AID-financed and other projects to promote private sector-sponsored national development foundations (NDF's) in Latin American and the Caribbean.  Special evaluation, prepared under project 5980044, covers the period 1973-82 and is based on document review, interviews with A.I.D. and NDF personnel, and site visits. Since 1973, SOLIDARIOS, an independently organized federation of NDF's originally supported by PADF, has taken over many PADF activities (such as providing member NDF's with credit and technical assistance); relations between the two entities, while recently improved, remain somewhat strained.  Further, from 1974-78 PADF did not work extensively to establish new NDF's, focusing instead on unrelated areas such as disaster relief and health services.  Subsequently, PADF returned to its major goal of supporting NDF's, but apparently without learning - from its own experience or that of successful NDF credit programs (e.g., the Dominican Republic NDF) - that successful NDF's:  do not try to impose the overly complex cooperative model of development on local groups; build on indigenous organizational forms, relying on group sanction and control for repayment; and do not try to pursue, simultaneously, the institutional goals of equity, efficiency, and viability.  In Costa Rica and especially in Haiti, however, overambitious and paternalistic PADF approaches imposed more demands than the NDF's were ready to meet, necessitating changes to emphasize viability and efficiency. Conversely, PADF support in Jamaica was appropriate and effective; the Jamaican NDF is very successful, with the capability to become self-sustaining soon. It is suggested that, contingent upon PADF adoption of a learning approach (spelled out in this report), PADF programs be funded by matching grants rather than OPG's, for several reasons - to allow the PADF to use its comparative advantage as a PVO to bring private businessmen together to develop NDF's in support of unsecured credit programs; to give USAID's and other donors time to decide if new NDF's are worth backing; and to make the PADF more accountable to A.I.D. and challenge it to secure additional funding from U.S. corporations.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAC-0044-C-00-2037-00","","9/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Foundations|National level|Private voluntary organizations|Small scale enterprises|Private enterprises|Financial institutions|Credit|Institution building|Development organizations|Beneficiary interviews","Costa Rica|Haiti|Jamaica|Belize|Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM702.pdf","2,210 KB","008537 - USAID.

"Evaluates pilot project to upgrade the Egyptian Ministry of Health's (MOH) urban health delivery system.  Special evaluation covers the period 11/78-8/82 and is based on document review, interviews with project officials and beneficiaries, and inspection of project construction. Designed to improve health service delivery, the project has focused on constructing, renovating, and equipping facilities, these activities consuming 70% of project expenditures to date. Despite this emphasis, construction/renovation activities are behind schedule and the project's overall disbursement rate is low.  If recommendations made in the evaluation are implemented, however, all planned construction should be completed by the project's end. Service-oriented aspects of the project have lagged, making it unlikely that the project will substantially improve the population's health status or MOH health service delivery. Achievements have included the training of 2,000 MOH and other project personnel in-country and the training of one long- and 65 short-term participants out-of-country. However, the training itself has not been skills focused and of 356 MOH staff interviewed by Egypt's Experimental Center for Training on Evaluation of Social Programs (ECTOR) during its urban health sector assessment only 46 claimed to have received formal training in the last 5 years (a discrepancy possibly due to the large staff turnover at maternal/child health facilities). Further, there is no sign that the MOH has institutionalized the methodology developed by ECTOR for the critically necessary data gathering and planning activities.  Problems have been largely due to a too complicated, overly ambitious, unrealistic, and inappropriate project design and a project management that is highly centralized, does not provide incentives, and lacks basic management tools. Despite problems, A.I.D. assistance to the project should continue; there is still some chance the project might improve health services. Specific recommendations are to reorganize the project as several independent subprojects and to reorganize the project's central office; reemphasize service-oriented components; and develop innovative ways to overcome insufficient operating budgets.","Attached to PD-AAM-699|Evaluation period: 18 Aug-24 Sep 1982","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Health delivery|Pilot projects|Urban areas|Health facilities|Beneficiary interviews","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAM699A.pdf","3,257 KB","008539 - USAID.

"Evaluates first phase of a project to provide mobile primary health care services in Kenya's Kitui District.  Final external evaluation covers the period 8/81-9/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with community members, beneficiaries, health personnel, and project staff. The four mobile clinics have identified receptive, needy communities in remote areas of Kitui District and have provided regular, reliable welfare and immunization coverage for infants and young children, pre-natal care for pregnant mothers, and nutritional and health education.  While failure to conduct the planned baseline surveys has led to inadequate data on the project's impact, a general survey found increased use of the clinics, requests for more frequent visits, and recognition of the importance of childhood immunizations and pre-natal care.  Immunization coverage has rapidly increased and is now between 65% and 78% (much better than the national figures), according to the 1982 household survey.  Of those immunized, 40% use mobile clinics, 35% use Mission-run static facilities, and 23% attend Ministry of Health (MOH) static facilities.  Pre-natal coverage by the mobile clinics is also quite high. Although there are encouraging signs of multisectoral participation through multipurpose development committees at locational and even sublocational levels, the project has been clinic- rather than community-based.  Community involvement has been limited; health education has been too brief to effect significant changes in health knowledge and practices; virtually no community leaders have been trained; and only initial attempts have been made to train women. Funding of a 3-year Phase II of the project, focusing on promoting the involvement of communities and other sectors, is recommended.  In the planned integration of Phase II with the MOH health project, continued participation by the Diocese of Kitui is highly desirable. Further, since costs per beneficiary will rise to unacceptable levels under the MOH program, efforts should be made to maximize cost-effectiveness through increased coverage.  Other recommendations include seeking seconded MOH employees immediately; institutionalizing training efforts, especially for women; and expanding family planning activities.","Attached to PD-AAM-727","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Health delivery|Mobile health services|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","Kenya","","","001661 - Coordination in Development, Inc.","","008565 - USAID.

"Provides final Mission report (1975-9/82) on a project to institutionalize an agricultural management capability in the Government of Ghana's (GOG) Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). Despite the MOA's inability to release as many staff members for training as targeted (due to the departure from Ghana of many mid- and upper-level managers) and despite deteriorating in-country economic and political conditions, the project succeeded in developing a relatively self-sustaining management capability in the MOA.  All three project training programs - the 2-week Annual Regional Management Seminars (ARMS) at Kwadaso Agricultural College, the 9-12 month Diploma in Agricultural Administration (DAA) program at the Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration, and the Masters in Agricultural Administration (MAA) program at the University of Ghana, Legon - were implemented with the help of U.S. technical assistance (which was several months late in arriving).  The MAA program has been discontinued with the end of A.I.D. support, but the GOG is still supporting the other two programs, which are integral parts of the MOA's management training.  The ARMS component has perhaps been the project's most successful; the seminars were conducted by full-time Ghanaian trainer/consultants, each of whom had received AID-funded overseas training.  Eleven other Ghanaians received participant, mostly U.S., training during the course of the project. Severe economic problems made construction of a new structure at Kwadaso College infeasible (an underutilized campus building was renovated instead) and prevented the MOA from meeting all its financial requirements.  Specifically, training operations were delayed or frustrated by the MOA's failure to provide quarterly financial encumbrances on schedule; adequate funds were consistently lacking for such expenses as food at residential seminars and building maintenance; and a shortage of foreign exchange caused travel and clearance problems for overseas training participants. Prior to the mid-term evaluation, MOA managerial support was inadequate; the situation improved thereafter.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Agricultural management|Agricultural training|Limited data","Ghana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM744.pdf","156 KB","002513 - National Demonstration Water Project","","","English","application/pdf","Final EOPS","","","Agricultural management","Sep 1982","","","","Agricultural management development project","","PD-AAM-744","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc4NjIz","Ghana","6410070"

Four project mechanisms used by A.I.D. to support fisheries and aquaculture are reviewed.  Detailed analysis is made of the Korean Fisheries Revitalization Program (1956-64), which was directly funded and supervised by A.I.D. in-country, and of 211(d) fisheries and aquaculture programs at the University of Rhode Island and Auburn University (1969-79).  Less detailed analysis is presented of projects in which A.I.D. played a minor role in assisting fisheries development projects implemented by an international or regional entity, e.g., the Guinean Trawler Survey (1962-66), the East African Freshwater Fisheries Organization Project (1967-72), or by a foreign government, e.g., in the Philippines and India (1952-62).  Successful programs, it is noted, have featured, on the side of host countries, good resource bases, a traditional importance of fish in the local diet and economy, and strong governmental commitment.  Key U.S. ingredients have been major financial backing and long-term commitments, stress on programs encompassing all aspects of a fishery, provision of expert and experienced advisors, cooperation with local institutions, and flexible administration. It is recommended that the United States provide fisheries assistance to developing countries on both humanitarian and politically strategic grounds and because of the United States's perhaps unique technical and institutional capability.  It is also recommended that A.I.D., which should remain the primary sponsor and coordinator of U.S. assistance programs:  remove fisheries programs from the agricultural office; develop a fisheries headquarters and field staff and a coherent fisheries strategy; use universities for expertise not readily available in-house; and focus assistance on fisheries management, capture fisheries, and aquacultural activities.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Fisheries|Aquaculture|Development program evaluation|Development project design|Technical assistance","Korea R|Philippines|India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAN028.pdf","6,314 KB","002634 - National Research Council.

"Evaluates project to support efforts of U.S. and indigenous PVO's to promote local development in Sri Lanka.  Special evaluation covers the period 7/79-4/83 and is based on document review, interviews with project officials, and site visits. The project is well organized, well managed, and on target.  Balanced support has been provided to both U.S. and indigenous PVO's (with the former benefiting the latter through motivation and technical skills), and the subprojects (SP's),  which have been carefully reviewed, have all targeted the rural poor.  Exceptionally high Government of Sri Lanka (GSL) interest has been of great value. Of 11 current SP's, which have fallen well within the 8 targeted areas (with many SP's addressing several objectives), 4 are completed, 5 in progress, and 2 not yet begun.  Major success stories include the Overseas Education Fund of the League of Women Voters/GSL Women's Bureau SP, aimed at providing extension services for rural women in family health and income-generation, which has produced most of the project's 2,200 income increases, and the Sri Lanka Technical Institute/Diyagala Boys' Town SP, which provided 368 young men with excellent training in livestock breeding.  Other highlights include the Lanka Mahila Samithi SP, aimed at motivating rural women in family health, which has produced, at low per capita cost, over 75% of the project's 37,896 direct beneficiaries; the major stress placed on increased agricultural production and on women in development (the latter receiving sole emphasis in 5 SP's); the improvement of community self-help capabilities in 3 SP's (although the capability for self-sustaining SP's is not yet in evidence); and substantive progress in the areas of health education, family planning, and installation of drinking wells, bathing wells, and latrines.  A key problem is the inadequacy of quantitative data in PVO evaluations of SP's for determining beneficiary impact and cost-benefit ratios; new guidelines are needed. Project extension for at least another 5 years is recommended, as is the prioritizing of objectives in future programming and the analysis of successful SP's for possible replication on a larger scale.  The simplified standard provisions developed for Sri Lanka PVO grants should be studied by AID/W and Missions elsewhere.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Rural development|Women in development|Community participation|Beneficiary count|Limited data plus","Sri Lanka","","","008606 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to support efforts of Volunteers in Technical Assistance (VITA) to provide technical information to LDC's. Special evaluation covers the period 9/78-2/82 and is based on document review, interviews with VITA and A.I.D. personnel, and three visits to Honduras. The A.I.D. grant helps VITA perform a unique service and meet specific needs that would otherwise not be met.  VITA's Inquiry Service has received an increasing number of requests each year (all of which are answered), the majority (77% in 1981) of them from LDC nationals. Evaluation forms returned by VITA clients show the Service's value to users, especially in terms of speed and efficiency.  During site visits the evaluator observed a number of pieces of equipment and/or techniques adapted from VITA publications and documents and visited a complete documentation center in Tegucigalpa which utilzies VITA materials.  VITA has trained LDC nationals in opening highly successful indigenous documentation centers.  Internally, VITA has established a well-run program for its 3,700 volunteers and has developed successful internal monitoring and document and records management systems. However, a few problem areas were noted.  Many volunteers, while fully committed to their work, believed they are underutilized by VITA. Gender bias was noted in VITA literature and presentations, with only men portrayed as beneficiaries of VITA assistance and little done to target women as an audience.  As most VITA clients are literate and technically able, the poor and illiterate are for the most part not directly reached by VITA. Although response time to requests has been steadily reduced, fewer individualized responses have been sent. Prepackaged responses are most often remitted, the generality of which does not always meet clients' specific needs.  Other problems are the lack of local language materials and the poor quality of some of the documents remitted. It is recommended that A.I.D. continue to provide institutional support to VITA (including funding for VITA publications if copyright issues can be settled) and explore with VITA ways to pursue technology transfer at the individual level.  VITA is urged to redress the difficulties noted above.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0100-S-00-2025-00","","2/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Appropriate technology|Private voluntary organizations|Institution building|Information dissemination|Scientific information|Technical information|Technology transfer|Technical assistance|Beneficiary interviews","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM930.pdf","758 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Onsite evaluation|Indepth evaluation","","Anderson, Mary B.","","Feb 1982","","","","Provision of technical information and assistance to developing countries : an evaluation of the AID institutional support grant to Volunteers in Technical Assistance (VITA)","","PD-AAM-930","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc5MTQ5","Private and Development Cooperation","9380157"
"Evaluates project to improve production and marketing opportunities among small farmers and rural entrepreneurs in Costa Rica.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/80-9/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with Government of Costa Rica (GOCR) and project staff and with beneficiaries. Due to a weak economy and lack of GOCR institutional and financial support (GOCR funding was only 25% of the amount budgeted), the planned integral rural development strategy was no longer possible.  As a result, the logframe was revised in 5/81 and the implementor, Accion Internacional Tecnica (AITEC) expanded its staff and focused on assisting 37 specific agricultural projects in 5 of the 6 originally targeted areas, working closely with local development groups and cooperatives.  Survival of these groups - one has the potential to help plan, coordinate, and promote rural development projects - will depend on their success in maintaining linkages with GOCR agencies. A total of 43 AITEC and GOCR personnel (vs. 30 targeted) were trained in AITEC's development methodology, but of the 23 remaining with the project only 4 are GOCR staff.  The GOCR has discontinued the internal administrative systems that it initially established with AITEC assistance.  Local institutionalization of the AITEC methodology has been more successful, due largely to AITEC's excellent relationships with local groups. Entrepreneur training, targeted for 130 persons, was provided to only 54 (25 carpenters and 29 female artisans) because AITEC decided to emphasize farmer training.  A total of 907 farmers (500 were targeted) participated in short courses, field trips, and technical assistance sessions in such areas as apiculture, tree nurseries, basic grains, biogas, and coffee production; AITEC also distributed pamphlets on farming techniques.  More than 360 project participants increased their incomes by more than the targeted 15% and 200 new jobs were generated. While project participants were generally pleased, they felt that AITEC should do more to supply management training and explore marketing alternatives before encouraging production increases. AITEC is optimistic that other funding will be available when A.I.D. support ends in 3/83.  Nine recommendations are made to remedy project deficiencies and ensure sustainability of results.","Attached to PD-AAM-970","Special Evaluation","Documents","235-82","","10/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Agricultural production|Small scale enterprises|Development project design|Development project implementation|Development project evaluation|Beneficiary interviews","Costa Rica","","","","","008533 - USAID.

"Evaluates multidonor project to strengthen and expand the credit union (CU) movement in Togo.  Special evaluation covers the period 7/80-3/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with A.I.D., Peace Corps, Government of Togo, and local and national CU personnel. The AID-financed portion of the project has stimulated enthusiasm and expectation in Togo's previously stagnant CU movement. Several project outputs already exceed targets.  The project has increased CU membership by 1,200 persons (to 5,000, some 25% of whom are women), expanded the number of local CU's to 97 (most in impoverished rural areas), increased average savings per CU member to $98, and provided short-term (3,119 trainee-days at 57 courses) and on-the-job training to 734 National CU Association (CONAUDEC) staff, field agents, and local CU members in accounting, credit and office management, planning, and promotion; field agents were trained as trainers, a technology already successful in other LDC's.  Major focus has been on improving CONAUDEC's and local CU's accounting and budgeting; a revised accounting system has been installed at CONAUDEC and standard documentation for the system is being used by the CU's.  CONAUDEC has increased its field staff from 5 to 10 agents, and has held 8 promotion seminars for local CU's.  Much of the project's success can be attributed to the dedication of an AID-provided technician, who has worked with both CONAUDEC and local CU's. The chief constraint on the project is that neither CONAUDEC nor the local CU's are legally recognized as cooperatives; hence, their functions, and, in the case of CONAUDEC, revenues, are limited. Revision of the CONAUDEC and CU bylaws to achieve this recognition is essential.  Also, a full-time Togolese managing director is needed to supervise CONAUDEC's daily operations.  The targeted national CU development plan has not yet been completed, but will be produced before project end, with the technician's help.  It is recommended that the project be extended as needed to allow the technician to complete a full 30-month tour. Significant external technical and financial support will continue to be needed for 8-10 years, until the CU movement is better organized and self-sufficient.  Further recommendations address issues discussed above.","Attached to PD-AAM-971","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Credit unions|Institution building|Accounting|Technical training|Financial records systems|Credit|Management training|Beneficiary count","Togo","","","008614 - USAID.

"Evaluates OPG to Project Hope (HOPE) to train health workers in St. Lucia and other Eastern Caribbean countries.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/80-10/82 and is based on document review, interviews with project and other concerned officials and with project trainees, and site visits. Results have been mixed.  In the environmental health services component, extensive infrastructure and a high-quality staff have been assembled at St. Lucia's Morne Complex and a training program has been designed for environmental health officers (EHO's). Ten St. Lucia sudents have been trained and 29 others from 7 countries are in training. In the second component, HOPE has trained 40 St. Lucian environmental health aides (EHA's), all of them now employed by the Government, which plans to continue the program on its own.  Project-funded EHA training in Antigua may commence within the next year. Infrastructure is now in place at the Morne Complex for the dental health services component for St. Lucian personnel, but the program has been notably modified.  Dental nurses' training was terminated in 5/82 - the two trainees will complete their studies in Trinidad - and dental hygienist training was expanded to include other countries; 6 hygienists were trained and a seventh audited the course.  The hygienists offered public dental health programs during their training as planned, but no new trainees have been recruited and lack of a plan to utilize the hygienists makes it unclear whether any will be. The proposed regional child care services component has been dropped as not consonant with the OPG. Although problems posed by HOPE staff turnover and the late arrival of books and equipment seem to have been overcome, external concerns such as costs, host governments' commitments and capabilities, and the related issues of program certification and students' professional credentials (in EHO training) have called the project design into question.  A cost-effectiveness study of the EHO program and alternative programs in the region will be conducted in 11/82, and a financial review of the project undertaken.  The use of remaining funds for a proposed pediatric training/service program through the University of the West Indies and HOPE is being considered.","Attached to PD-AAM-980 (PES)|Evaluation period: Aug 1980-Oct 1982","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Medical education|Health professional education|Health professionals|Health workers|Assistants|Private voluntary organizations|Environmental aspects|Dentistry|Paramedical education|Degree equivalence|Beneficiary interviews","Caribbean|West Indies|Eastern Caribbean|Saint Lucia","","","","","001757 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the capacity of the Government of Lesotho's (GOL) Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) to protect and increase the productivity of farm and rangeland resources. Special evaluation covers the period 9/81-12/82 and is based on document review, interviews with MOA and technical personnel, and site visits. The project, which enjoys strong GOL support, a highly competent technical team, and active participation by village committees and farmers, is on track, but achievement of some targets may be imperiled by GOL financial difficulties (limiting fuel and personnel budgets) and by further staffing problems due to decentralization of MOA divisional staff and the absence of staff receiving training.  Seven conservation area plans encompassing 9,651 ha have been completed; plans for another 5,500 ha are in progress.  Soil mapping, prerequisite to conservation planning, has been completed on only 12,000 ha, indicating a need to modify mapping focus and intensity.  Preparation of on-farm plans is ahead of schedule, but MOA decentralization has impeded the formation of planning teams and may hinder follow-up actions to assess the plans' utility to farmers.  Construction of soil conservation structures is providing jobs to about 50 men. A demonstration range management area (RMA) - the Sehlabethebe dip tank area - has been selected and a grazing association (legal status is pending) organized, but the RMA's size (34,000 ha including 8 times the number of animal units projected) may necessitate additional inputs, construction and aerial surveying are behind schedule (the latter due to a decision to use color photos), a counterpart field operations specialist is lacking, and action to discourage trespassing herders is needed.  Animal health and marketing programs are being planned; the feasibility of planning a second RMA should be reviewed.  Substantial progress has been made in analyzing range policy and suggesting new regulations. Long-term U.S. training is ahead of schedule, with 13 Basotho selected (12 aleady studying), but only one person has received short-term U.S. training, training for 3 others having been deferred until 1983.  A study tour was conducted (25 participants), and in-country courses were held for 30, 30, and 20 participants, respectively.  More inservice training and management training for long-term trainees are needed.","Attached to PD-AAN-011","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource conservation|Soil conservation|Grazing land|Agricultural land|Range management|Livestock|Agricultural planning|Limited data plus","Lesotho","","","008569 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish a subprofessional, mid-level, skills-oriented agricultural training institute in Liberia. Special evaluation covers the period 8/77-2/83 and is based on document review, interviews with Government of Liberia (GOL) officials and project personnel, and Rural Development Institute (RDI) student, faculty, and staff questionnaires. RDI was established at Cuttington University College (CUC) as a 2-year agricultural technology college with an enrollment of 200 high school graduates per year; 90% of the students in RDI's first two graduating classes were placed in agricultural jobs. The curriculum, which includes classroom instruction, laboratory work, and field experience in animal production, tree crops, and fruit, cereal, and vegetable crops, has expanded from general plant science courses to include academic majors in plant, animal, and soil science and in agricultural engineering. Due to poor project design and misunderstanding about grantee and GOL contributions, RDI has not attained technical and financial self-sufficiency.  A small library and reading room were built, but no books or publications were provided; CUC's library, which RDI was to share, lacks materials on agriculture.  Laboratories were built but not provided with equipment, materials, and supplies; teaching aids were also lacking.  Due to failure to properly plan and fund participant training, there is a large short-fall of qualified Liberian staff. Additional physical facilities are also needed; sharing of facilities between RDI and CUC has benefited the latter at least as much as the former. A Phase II extension is required to allow RDI to achieve self-sufficiency, and to protect a substantial A.I.D. investment. The curriculum should be restricted to a manageable scope and reorganized to once again emphasize general plant sciences. Academic majors should no longer be offered; students should realize they are being trained primarily for field positions. Liberian staff should be recruited and trained to fill all faculty positions by the end of Year 4.  Since the GOL Ministry of Agriculture and its branches will be the greatest employers of RDI graduates, their interest and participation in the RDI program are crucial to its success.","Attached to PD-AAN-092","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural schools|Agricultural education|Agricultural training|Agricultural technicians|Beneficiary interviews","Liberia","","","008570 - USAID.

"Provides final Mission report (6/79-10/81) on a project to provide well-drilling equipment to help the Government of Botswana (GOB) meet national rural public water supply demands. The project was approved and funds allotted in only 3 months time. A.I.D. funds were used to purchase a Schramm T685H drilling rig (in operation by 10/79), a mud pump, a casing hammer, drill hammers and bits, and rig spares.  Also purchased, in 10/79, were a casing perforator, fishing tools, and drill collars, connectors and roller bits; a final order of rig spares was made in 10/81. The GOB contributed four trucks, a low-bed trailer, a water cart, two caravans, and other tools and equipment.  It also covered costs of a drilling crew, a maintenance contract with the equipment supplier, recurrent crew costs, and rig and support equipment, and of consultant hydrogeologists to assist in borehole siting.  A drilling instructor provided on-the-job training to 3 permanent and 13 temporary Batswana trainees assigned to the rig. Good performance of the rig has helped the GOB approach drilling goals.  That only 135 drilled boreholes were successful (54% of goal) is attributed the poor performance of older equipment and geological difficulties.  To alleviate this problem, GOB has requested A.I.D. financing of two additional Schramm rigs.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Wells|Small bore drilled wells|Water resources|Natural resource development|Water supply|Rural areas|Drilling|Limited data","Botswana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN112.pdf","88 KB","008516 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to create a permanent capacity within the Society for the Development and Exploitation of the Lands of the Delta and Valley of the Senegal River (SAED) for training personnel to maintain agricultural and construction equipment. Special joint evaluation covers the period 10/80-7/82 and is based in part on site visits. Progress has been very limited.  The only training provided has been a few short courses which were been organized by ORT (the contractor, acronym not identified) and provided by equipment suppliers.  Good farm equipment has been procured and most arrived early or on time, the beginnings of a supply management system are visible, a few perimeter workshops have been reorganized, and there is one counterpart who has a good relationship with an ORT technician. Outweighing these modest accomplishments are a multiplicity of deficiencies.  So little training has been provided because SAED changed the job descriptions of the ORT technicians, assigning them production rather than training roles.  SAED also failed to provide the counterparts, training facilities, training coordinator, and support personnel it had agreed to furnish. ORT, for its part, failed to take initiative in developing personal and professional relationships with those counterparts who were available.  When, in 6/81, SAED was persuaded to emphasize training over production, ORT produced an unsatisfactory training plan. The project has also suffered from:  SAED's informal and inconsistent management style; ORT's failure to provide orientation for its personnel and to produce timely workplans, training plans, budgets, and quarterly reports; the joint decision to send ORT personnel to Senegal before housing was available at the project site; construction delays; and a decision to relocate the central repair base.  The results have been frustration, demoralization, lack of mutual respect between Senegalese and ORT staff, confusion as to the relative priorities of various tasks and objectives, excessive preoccupation with the housing issue, and minimal transfer of knowlege and skills to the Senegalese.  No overseas training has been provided. Key recommendations are to place ORT personnel in greater proximity to their work and to assign counterparts able to devote most of their time to project tasks.","Evaluation period: Oct 1980-July 1982","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Equipment maintenance|Technical training","Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN113.pdf","3,316 KB","003406 - Aurora Associates, Inc.","","008600 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help reduce shortages in development manpower in the Sahel by training 400-500 Sahelians in priority areas.  Special evaluation covers the period 1979-82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with A.I.D. and host country officials and returned participants. Outputs generally fell short of target.  Only 315 Sahelians will complete training under the project, few of them women or from the private sector; the latter shortfall was due, inter alia, to the lack of highly developed private sectors in Sahelian countries and to host government monopolies in candidate recruitment and selection.  Little in-country and third country training were provided.  In-country English-language training (ELT) was offered in only three Francophone countries; as a result, few trainees were adequately oriented to U.S. life and U.S. ELT has increased long-term training costs by as much as 20%.  Further, the time allotted for training appears underestimated, and the problem of equivalency remains.  With few trainees returned to date, the program's actual impact cannot yet be assessed. Missions are generally too understaffed and inadequately organized to address the above-noted issues or the need for follow-up.  Further, AID/W's allocation of project funds on the basis of annual host country training plans prevents adequate long-range planning by Missions. Contrary to Project Paper guidelines, several Missions funded undergraduate academic programs and some funds were improperly used for bilateral project training.  The AID/W participant data base and tracking system lacked critical information and its data retrieval capabilities are of only limited help to Missions. On the plus side, country training plans have generally been consistent with host country and Mission development strategies, and the project has partially alleviated development constraints. Mission and host country personnel agree that the project serves as a useful and versatile development tool which needs to be available for future training programs outside of the project context. Fifteen principal recommendations are set forth in the areas of programming, management, and financial accountability.","Evaluation period: 21 May-Jun 1982","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Participants|Education for development|Language training|English language|Beneficiary interviews","Sahel","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN114.pdf","4,169 KB","","","000032 - USAID.

"Presents final contractor report (6/77-6/82) on a project to establish a rural, self-help process for practical training in health education (PTHE) in Cameroon. The project, executed in the districts of Mefore and Kadney, was impressive in achieving its objectives.  At the village level, 136 (of 240 targeted) village health committees were established and worked to improve springs, construct pit latrines, establish family pharmacies and village food markets, and provide nutrition education.  A total of 21 (of 40 targeted) health center workers were trained as itinerant agents and worked with 35 trained (vs. 30 targeted) PCV's to facilitate Ministry of Health (MOH)-project relations and as community organizers in 160 villages, covering a population of 50,000.  In 80 villages, committee days were held to demonstrate progress and conduct health education. These and planned inter- and intra-village contests to evaluate health-related improvements were curtailed due to poor MOH management.  The 18 project area health centers held regular staff development sessions, patient and group preventive health education, and prenatal clinics, and made sanitation available through community outreach. pre-service training in community organization was provided to 7 nursing faculty and 264 students of medium-level health training institutions.  Teachers from 10 (vs. 8 targeted) pilot primary schools received inservice health education training; a teachers' guide to health education was developed and tested.  Inservice training benefited 240 MOH personnel and 92 workers from other health services (82% of health personnel in the project areas); a trainers guide for inservice training in community health was produced.  Several seminars were conducted for MOH division and province-level staff and others.  An audiovisual aids center was set up but never became functional. Impediments to project success were due largely to MOH emphasis on outputs per se rather than on establishing a process of self-help in health improvement.  Lack of high-level MOH support, logistical problems, and difficulties stemming from personnel turnovers also hindered progress.  Nonetheless, the PTHE has been adopted by the MOH as a model for the National Program of Primary Health Care scheduled for start-up in 1982/3.","Attached to PD-AAN-209","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/afr-C-1432","","9/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Villages|Health education|Community self help|Health outreach services|Pilot projects|Medical education|Community health care|Community participation","Cameroon","","","","","008524 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop recommendations for improved farming systems through farm-based research in the Eastern Caribbean. Special evaluation covers the period through 4/8/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project participants. Although the project's ambitious objectives have not been fulfilled and many of the expected results not obtained, a sound infrastructure for farm-level applied research and extension has emerged, as farming systems research (FSR) has been readily embraced by farmers and has become the focal point of participating countries' agricultural research programs.  Joint country/Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI) teams have been established in 7 countries and some 25 farmer cooperators selected on each of the islands.  CARDI/FSR staff have become aware of the complex farming systems in the region, a number of production constraints have been discovered, on-farm adaptive problem-solving research has been initiated, and some observation trials conducted.  Also, various workshops and seminars have been conducted for research personnel. Progress has been hampered by a number of implementation problems, however.  The project has been spread too thin, geographically, to be effective.  Interterritorial communication has been poor and true interdisciplinary interaction among core CARDI personnel not achieved. Overemphasis on data collection and detailed analysis, coupled with a lack of flexibility, has led to a slow cautious approach to field trials.  In fact, the project has collected too much data, too rapidly, about a subsample of farmers which represents neither a homogenous group nor a random sample.  The project's ad hoc exploratory interventions (7-15 per country) represent constraints identified through informal observation, not during the data analysis process.  Thus, to date, project research has added little knowledge about or had little impact on farming systems. Included in this evaluation are analyses of crop and animal production in the Eastern Caribbean and of CARDI's organizational and functional patterns.  Detailed recommendations for Phase II of the project address these and other issues.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Farming systems research|Cropping patterns|Farms|Agricultural surveys|Data collection|Data analysis|Seminars|On farm research","Caribbean|West Indies|Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN228.pdf","1,981 KB","","","002845 - University of the West Indies at St. Augustine.

"Evaluates project to develop institutional capabilities in and conduct social science research in Cameroon.  Special evaluation covers the period 7/78-9/82 and is based on document review, interviews with project implementors and beneficiaries, and questionnaires administered during site visits. The project has largely failed to meet its objectives. Institutional weaknesses caused by the early split of the targeted Center for Economic and Social Sciences (CSES) into two autonomous centers including the Center for Economic and Demographic Research (CRED), personnel changes within the overseeing Institute of Human Sciences (ISH), limited monitoring by the project officer, and interinstitutional personnel clashes hindered project progress. Research was carried out and reports were produced on the effects of directed development in the Kaelp and Yagoua periphery, and baseline data were collected on cultural patterns in three subdivisions of Diamare.  However, planned state-of-the-art socioeconomic research in North Cameroon was not conducted. Moreover, due to conflicting role perceptions, there was little cooperation between U.S. and counterpart junior researchers, and a consequent minimal transfer of technology. Poorly qualified and changing research enumerators rendered research of questionable quality.  Lack of institutional linkages between concerned Government institutions, ministries, and development organizations and of dissemination of research results has limited the potential application of results. Research training was partially successful as field training and U.S. training were delivered to four of seven candidates; African short-term study was provided to three CSES staff as planned and one of two librarians was trained, but training for one ISH research administrator was not accomplished.  Farmers resented not receiving information and training in return for their cooperation during research. Project experience shows it is inappropriate to attempt to transfer technology through U.S. graduate students who are interested mainly in gathering material for their theses, and who in this instance were no more qualified than their Cameroonian counterparts. Recommendations address the above problems.","Attached to PD-AAN-258","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Socioeconomic aspects|Cultural research|Social science education|Research methodology|Technical training|Institution building|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Cameroon","","","","","008524 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the Societe de Developpement de l'Elevage dans la Zone Sylvo-Pastorale (SODESP) promote livestock production and range management among traditional herders in Senegal.  Special evaluation covers the period 12/78-12/82 and is based on document review and interviews with SODESP and USAID/S personnel and beneficiaries during site visits. Results in the project, which began 2 years late due to construction delays, have been mixed.  Livestock production is proceeding well:  a project zone headquarters and centers at the four permanent well sites have have been built and equipped and SODESP has already enrolled 59% of the total number of herders' cow-calf production units planned for the entire project.  The four deep wells rehabilitated by SODESP in the project zone are a powerful inducement to herders, and reforestation is proceeding well, although the species planted have little use for either construction or forage and training and TA funds have not been used.  A revolving credit fund to allow herders to purchase medicines has been established, but the medicines are usually unavailable, do not include nonprescription items, and there is no herder input in management.  A critical foodstuff supply is being distributed to well centers; plans for herder payments have been limited to in-kind (livestock) exchanges. Finally, no progress at all has been made in two activities of great importance to A.I.D. - range management and research and monitoring. Three members of the TA team assigned to the latter resigned and the fourth was fired by SODESF); this has left USAID/S totally without information on the project's impact. The project is producing tangible benefits and the opportunities it provides to test the stratification scheme for livestock production and to demonstrate resource management techniques warrant its extension in the long-term interests of the Sahel - provided there is immediate action to activate the range management and research and monitoring components.  Such action, in turn, is feasible only if SODESP changes its priorities in the project, which differ substantially from A.I.D.'s, or responsibility for the two components is transferred to another host government entity.","Attached to PD-AAN-259","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Animal husbandry|Livestock|Herders|Range management|Water supply|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Senegal","","","","","","English","","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation|Social science evaluation","","Roush, James L.|Rasmussen, Leroy|et al.","Livestock","Dec 1982","","","","Evaluation report : SODESP livestock project","","XD-AAN-259-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc5ODky","Senegal","6850224"
"Evaluates project to expand the small farmer credit program and strengthen the administrative capacity of La Merced (LM), Bolivia's largest agricultural co-op.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/79-1/82 and is based on document review, visits to LM, and a survey of participating farmers. Results of the project - extended to 6/83 to allow use of unspent funds for an experimental savings mobilization program - were mixed. While the targets for increasing LM's rural loan portfolio, average small farmer loan value, and rural savings were far surpassed, real increases were nil due to drastic currency devaluations and high inflation.  Also as a result of the latter, only one of three planned supply stores was successfully operated, and barely one borrower in 10 was able to buy improved farm inputs.  LM's loan delinquency rate was reduced from 70% to 7% and medium-term loans limited to 25% of LM's total portfolio, but borrowers complained about overly stringent co-signer requirements and small loan amounts.  Only 710 new LM members were recruited, against a target of 1,066.  Training and TA were provided to only one in four borrowers and were excessively narrow in scope and only 109 of 200 planned farmer training meetings were held, the majority of them in three communities; a farmer training plan is needed and the training of farmers to train other farmers should be considered.  Despite these shortfalls, farmers reported that access to credit led to increases in farm income (used, inter alia, to buy food and to finance education), and investments in productive capital, and employment. Within LM, a departmental organization scheme was implemented; administrative, accounting, and personnel manuals were prepared; and new credit regulations and loan documentation forms and periodic reporting and data collection systems established. Training was provided to LM's Credit Program staff and to members of a Central Credit Committee established during the project. To facilitate future evaluation of the project's impact, it is recommended that borrowers be required to record production costs, labor and input use, yields, and net income of each crop enterprise financed. Included in the report is an evaluation of the Development Associates, Inc. (DAI) system for evaluating co-ops.","Attached to PD-AAN-261","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Credit cooperatives|Agricultural credit|Institution building|Small farms|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data plus","Bolivia","","","001046 - Rural Development Services","","008515 - USAID.

"Presents final AID-WHO/AFRO evaluation of a project (due to end 12/82) to strengthen rural health delivery in 20 Central and West African countries.  Evaluation covers the period 1981-4/82 and is based on document review, visits to 11 countries, and interviews with donor, host government, project, and health service personnel, and with village health committees. Most goals of the project's four components were met.  Regional and national capacities for public health planning/management were bolstered by 21 well-received workshops or short-term courses (of which the project initiated 6 and assisted 15) given to 87 top and mid-level officials and supervisors at centers in Senegal, Nigeria, and Togo. WHO/AFRO also began a plan for a regional network of 11 national institutions which could further the work of the project; the group's secretariat will need much support to make this plan a reality. To strengthen national and regional capacities to train health workers, the project funded:  2 years of graduate work for 9 nurses in America; 3 nursing workshops in English for 42 participants and focusing on primary health care (PHC); and long- and short-term training at regional training centers in Senegal, Cameroon, and Liberia and at WHO centers in Nigeria and Togo, where efforts proved particularly beneficial. To strengthen communicable disease control (CDC), demonstration and training areas (DTA's) were set up in Cameroon, Ivory Coast, and Gambia and three full-time epidemiologists were stationed in regional organizations.  Geographic coverage in the DTA's has been achieved and immunization of target-age children against major diseases to a great extent accomplished, while efforts are being made to improve the program to immunize pregnant women against tetanus.  All three countries also began moving towards national expanded programs of immunization (EPI). This component also conducted 9 workshops for 202 participants on EPI management.  Negatively, the goal of training 6 CDC advisors was only partially met; efforts in disease surveillance and demographic data collection were limited; and little was done to establish national health planning information systems. Finally, the project assisted 3 workshops on PHC applied research and 2 on practical PHC organization for a total of 55 participants; it also funded a study of immunization in the Ivory Coast. In-country follow-up in the above areas is recommended.","French ed.: PD-ABA-882","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/afr-C-1414|PASA HZ/AR-0398-6-78","","4/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Rural areas|Health delivery|Health care administration|Health professional education|Primary health care|Immunizations|Communicable diseases|Maternal child health care|Institution building","Central Africa|West Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN320.pdf","4,795 KB","000026 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to support the use and manufacture of small-scale agricultural machinery in Indonesia, Thailand, India, and the Philippines.  Special evaluation covers the period 1979-11/81 and is based on site visits and interviews with International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) staff. The project is going well in Indonesia, poorly in Thailand, beginning well in the Philippines, and about to begin in India after three long years of discussion.  Project strengths are its purpose, which is attractive to LDC's; its client and results-oriented design; and IRRI's fine reputation, which promotes acceptance of the project and attracts capable staff. IRRI has been weak however, in formulating country strategies and work plans in conjunction with A.I.D. and counterpart personnel, and IRRI's strong capability to test new ideas in agricultural equipment has not been fully used due to poor communication with field staff, unclear research priorities, and lack of social analysis, which has left the project with a narrow engineering focus and little ability to identify farmer needs. In Indonesia, excellent progress has been made in equipment extension and in developing small equipment fabricators in the target province of West Sumatra.  Since 1979, 5 fabricators have built and sold 100 threshers, 2 others have begun building threshers, and a dealer has sold 50 threshers built elsewhere in Indonesia.  Progress was also made at the policy and institutional levels (e.g., a government plan to import Japanese tractors was cancelled).  The only problem is a tendency toward dispersion of effort beyond the limited available means; concentration on a few key targets is essential. In Thailand, extension has not been successful, despite a few useful accomplishments, and should be replanned.  Neither farmers not fabricators have accepted IRRI equipment designs, and IRRI's expertise in social, policy, and institutional analysis has not been used.  Worse, IRRI appears content to let this ineffective program run on indefinitely.  If the program is not substantially improved, it should be ended. An impressive start has been made in the Philippines during the 6 months the new outreach officer has been in the country, and greater access to policy issues than in the other countries is likely there.","Evaluation period: 1979-1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Axial blow threshers|Rice|Crop production equipment|Agricultural equipment|Agribusiness","India|Indonesia|Philippines|Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDCAF858.pdf","569 KB","000044 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase the availability of fertilizer in Bangladesh.  Special evaluation covers the period 1978-82; no methodology is noted. Under the project, 271,100 tons of fertilizer have been imported and 26 warehouses, with a combined capacity of 162,000 tons, are being constructed, roughly on schedule.  In addition, the New Marketing System (NMS) for fertilizer distribution through private firms has been introduced, leading to the closure of about half of the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation's (BADC) local sales centers. Fertilizer price decontrol was introduced in one of four divisions (Chittagong). Under the NMS, dealer training has begun, but dealer associations have not yet been formed, the dealers' network has not distributed information on fertilizer application to small farmers, dealer credit is not yet available, and wholesale distribution has only just begun.  The BADC has not yet implemented planned staffing and organizational changes to complement the NMS. Since 1980, fertilizer prices have increased about 40% due to an effort to reduce subsidy costs.  This price increase, along with the fact that a number of important project components have only recently been introduced, makes definitive judgment on project success impossible at this time.  Yet, the project has demonstrated both the success of Bangladesh's public sector in fertilizer production and distribution and the potential of the private sector in fertilizer retailing.  Key recommendations are to gradually increase private sector involvement in fertilizer distribution and to monitor the effects of the NMS carefully, making better use of available data while continuing to collect new data.  Finally, a 1979-80 study indicated that small farmers used more fertilizer per acre and obtained higher outputs per unit of fertilizer than did large farmers.","Evaluation period: 1978-1982","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Fertilizer distribution|Fertilizers|Agribusiness|Limited data","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDCAE550.pdf","129 KB","008511 - USAID.

"Evaluates integrated rural development project in Upper Volta. Special evaluation covers the period 9/78-7/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with Government of Upper Volta (GOUV) and Africare personnel and with beneficiaries. Despite a faulty project design, severe implementation delays, and limited participation by GOUV agencies, some activities (e.g., the livestock component) are - thanks to a concerted effort by Africare - working well, while others show progress. Village development committees have been formed in 45 villages; animateurs/animatrices have been posted to 12 ""Type I"" villages, but their effectiveness is limited by fuel shortages and a heavy taskload (e.g., organizing agricultural projects and pre-coops, literacy and health training).  Twelve village self-help projects have been completed, 16 are underway, and all 12 Type I villages have a viable producer association. Although the health component is riddled with serious management flaws, some progress has been made:  22 village health teams trained and supplied with medical kits; a dispensary built; and 3 health posts and the Seguenega health center renovated.  All sites lack refrigerators, however, posts are deficient in potable water and supplies, and the central pharmacy is badly disorganized. Lack of technical expertise has hindered educational efforts. Adult literacy centers (22) have opened, but both villager interest and quality of instruction vary widely.  Young farmer (YF) training, while successful in Goubre, is flawed overall due to students' low ages (11-14 years); 6 YF training centers and 5 pre-coops are operational, but no YF projects are yet underway. Extensionists, villagers, and farmers have received training in crop/animal production.  Vegetable cropping has had some success, rice very little.  Livestock outputs include:  distribution of good breeding-stock rams and roosters; a poultry center; 5 demonstration flocks; veterinary services; and a sheep fattening program. Other outputs include:  11 revolving credit funds established (loan recovery averages 91%); 70 km of roads upgraded; 67 ha reforested; 38 wells; and a nursery distributing 17,000-20,000 seedlings a year. Despite an operational project information system, little has been done to strengthen the management capacity of the Yatenga Regional Development Organization (ORD).  Placement of the project operations center at ORD's Ouahigouya Office rather than onsite in Seguenega has reduced ORD participation and weakened project management. Numerous detailed recommendations are made, key among them to: consolidate all training/extension functions at 6 central sites; relocate key staff to Seguenaga; and provide more (and more effective) management personnel.","Work order 8","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-1138-00","","7/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Community self help|Integrated rural development|Animal husbandry|Crop production|Health delivery|Literacy instruction|Beneficiary interviews","Burkina Faso","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN515.pdf","2,085 KB","003002 - Ronco Consulting Corp.","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","Popper, Roger|Harmon, David P., JR.|et al.","Rural areas / rural development","Jul 1982","","","","Mid-project evaluation : Seguenega integrated rural development project","","PD-AAN-515","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTgwNTIz","Burkina Faso","6860231"
"Evaluates P.L. 480 Title I-funded agricultural development activities in Tunisia.  Special evaluation covers the period 1981-3/82 and is based primarily on document review. Progress is being made in most areas.  Fertilizer supplies have increased in magnitude and remained of a high quality.  Use of both ammonium nitrate (AN) and phosphate fertilizers has grown steadily.  AN offtake increased by 22% during 1981-82 (to some 100,000 MT) compared to 1980-81, while phosphate use increased by 10%.  All this occurred in spite of serious drought in the country's central and southern regions and a poor start during the rainy season. There has been increasing high-level political sensitization to the need to expand fertilizer use; an interministerial group has met frequently to deal with problems in this area.  Other actions to improve distribution and consumption have included:  (1) a special distribution study, recommending that private retailer profit margins be doubled; (2) a decision to maintain a strategic reserve of 20,000 MT of AN; (3) plans to construct 9 new regional fertilizer depots (80,000 MT capacity) and 41 new wholesale/retail facilities; and (4) expansion of the credit system to give small farmers better access and include farmers without land. A soil testing and tissue analysis laboratory has been established at Nabeul and six similar facilities are planned (as well as two others funded separately by A.I.D.); careful review will be needed to ensure that these laboratories can be properly staffed and managed.  In other areas:  studies of low-cost fertilizers and of constraints on small farmers have been planned; 60 new extension offices will be opened, 200 extensionists trained, and research-extension linkages improved; measures will be taken to expand availability of improved seeds and herbicides; and the Government of Tunisia has taken several actions to selectively reduce subsidies. Annexes include recommendations for specific agricultural development activities and for the self-help terms of the 1982 P.L. 480 agreement; implementation schedules for the period 3/82-4/83; and comparative analyses of fertilizer costs.","Work order 10","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-1138-00","","3/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Fertilizer distribution|Fertilizers|Agricultural development|Food for Peace Title I|Limited data","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN516.pdf","814 KB","003002 - Ronco Consulting Corp.","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team","","","","Mar 1982","","","","Tunisia : review of the PL-480 supported development program","","PD-AAN-516","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTgwNTI1","Tunisia","664PL01"
"Evaluates project to conduct a soil survey and develop and implement a land classification scheme in Yemen.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/78-8/82 and is based on document review, discussions with USAID/Y, Government of the Yemen Arab Republic (YARG), and contractor personnel, and site visits. While soil survey personnel were not in place until 3/81, two and a half years after the project paper was signed, project objectives will be achieved by project end.  Survey activities have produced excellent soil descriptions, and work on a general soil map and a land use map is on schedule and meets contract requirements.  Soil analysis by the YARG soil laboratory has been effective and efficient; however, two integral personnel will leave the laboratory in 9/82.  Innovative procedures used in land classification resulted in high accuracy at a low cost; soil survey activities were also cost-effective.  A comparison of land use in 1972 to current land use could not be completed due to lack of baseline data; difficulties encountered in utilizing earlier data demonstrate the need for a National Soil Survey and Land Classification Office.  Two YARG soil scientists received training in English, soil mapping, and satellite image interpretation; however, both scientists plan to leave their positions soon.  Implementation was hampered somewhat by the lack of cooperation between the YARG Agronomy Department and the Resource Information Laboratory, the contractor's difficulties in handling logistics, and internal contractor conflicts. Because soil and land use maps being developed are not detailed enough to serve as a basis for agricultural decisionmaking, a follow-on project, to include larger scale (preferably 1:100,000) maps and in-country training in agricultural planning for YARG officials, is recommended.  However, the follow-on project should not begin until: the present soil survey is completed; the general soil map is revised to correct mistakes in subgroup units or soil associations and to base soil groupings on soil characteristics; the soil laboratory is adequately staffed; and field equipment needs are determined.  It is also recommended that steps be taken to minimize start-up delays and that the contractor not be considered for the follow-on project until its internal problems are solved.","Work order 9","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-1138-00","","8/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Geological surveys|Land surveys|Maps|Soil surveys","Yemen","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN517.pdf","950 KB","003002 - Ronco Consulting Corp.","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Evaluation team","","Caroll, Paul H.|Carter, Oliver|Plath, C.

"Evaluates project to develop Liberia's institutional capability for exploiting its mineral resources.  Ex post impact evaluation covers the period 5/62-7/72 and is based on document review and a survey of Liberians who worked on the project or used its products. The key achievement of this generally successful project was the transfer of U.S. technology to Liberia, resulting in a systematic determination of the location, characteristics, and extent of Liberia's natural resources.  The project also produced good base maps and aerial photographs and geophysical data which have been useful in public and private exploitation programs.  Especially significant were development of standardized documentation for presenting field data; a U.S.-Liberian program to determine the geochronology and correlation of rock units; and establishment of a professional Geological, Mining, and Metallurgical Society, which has, however, generally been inactive since the project's end. The project's main organizational achievement was the structuring of the Liberian Geological Survey (LGS) after the pattern of the U.S. Geological Survey, complete with all laboratory and technical apparatus. This led to the restructuring of several other existing Liberian services after the U.S. pattern. Socially, the project's main impact was the overseas geology training provided to 14 Liberians, ranging from short courses to B.S. programs; two others received M.S. degrees.  The project also promoted awareness of potential careers in mineral science among high school and college students and exchanges between U.S. and Liberian professionals. Negatively, training should have been scheduled so as to allow returning trainees time to provide input to the project and administrators should have been trained to allow geologists to concentrate on their areas of expertise.  Also, project objectives were too ambitious, given the limited implementation time and the paucity of accessible roads, TA, base maps, etc., and more emphasis should have been placed on institutionalizing systems (the project design's failure to foresee the slower-paced, Third World approach was detrimental in this regard).  Finally, TA should have been phased out slowly to ensure the continuation of project activities.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Geological surveys|Geological maps|Mineral resources|Technology transfer|Institution building|Participants","Liberia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN547.pdf","877 KB","003469 - Geoservices, Inc.","","008570 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to institutionalize a capacity in the Government of Liberia (GOL) to develop and administer an improved civil service.  Ex post impact evaluation covers the period 6/74-4/79 and is based on document review and interviews with GOL officials. Project targets were partially met.  Most significantly, the newly created Civil Service Agency (CSA) undertook personnel policies based on merit and fair play rather than on patronage. A position classification plan covering 139 separate classes of employment and 18,000 (of 20,000 possible) positions was established and a personnel testing system was made operational. Fifty-seven separate examinations were created and 12,000 persons tested during the life of the project.  Other achievements were to:  adopt an integrated salary schedule; approve a salary administration plan; require all GOL agencies to use the salary schedule in their budget presentations; develop a salary-setting system; create a servicewide roster and a personnel transaction system; develop personnel manuals covering all CSA functions; and institute a seven-man board of appeals.  Training was provided to GOL personnel in administrative, fiscal/professional, clerical, and general functions, and 23 senior CSA officials received Master's degree training in the United States in Public Administration. However, USAID/L failed to provide logistical support to the contract team and a personality conflict developed between the Chief-of-Party and the CSA's Director General.  In addition, the CSA staff was depleted through attrition.  The most serious problem was posed by GOL ministries and agencies which, sensing a threat, refused to cooperate with CSA or supply personnel data to it and bypassed the CSA in recruiting and promoting their staff. Many ministry and agency heads felt that the CSA's Director General had accumulated too much personal power.  As a consequence, many of those interviewed felt that the CSA had not significantly aided civil service reform. The project's short-term approach to bolster existing public institutions should have been applied to the Institute of Public Administration project.  While much was accomplished by the project, it occurred with such haste as to create counterproductive effects.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Civil service reform|Institution building|Management operations|Personnel management|Job classification|Personnel records|Reporting systems|Personnel testing|Limited data plus","Liberia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN548.pdf","750 KB","008570 - USAID.

"Evaluates project (conducted 1961-68) to help the Government of Liberia (GOL) to carry out administrative reorganization and management improvements.  Ex post impact evaluation is based in part on interviews with key informants. Although not all project-wrought reforms were institutionalized by the GOL, the project did effect a major shift in Liberia's governmental functioning - toward economy, simplicity, and efficiency.  The establishment of a Special Commission on Government Operations (SCOGO) resulted in a comphrehensive inquiry into the functioning of the Executive Branch and its personnel, and led in turn toward legislative acts reorganizing and streamlining 19 executive departments.  Major improvements were achieved in fiscal management, administrative procedures, tax collection, and personnel management.  Fiscal benefits resulted from cost savings, increased productivity of personnel, and increased revenue.  Also, the project provided training to numerous Liberians who have since occupied important GOL offices, it enhanced social services and their accessibility, and it gave impetus to a long list of subsequent technology transfer projects. The dramatic change in Liberia's political philosophy was strengthened by President Tubman's interest in all aspects of governmental organization and management.  Unfortunately however, many of the principles enunciated by SCOGO were ignored by subsequent GOL administrations, even by former SCOGO members who later rose to high government offices.  Project reforms - during implementation stages and later - were hampered by bureaucratic resistance to change, by a lack of continous broad-based political support, and to a lesser degree, by SCOGO's overinvolvement with techncial and operational concerns. Lessons learned were:  the project had too many objectives for its planned length (2 years); its objectives were more regulatory than developmental; little consideration was given to the civil service's absorptive capacity; no attempt was made to put forward an integrated performance improvement plan; preoccupation with day-to-day problems affected implementation of key innovations; and too little attention was given to the psychocultural needs of a tradition-oriented civil service.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Government reform|Management development|Departmental reorganization","Liberia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN550.pdf","853 KB","008570 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to create a consolidated school system in Monrovia, Liberia.  Ex post impact assessment covers the period 1962-72 and is based on document review and interviews with Government of Liberia (GOL) and other project personnel and participants. Project targets were partially met.  Two new elementary schools were constructed (vs. a target of 11) and a junior and a junior/senior high school were built (vs. a target of 2 junior high schools).  In addition, a central office building and a warehouse and maintenance building were erected to accomodate the school system's administrative unit.  An inservice training program was inaugurated to develop better teaching methods, especially in mathematics and science; vocational training was provided to students in various skills; and Master's degree training was offered to 80 Liberians in elementary and secondary school teaching and supervision.  Curriculum improvement activities were also carried out. Improved administrative policies and practices were introduced regarding personnel, maintenance and custodial services, and student personnel services.  The project's policy, organizational, and socioeconomic impact and its impact on women, were all positive. However, the project failed to achieve a principal objective - the administrative decentralization of effective school supervision and control - an idea imposed on the GOL by USAID/L. Further, the impact of the project council was limited because the politicians dominating it had little interest in the project. Also, the vocational education program was misconceived from the beginning, and the project failed to make a major economic impact, largely because money spent was on noncapital outlays. Lessons learned are that:  project objectives were unclear; specific targets were too ambitious; the pre-existing sociopolitical environment was not sufficiently considered; long-term operational costs were not given sufficient attention; the schools built were too modern and expensive; institution building took longer than anticipated; and the GOL was not adequately involved in project design.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Primary education|Secondary education|On the job training|Teacher training|Educational administration|Curriculum design|Decentralization|Educational facilities|Building construction","Liberia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN551.pdf","1,226 KB","003470 - Subah Belleh","","008570 - USAID.

"Evaluates OPG to the Overseas Educational Fund (OEF) to strengthen the capacity of the Moroccan Women's Union (UFM) to upgrade low-income Moroccan women's earning capacity.  Mid-term special evaluation covers the period 11/81-10/82 and is based on document review and interviews with project personnel and beneficiaries. Substantial progress has been made in the pilot income-generating project in such areas as nonformal education, literacy and macrame training, preparing doll and honey market studies, technical training for doll manufacturing, trial marketing of the dolls, initiating procedures to form an official doll cooperative, and designing recordkeeping systems.  The doll cooperative has been profitable and has raised the self-confidence of the 38 women involved both as individuals and as a group. On the other hand, there has been little success in strengthening UFM capabilities to plan, implement, and evaluate programs for low-income women.  The major activity geared to this goal - planning and holding workshops to familiarize UMF chapter members with the pilot project - has yet to take place.  There are serious communication problems between the OEF coordinators and the two UFM national committee advisors, resulting in large discrepancies in the expectations that the two organizations have for the project. Until it is decided whether the project will be extended, no new activities (i.e., apiculture) should be undertaken. Recommendations for the time remaining are to:  determine the economic feasibility of doll making and consolidate membership and financial and organizational management of the doll cooperative; and implement organizational skills training.  If a project extension is granted, the new workplan should be more realistic, beekeeping should be the main activity, and UMF philosophy should shift its emphasis from social welfare to self help. Lessons learned (added by USAID/M) are that counterparts to contractors must have skills equal to the job; contractors must be familiar with the local situation before beginning a project; and a too-ambitious work plan can lead a contractor to work alone instead of with counterparts.","Evaluation period: Nov 1981-Oct 1982","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Associations|Private voluntary organizations|Education|Cooperatives|Business enterprises|Small scale enterprises|Institution building|Artisans|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data plus","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN626.pdf","1,148 KB","000921 - League of Women Voters.

"Provides final report (9/79-4/82) on a project, implemented by the League of Women Voters' Overseas Education Fund (OEF), to strengthen the institutional capability of the Zambia Council for Social Development (ZCSD) and its member groups to plan, evaluate, and implement women in development projects. The project, although too ambitious and hampered by erratic implementation, made several significant contributions.  OEF advisors strengthened ZCSD capabilities in project evaluation and design, and helped ZCSD to carry out an FAO-funded survey of 60 organizations and programs related to family life and to clarify the role of women in member organization activities.  In addition, a needs assessment of 20 nongovernmental organizations was conducted and major assistance was provided to several of these. Further progress toward project objectives was precluded, however, by the erratic nature of backstopping from OEF's home office (due to high turnover and consequent lack of experienced staff) and by misunderstandings between OEF and A.I.D. and between OEF and ZCSD; the latter were a major impediment during the early stages of implementation.  Also, one of the two OEF onsite advisors left the project early and was not replaced and USAID/Z was not adequately staffed to support activities which were not specified in its country development strategy statement. Had the project been more attuned to USAID/Z's goals and strategies and had more attention been given to its shortcomings early on, the project may well have been continued. Lessons learned are that:  implementing agencies, host countries, and A.I.D. must share a clear understanding of project objectives and activities; adequate home office backstopping is crucial; and USAID's must be adequately staffed to provide needed project support.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AFR-G-1578","","11/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Development project design|Development project implementation|Development project evaluation|Women in development|Private voluntary organizations|Institution building|Limited data","Zambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN738.pdf","79 KB","008627 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to continue to develop peat as an energy resource in Burundi, to conserve forest reserves, and to strengthen the institutional capacity of the National Office for Peat (ONATOUR). Special mid-term evaluation covers the period 8/80-11/82 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with project personnel. The availability and acceptability of peat as an energy resource have significantly increased during the past 2 years.  ONATOUR's sales have grown from 3,534 tons in 1980 to 6,435 tons in 1981; 25,000 tons of sales are predicted for 1985.  However, the project's target beneficiaries, urban charcoal users, are still only vaguely familiar with peat and cannot buy it in retail markets.  Nor has the project yet had much effect on preserving forest resources; 1981-82 sales represented the wood equivalent of clean-cutting 422 ha or cropping 2,340 ha. Institutionally, ONATOUR has made excellent progress.  The organization is well-staffed with qualified professionals in its administrative, financial, production, and marketing services. ONATOUR should realize a net profit on operations in 1983 and a cumulative net profit in 1984. Although ONATOUR launched a limited domestic peat marketing campaign in 1982, much stronger efforts in this area are needed. To create a marketing demand for ONATOUR's increasing supply of peat, a suitable stove must be designed for urban users and made commercially available, the quality of peat sold in the market must be comparable to that of charcoal, and there must be a retail price structure to ensure that peat is more economical than charcoal.  An aggressive marketing campaign will also accelerate the conservation of forest resources. Other recommendations are, inter alia, to reduce the project's peat production target (due to production constraints in the areas of technology, labor, logistics, and product quality, and the necessity not to outpace consumer demand); to strengthen ONATOUR capabilities in accounting, inventory storage and control, and coordination with other agencies; and to continue to encourage the evolution of ONATOUR from a parastatal organization to a private enterprise.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Energy farming|Institution building|Alternative energy resources|Peat","Burundi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN739.pdf","2,767 KB","008522 - USAID.

"Evaluates irrigation/integrated farming project in Senegal's Bakel region.  Special evaluation covers the period 3/80-11/81 and is based on document review, extensive site visits, and interviews with farmers, administrators, and project and other-donor personnel. The project has not adhered to its design or the recommendations of the 1980 review team, and is not functioning as an integrated farming project, as no attempt has been made to introduce crops other than rice. Nonetheless, it can be viewed as a successful pilot effort which has exposed irrigation problems common to the Senegal River Valley and proven that high-yielding rice varieties can be grown there at close to their biological potential. Farmers in the area are clearly educable - they rotate water efficiently, use short-season rice in dry fields, show interest in other crops, and in some cases adjust fertilizer use to soil conditions. However, they need more support:  agents of the Senegalese Societe pour l'Amerragement et Exploitation du Delta (SAED) often lack experience in the techniques they are teaching; crop protection has been ignored; and due to lack of soil surveys, some farmers are growing flooded rice in unsuitable areas.  Also, low nationally regulated rice prices may result in misallocation of farm resources; already farm federations are accumulating surpluses rather than sell at SAED prices.  The project has been slow in collecting yield and production cost data. Poor pumping plant maintenance, aggravated by problems with floats and fueling systems, is causing expensive, untimely breakdowns and drastically curtailed equipment life - problems which alone are sufficient to destroy the project's economic viability. Also, many pumping plants and penstocks which deliver water to the canals are poorly designed, the relationship between pump size and system size has been arbitrarily set, and farmers have not been helped to build water courses or level land.  The project's solar thermal pump system is too materials-intensive (and maintenance-intensive) to be anywhere near cost-effective, and should be abandoned. USAID/S lacks the capacity to manage complex projects such as this; an effective counterpart relationship has not been established; and no SAED offical participated in this evaluation (unusual in a joint project), nor were project personnel encouraged to cooperate with, or to learn from, the evaluation.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSAN-C-0058","","1/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated agricultural production|Irrigation|Agricultural water management|Farm management|Water supply engineering|Water supply structure maintenance|River basins|Rice|Beneficiary interviews","Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAP147.pdf","6,299 KB","001249 - Utah State University.

"Evaluates project to assist the Government of Sri Lanka (GSL) to improve the design and operation of its irrigation and water management systems.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/79-7/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with GSL officials and project participants. While the project has had some successes it has largely failed to meet its implementation schedule.  A master plan has been developed for the Gal Oya irrigation system which fits the requirements specified in the consultant's work plan, although it lacks the comprehensiveness needed for the task at hand. Rehabilitation design and construction plans have been prepared but are believed overly optimistic and inappropriate and this component has fallen far behind schedule. Project training programs have failed to meet implementation deadlines in both major components, facility upgrading and curriculum development, and the training of farm leaders and village-level workers has been delayed. Implementation delays have largely resulted from a lack of adequate personnel in the GSL Irrigation Department and racial problems which beset the island in the recent past.  Other contributing factors have been the lack of communication and coordination between major participants and a lack of GSL funds. By contrast, the overseas training of Institutional Organizers (IO's) and personnel has proceeded smoothly.  The IO program has been largely accepted by cultivators and many farmers have joined the turn-out groups formed with IO assistance.  Another component, research and data collection/analysis, has been successfully carried out by the Agrarian Research and Training Institute (ARTI) and Cornell University.  Progress has been made in putting the contractor on-board and commodities have been received on schedule. Recommendations include a 2-year project extension to 4/31/86.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSAN-C-0058","","7/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigation|Water management|Management training|Data collection|Water supply structures|Water supply structure maintenance|Planning|Beneficiary interviews","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAP148.pdf","945 KB","001249 - Utah State University.

"Evaluates project to establish a potable water supply system and a health education program in rural southwestern Upper Volta. Mid-term special evaluation covers the period 7/79-7/82 and is based on site visits and interviews with project personnel and beneficiaries. After a slow start due to the delayed arrival of commodities, equipment, and contract personnel, the project has made good progress - especially in well construction.  As of 4/82, 153 new wells have been built (73 drilled/sealed; 80 hand-dug/capped), 18 others deepened, and 60 Moyno hand pumps installed; of 620 targeted wells, 500 should be completed by the project's end. Construction of the project headquarters building, garage, and warehouse is virtually complete. While progress is also being made in health education, efforts here have been hindered by organizational difficulties, e.g., a meager budget, too few personnel, and only minimal participation by the National Center for Health Education.  Training of health extension agents (AI's) - who, in turn, are to train/supervise 550 village health workers (ASV's) in health education, latrine construction, and primary care  - is far behind schedule.  The first 22 AI's will not be ready for the field until 1/83; 30 more will graduate each year (vs. an overall target of 110 AI's).  In their absence, 107 ASV's have been trained by practical nurses and project health educators.  Unfortunately, villagers are more interested in ASV's curative (i.e., drug dispensing) than their preventative duties. Most seriously, cooperation between the two project components has been weak.  Wells were constructed prior to village health education and situated without regard to health factors.  As a result, many villagers are still unaware of the health value of improved water, some wells are sited in unsanitary areas, and it is difficult to incorporate water-related health activities into ASV training and duties.  Because villagers were not involved in well superstructure construction or pump installation and no village well/pump maintenance system has yet been devised, wells/pumps are neither maintained nor the areas kept sanitary. Numerous recommendations include:  a 1-year, no-cost extension; and, with a modified health component, a possible Phase II.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-2085-00","","8/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Potable water|Water supply|Sanitation education|Water sanitation|Dug wells|Drilled wells|Rural areas|Health education|Beneficiary interviews","Burkina Faso","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN762.pdf","3,094 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates project to construct three rural roads in eastern Upper Volta.  Final external evaluation covers the period 1977-3/82 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with A.I.D. and Government of Upper Volta (GOUV) personnel and other concerned officials. Of three roads (159 km) to be completed by 9/79, only one was built (39 km), begun in 3/80 and now 95% complete at tripled cost per km ($17,300 planned vs. $53,100 actual).  Principal causes of the cost and time overruns were a failure to secure competent TA; poor management; slow, inefficient procurement; poor maintenance and use of equipment; questionable construction quality; upgraded design without corresponding cost estimate changes; and the need to rebuild drainage structures and roadway after new road sections had washed out due to inadequate and improperly located drains.  Nevertheless, despite its excessive cost and questionable quality, the road has markedly improved area residents' quality of life through increased supplies and regular truck delivery. The project design miscalculated the amount of work needed, earthwork production rates, the appropriate equipment mix, and the time frame for implementation.  Construction funds were underprescribed.  Two options for a follow-on project are presented: (1) construction by local private contractors, with Travaux Publics (TP) providing technical and engineering supervision and USAID/W providing short-term TA (road design engineer, construction superintendent, mechanic advisor); (2) construction by a brigade under TP supervision with management control by a U.S. firm able to train Voltaic counterparts (force account option).  The former approach has worked successfully in Upper Volta for other donors. Modifications proposed for better project management include: inventory/control systems for fuel, construction materials, and spare parts; recruitment of local personnel for road crews; and improved facilities for equipment maintenance and spare parts storage.  USAID/W should provide more TA to help the GOUV to prepare plans, specifications, and schedules.  If the force account method is used, design, construction, and equipment advisors and a procurement/inventory specialist should be added. Stronger GOUV commitment to road maintenance is needed.","Attachment: XD-AAN-759-A (Volume II, annexes)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Road construction|Access roads|Rural areas","Burkina Faso","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN759.pdf","1,900 KB","008620 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to promote family planning (FP) and increase awareness of population problems in Ecuador.  Special evaluation, focusing on private sector subgrantees, covers the period 11/81-11/82 and is based on site visits, interviews, and document review. It appears that project targets will be met.  CEMOPLAF (the Medical Center for FP and Orientation) opened a clinic (3 are planned) in Guayaquil in 1/82.  While the clinic is below target for new acceptors, corrective steps have been taken and CEMOPLAF is expected to reach 1,180 new acceptors during 1982 (67% of target).  CEMOPLAF is above target in terms of women motivated in individual interviews, and has also developed educational materials and advertised clinic services on radio. A second clinic, in Esmeraldos, should open in 1/83. CEPAR (the Center for the Promotion of Responsible Parenthood) has surpassed its goals in virtually all areas.  A Documentation Center on Population and FP has been opened.  The center's collection exceeds targets, but public response has been disappointing.  CEPAR also surpassed targets in identifying leaders and mass media.  Training activities have been close to schedule; a training center was opened in 4/82, 30 potential FP instructors have been trained, a seminar was held for 25 social workers, and a course for physicians is planned.  Research and publications have been less successful - the one research study completed is not entirely satisfactory. Planned activities of the third subgrantee, APROFE (the Association for the Welfare of the Ecuadorean Family), have been postponed due to a perceived funding overlap.  The International Planned Parenthood Federation/Western Hemisphere (IPPF/WH) coordinating office was established in Quito early in l982.  IPPF performance has been high, but continued TA to subgrantees is needed. Major issues and problems have been:  an excess of funds due to devaluation of the sucre, causing a need to consider additional activities; subgrantee expenditures in excess of disbursements; difficulties in receiving approval for duty free import of equipment; need for additional supportive training and information efforts; and need to assure private agency leadership of future funding. Detailed recommendations are made for IPPF/WH and each subgrantee.","Attached to PD-AAN-805","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning education|Family planning promotion programs|Delivery systems|Beneficiary count","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAN805A.pdf","3,810 KB","","","008538 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to extend primary health care (PHC) services to five socially and culturally remote provinces in Ecuador. External final evaluation covers the period 10/78-11/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project, government, and A.I.D. personnel. The project, which was implemented with help from MAP (Medical Assistance Programs) International, by Vozandes Hospital of Quito (a part of World Radio Missionary Fellowship), demonstrated the feasibility of working with evangelical associations to initiate PHC programs.  With the help of over 130 community health workers (all of them, men, however) who were trained during the first 2.5 years and who have received extensive supervision by a superior cadre of health professionals, the project extended PHC services to at least 40,000 people in four provinces (the fifth was dropped due to lack of supervisory staff and initiation of a Ministry of Health (MOH) program in the area).  The amount of PHC delivered varied by province, and even in the areas served not all communities appear to have been accessible by car or aircraft.  Assessment of actual coverage and impact is difficult due to inadequate data collection, a serious deficiency. Nonetheless, project staff helped to install water pumps and participated in vaccination campaigns; latrines, previously almost nonexistent, are now found in every project area and sanitary practices and the conditions of dwelling units have improved.  Services were provided regardless of religious belief, but no effort was made to deal with traditional healers.  During its course, the project merged with an MOH program, which it has helped shape, and also markedly increased target populations' awareness of and access to government services, (e.g., help in installing sanitation facilities). Many features of this effort - the design of which, as in similar AID-funded PVO programs, appropriately encouraged flexibility - do not appear to be very costly, but replication would be very expensive.  This is especially because of the excessive dependence on expatriate professionals who work in special conditions and who receive considerable social and communications support that would be unavailable to government workers.","Attached to PD-AAN-813","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Primary health care|Private voluntary organizations|Paramedical education|Community health workers|Sanitation education|Beneficiary count|Limited data plus","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAN813A.pdf","1,790 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Social science evaluation|Onsite evaluation|Final EOPS","","Marname, Patrick H.","","Nov 1982","","","","Evaluation report : OPG 518-0002, rural community health project, Ecuador","","XD-AAN-813-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTgxMjA3","Ecuador","5180002"
"Presents final Mission report (9/28/80-9/28/82) on a project to assist the Honduran Ecological Association (AHE) to promote environmental education, conservation, and the rational use of natural resources and to create public awareness of the need for environmental protection. The project achieved its objectives.  Some 200 photographs of the environment were taken and exhibited at AHE headquarters; four slide programs utilizing over 1,000 slides were presented to public groups and institutions; three video tape programs were completed; and a 30-second TV spot was presented more than 30 times during prime time.  In addition, AHE printed and distributed 2,100 posters, pamphlet guides, and bumperstickers and 3,150 bulletins describing its goals and objectives (vs. targets of 2,000 and 3,500, respectively).  AHE met its objective of increasing its membership by 200 over the life of the grant and successfully raised some $1,000 in contributions. Any future A.I.D. project with AHE should support the services of a full-time director and secretary.  The importance of strong leadership and direction cannot be overemphasized; this project was almost brought to a halt by leadership problems and personality conflicts within AHE. AHE's Phase II OPG proposal has been well prepared and the Mission hopes that funding will be forthcoming.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Environmental education|Mass media|Educational materials|Audiovisual educational materials|Private voluntary organizations|Limited data","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN848.pdf","116 KB","008555 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the Government of Nepal (GON) Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Irrigation (MFAI) establish a labor intensive system, based on private growers, to produce and distribute major food crops and store/distribute all inputs used to produce the crops cheaply and effectively.  Special evaluation covers the period 12/79-10/82 and is based on site visits and interviews with MFAI, USAID/N, and other project personnel. Progress has been achieved, but implementation has fallen short of planned targets.  As a result, the project completion date has been extended by one year to 8/84.  GON red tape and ineffective coordination between implementing agencies have resulted in construction delays, slow personnel selection for training, and personnel shortages, and poor foundation seed production in targeted areas.  Of 16 mini-seed houses plannned for construction, 4 have been completed and 4 others are under construction. While 6 of a targeted 12 warehouses are currently underway, none has been completed.  Only 4 engineers and 9 overseers have been recruited to supervise the construction activity, an insufficient number to effectively monitor the work, thus contributing to delays in the final approval and turnover of completed structures.  A shortage of foundation seed continues to exist in Nepal and quantities of seed produced on GON farms have not reached planned targets.  Greater emphasis is now being placed on boosting seed production; seed marketing activities are soon to be initiated. Twenty baseline survey reports have been published and 13 others are underway; 25 operational plans and 2 socioeconomic surveys have been completed.  Social science research has been conducted in 2 communities, and a study of seed analysis/quality initiated. Agricultural credit has been supplied to farmers by 2 Nepalese financial institutions, although it has often been diffult for them to obtain.  Some 13 of a targeted 26 in-country training programs have been completed; but overseas training has suffered delays as a result of candidates who lack English language proficiency, a negative attitude on the part of the Government of India toward project activities, and problems in sending the students to study in Europe.  Recommendations are set forth.","Work order no. 6","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-1142-00","","10/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural production|Seed production|Varietal research|Participants|Agricultural credit","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN975.pdf","1,462 KB","000480 - Experience, Inc.","","008583 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the institutional and financial capability of the the Dominican Development Foundation (DDF) to extend production and marketing credit to small farmers.  Special evaluation, which focuses on TA provided the DDF by the Technical Services of the Caribbean (TSC), covers the period 9/79-8/82 and is based on document review and interviews with experts. TSC helped the DDF:  structure its new Financing Division; design a system of economic and financial programming; and evaluate its arts and crafts program and its development model.  Direct beneficiaries were the Controllers and the Office of Management of Social and Financial Services, especially in regard to group loan criteria, credit guides, project preparation, and loan analysis and decisionmaking.  TSC also produced documentation valuable for a DDT training program and improved/adapted certain forms, guides, and procedures (e.g., organizational chart).  The arts and crafts program, however, needs a fuller evaluation than TSC has time to provide.  Particularly needed is an indepth study of rural and social organization.  The DDT has already implemented 65-70% of TSC's recommendations, which still, however, need to organized into an integrated whole. Some problems remain.  The loan recovery rate, for example, is still low (70%), apparently as a result of the inadequate marketing of crops produced with DDT credit, lack of DDT follow-up (especially on technical productive aspects), and lack of internal controls in the groups receiving credit.  Although the groups have formed specialized teams to address these issues, they remain quite undeveloped; the marketing committees in particular lack negotiating power.  TSC's insistence on a Competitive Point of DOP 10,000 for an average group of 17 producers has led the DDT to grant requests beyond the administrative capacities of the groups.  The DDT clearly needs to determine the financial status of individuals in the groups more rigorously.  It also needs to develop an adequate information system; analyse the rationality of its investments and its economic, cultural, and social impacts; and determine whether it is principally a social or financial agency.  Editor's Note:  The document on which this abstract was based was either very badly translated from Spanish or was written by someone with inadequate knowledge of the English language.","Attached to PD-AAN-992","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Small farms|Farmers|Foundations|Development organizations|National level|Agricultural credit|Institution building","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAN992A.pdf","1,645 KB","003588 - Dominican Development Foundation Inc.|003589 - Center for Counseling, Evaluations and Studies","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Evaluation team|Onsite evaluation|Social science evaluation","","","","Jul 1982","","","","Evaluation report of the results of the technical assistance provided by the technical assistance services of the Caribbean to the Dominican Development Foundations, Inc.","","XD-AAN-992-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTgxNjIz","Dominican Republic","5170124"
"Evaluates project component to strengthen the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI).  Special evaluation covers the period 1981-11/82 and is based on site visits and interviews with Government of Bangladesh (GOB) and BRRI personnel. BRRI's staff development is progressing well.  Since 1981, using funding from a variety of donors, 16 BRRI scientists have begun M.S. programs, 2 have begun Ph.D.'s, and 34 have completed or are receiving short-term training, all at IRRI or the University of the Philippines at Los Banos.  BRRI staff are generally young, competent, and dedicated; return of the 43 BRRI scientists currently studying in the Philippines should alleviate BRRI's staffing constraints. Development of BRRI's national research station at Joydebpur is largely complete, with laboratories and experimental areas fully utilized and land development complete, although staff housing remains a problem.  While the regional substation at Comilla has produced a high grade of research and effective linkages with extension agents, other substations are in the early stage of development and troubled, due to their remoteness, by staff recruitment and transport problems.  Two planned substations have not been begun because of a ban on government acquisition of farmers' land and a temporary hiring freeze. Good progress is being made in research.  Two new rice varieties, BR10 and BR11, have produced high yields and are occupying more acreage each year.  New deepwater varieties are also being developed, but with no major breakthroughs on the horizon yet. More than 750 soil tests have been conducted on farmers' fields, confirming that 72% of fields are sulfur-deficient and more than half zinc-deficient.  Significant findings have also been made regarding cropping patterns, planting practices, tillage, weed control, and fertilizer use.  Work is also underway in such areas as agricultural economics, machinery design, pest management, and statistical sampling for yield estimation. BRRI provides two 4-month rice production courses annually for extensionists and its publication program has produced a wide range of materials in English and Bengali; printing facilities are being improved.  In contrast, the library has been unable to collect all the technical materials it needs.  Recommendations are made.","Project title: International agricultural research centers (IARCs)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Rice|Institution building|Participants|Agricultural education|Research organizations|On farm research|Farming systems research|Economic research|Engineering research|Soil research|Varietal research","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP004.pdf","5,505 KB","000672 - International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)|003593 - Bangladesh Rice Research Institute","","008511 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to equalize the Government of Pakistan's (GOP's) balance of payment deficits through the Agricultural Commodities and Equipment Program.  Special evaluation covers the period 3/82-12/82 and is based on document review, indepth interviews, and site visits. Implementation has progressed on schedule, conformed to the design plans, and achieved the main objective of the first nine months:  to provide balance of payments support.  The program should be continued. There have been no major problems in buying the fertilizer to boost agricultural production; only minor shipping-related problems have been encountered.  To expedite the procurement process, USAID/P has  acted as agent for the GOP.  In practice, though, the GOP retained approval rights at the most critical points of the procurement process.  Although considerable progress has been made in planning, developing, and executing policy studies, the usefulness of these studies was not assessed. Some warehouses have not adequately protected fertilizer.  AID's role in getting equipment from customs to the provinces has not been established.  Balance of payments were relieved when the fertilizer contracts were awarded.  A discrepancy exists between the evaluation plan and A.I.D.'s intention to measure impact of this particular program on agricultural productivity.  Almost all rupees from the first nine months of the project have been earned and negotiations for their use are underway. Recommendations include: USAID/P should urge talks between the Federal Directorate of Fertilizer Imports and AID's Office of Commodity Management to resolve shipping problems.  USAID/P should use caution when procuring equipment and should not take physical possession of any equipment.  The project amendment should address potential dangers when USAID/P acts as the procurement agent.  An experienced, full-time procurement specialist should be hired.  USAID/P should monitor warehouses that store fertilizer to ensure timely delivery.  Procedures to transfer equipment from customs to provinces should be instituted. Packages have the name of the province where they are being shipped. Agricultural performance should be further examined to ensure that expected changes are monitored.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural equipment|Agricultural products|Agricultural productivity|Balance of payments","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP011.pdf","1,676 KB","","","008588 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to assist the Instituto Marcelino to establish gynecological and family planning (FP) clinics in two areas outside Lima, Peru, and to organize a community-based distribution (CBD) programs.  Special evaluation covers the period 11/80-10/82; no methodology is specified. The project has encountered many problems:  difficulty in finding personnel, especially physicians and social workers, to collaborate; little knowledge of project methodology on the part of the coordinator and failure to request TA early on; the inefficient administrative structure of the Instituto; opposition by government officials, journalists, and community leaders in the two project areas (Arequipa and Chiclayo); and difficulties in clearing contraceptives and equipment through customs. The Arequipa clinic began operations in 4/81.  Although the number of consultations rose from 9 that month to 310 in 12/81 (25% for FP and the remainder gynecological), during 1982 there has been only a 4% increase - due perhaps to deficiencies in promotional activities and to the presence of competing FP programs.  CBD activities - which also decreased during 1982 - have had little success.  The program offers a limited choice (Noriday and condoms) and products are available free elsewhere. The CBD manager has a poor relationship with promoters, little empathy with clients, and has been unable to organize activities effectively.  Despite the deficiencies in Arequipa, a medical service and infrastructure have been established, the Instituto is well known, and there are some motivated individuals.  The potential to serve as a base for expanding services to rural areas is present. In Chiclayo, the clinic, which opened in 5/81, has had to move three times and has had trouble finding competent doctors. Demand for medical attention increased 208% in l982 and new users increased 71%; 52% of services in 1982 were for FP.  The CBD component in Chiclayo - despite well-motivated promoters and distributors, the Instituto's good standing in the area, and a variety of promotional efforts - has recorded only modest numbers of new users, with a drop in recent months.  However, the number of active users increases every month. Detailed recommendations are made.","Attached to PD-AAP-089","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning clinics|Community based delivery|Contraceptive distribution|Private organizations|Limited data plus","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP089A.pdf","906 KB","","","008591 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the capacity of the Government of Burundi's (GOB's) National Office for Peat (ONATOUR) to produce and market peat as an alternative energy source.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/80-8/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with USAID/B, ONATOUR, and other officials. Prospects for the project's future are good.  Peat production at the Ijenda, Kisozi, and Matana bogs has impressively increased from about 1,500 tons (1978) to 6,300 tons (l98l), mainly due to greater efficiency and manual productivity.  However, a 6-month AID/W waiver-approval delay resulted in the late (9/81) introduction of 3 semi-automatic peat macerators (SAM's), the failure to meet the 1981 production target of 12,500 tons, and postponement of the purchase of 17 additional SAM's; further, it appears the SAM may not be the best mechanization choice. ONATOUR has not yet tapped the targeted urban domestic market due to lack of a peat surplus and the delayed development of an appropriate cooking stove:  70% of sales are still to the Burundian army and 30% to religious missions, small businesses, and artisans.  Stove design and carbonization studies are underway; the latter may yield alternative domestic peat uses. Although ONATOUR is operating on a deficit basis, the GOB has made up the shortfalls on a timely basis and negotiated two substantial peat price raises to the army.  Also, the opening of a new access road and increased production levels should reduce average peat production costs.  ONATOUR has filled all of its senior positions with qualified, although inexperienced, personnel; its director is attending long-term training. Problems have included:  production inefficiencies (e.g., lack of an onsite system for weighing peat); TA recruitment delays and lack of role clarity; delayed office construction; and lack of transportation and high demonstration costs for ONATOUR's publicity efforts. The GRB has fulfilled the financial/administrative conditions precedent to additional disbursement (the construction conditions precedent remain).  Recommendations include to test three harvesting technologies in 1982 before procuring additional machinery.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Peat|Harvesting|Harvesting machines|Energy farming|Alternative energy resources|Energy resource development|Alternative energy technology","Burundi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP099.pdf","759 KB","","","008522 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to upgrade agricultural training in Sri Lanka. Special evaluation covers the period 1978-82 and is based on document review, site visits to experimental farms, and interviews with members of the Postgraduate Institute of Agriculture (PGIA) and the Faculty of Agriculture (FA) of the University of Peradeniya, and with participant trainees. Project performance has been satisfactory.  Indigenous agricultural education in Sri Lanka has been expanded, two new faculties of agriculture having been established.  The annual output of B.Sc.'s should exceed 180 by 1985-86 and the targeted 200 be achieved in 1987/88.  However, recent evidence of slackening demand for B.Sc's, however, although perhaps only temporary, makes imperative a comprehensive reassessment of present and future demands.  As for postgraduate training, demand in this area should be satisfied by the mid-1980's, even though PGIA remains the only Sri Lankan institution offering postgraduate agricultural training.  More than 20 subjects have been added to the FA undergraduate curriculum, and 15 new courses to the PGIA program.  The total PGIA/FA staff complement has risen from 39 to 74, and should reach 87 by project end (vs. 91 targeted). Participant training outputs are estimated at 36 Ph.D's and one M.S. (vs. 38 Ph.D.'s targeted), but it will be impossible to complete all Ph.D. training by the present PACD; extension of the PACD for training is recommended, along with funding of two additional M.S.'s.  Most participants will conduct dissertation research in Sri Lanka, further strengthening indigenous capacity. Satisfactory progress is being made in procurement of equipment and in construction; library acquisitions; the development of research programs, laboratories, and experimental farms; and technical assistance.  Although the development of outreach programs is behind schedule, end-of-project targets appear achievable. Major problems have been:  high inflation, causing reductions in some inputs; and an unrealistic and inflexible implementation plan, which has now been satisfactorily modified.  Sixty recommendations are made.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural education|Agricultural colleges|Teacher education|Faculty|Participants|Graduate education|Undergraduate education|Institution building|Beneficiary interviews","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP110.pdf","12,312 KB","003637 - University of Peradeniya.

"Evaluates project to upgrade the capacity of the Government of Nepal's (HMG's) Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) to conduct social science research and agricultural development planning.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/76-2/82 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with USAID/N, HMG, and other project personnel. Due in large part to the Agricultural Development Council's (the implementor) established organization in Asia and America, the project has successfully met its objectives and operated cost-effectively. Training provided to staff of the Agricultural Projects Service Center (APSC) and other MOA agencies has included:  Ph.D. training in the United States for 2 candidates (vs. 3 targeted) and Master's training in Asia and Australia for 33 (vs. 16) 20 of whom have returned to Nepal - 19 have rejoined their original agencies (many in jobs requiring research skills); and 101.5 person-months (vs. 60) of short-term training in and out of Nepal for 106 personnel (25% women).  The latter was most successful when focused on immediately useful skills.  Other project achievements have included:  sending 11 Nepalis to seminars/conferences outside Nepal; organizing 7 major seminars in Nepal (some linking senior planning officials with young trained social scientists to produce papers) and several 2-hour seminars given by visiting and local scholars; conducting 9 research studies in Nepal (research is already having a positive impact on planning); and publishing 35 high-quality research studies, seminar reports, and Master's thesis summaries.  The MOA has been provided with 10 person-years of TA, 2 mini-computers, and other equipment. However, no ongoing program of social science research has yet been implemented by the MOA within the APSC, due to a lack of funding from HMG.  Although scholarly, MOA research publications have lacked executive summaries and sections on policy implications.  Also, only 8 of the returning graduates have been given higher level jobs, 11 have been reinstated at the same level; there is concern that low pay and lack of advancement may lead to job dissatisfaction. Eight recommendations are given.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Social science education|Agricultural research|Agricultural planning|Agricultural policy|Beneficiary interviews","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP168.pdf","2,164 KB","","","008583 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the Sahel Institute (INSAH) of the Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel develop the capacity for demographic data collection, processing, analysis, and use.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/80-10/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with A.I.D., INSAH, and host country personnel. Despite delays due to computer difficulties and problems within collaborating institutions, the project has achieved most of its targets.

USED has:  initiated subprojects to analyze existing census/survey data in Senegal, Upper Volta, Mali, Gambia, Niger, Mauritania, and Cape Verde (although not in Chad); begun infant mortality studies in Senegal, Upper Volta, and Mali (developing valuable computerized data input procedures in the process) and 1 of 3 planned long-term development impact studies (on nomadic pastoralism in Senegal); earmarked funds for a health statistics project in Cape Verde; and undertaken a pilot migration study in Bamako, Mali, and an origin-destination migration study (i.e., from Senegal to Paris). As a result of USED training efforts:  12 statistical personnel from 6 Sahelian countries have completed the first year of a 3-year statistics course in Senegal; 2 Gambians are attending a 2-year statistics course in Nigeria, with a third attending a 3-year program; and 4 Malian and Senegalese students are set to begin U.S. graduate training.  In addition, 2 conferences and 1 (of a targeted 6) national population and development seminars have been conducted, the latter was held in Niger for 30 participants.  Inter-Sahelian assistance has included placing a Chadian demographer in Mauritania and a Malian in Niger. As the demographic holdings in INSAH's documentation center are meager and USED's data processing capabilities inadequate, it is recommended that these be upgraded.  Also, the project should be extended for 2 years and USED's focus shifted from grant-making to mainly providing regional TA.","Attached to PD-AAP-176","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Demographic data collection|Demographers|Research centers|Technical training|Statistical data|Statistical analysis","Sahel","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP176A.pdf","3,178 KB","003684 - Sahel Institute.

"Evaluates project to assist the Government of Cape Verde to establish a viable watershed management program, including a pilot agricultural extension service and to increase the amount of productive land available for agriculture.  Special evaluation covers the period to 12/15/82 and is based on site visits and interviews with project officials. The project is generally meeting its objectives, particularly with regard to its waterworks construction and employment components.  Some 424 (vs. a targeted 1500) planned check dams have been completed and the completion rate has been steadily increasing.  In addition, 82.5 km of contour walls have been built.  As a result, water supplies have shown signs of increase, run-off has been reduced, crop yields have increased, and new cropping practices have been put into effect by farmers.  As far as developing an employment program to carry out project construction, the goal of 3,000 persons hired has nearly been met, largely due to local decisionmaking and participation in the recruitment process. Research capabilities have been bolstered with the establishment of a Center for Agricultural Studies, which will furnish TA to the project and play a major role in training extensionists. The project's complexity has led to a less than optimal sequencing of its various components, with major emphasis placed on the construction and employment activities at the expense of other activities.  While the core of an experimental extension program has been put in place, this component has met with minimal success.  Difficulties in setting up a national extension program and bureaucratic obstacles have delayed implementation of the experimental program; a lack of trained full-time extensionists (two part-time extensionists and an extension coordinator are now on board) has contributed to its overall lack of progress. Further, lack of coordination and integration among project elements (no master plan has yet been developed) and a dearth of systematic methodology in data collection have hampered accomplishment of project objectives. Nineteen recommendations are included.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Watersheds|Water supply structures|Agricultural extension|Employment|Agricultural research","Cape Verde","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP206.pdf","3,787 KB","008525 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop statistics on socioeconomic progress for use in rural development planning in El Salvador.  Special evaluation covers the period 2/81-10/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and indepth interviews. Due to inadequate A.I.D. monitoring, the project, which is being implemented by a permanent secretariat of the Centro de Estudios Centroamericanos de Integracion Economica y Desarollo (SIECA/ECID), has moved into several areas outside its planned scope (e.g., development of a typology of possible government policy interventions), but has still not developed a final set of social progress indicators based on the smallest feasible number of variables - a fundamental project activity. Five basic categories have been defined, but the use of 157 variables makes the analysis highly redundant.  Curtailment of household surveys by the war - alternative data sources are recommended - does not explain this failure. Regarding recommendations made in the 2/81 evaluation, work has progressed on 3 of the 7 that concern income measure - correlating size of landholdings and cash income levels among rural families, classifying rural occupations, and (although much more streamlining is needed) correlating control variables. There has been no action to include an overage indicator for education, shorten the recall period on the health questionnaire (the war has curtailed all collection of field data), or verify health indicators against Ministry of Health data.  Food consumption indicators have been reviewed, but housing indicators are still measured by an excessive number of variables (74). Although the project's 5/83 termination - through which currently obligated funds are sufficient - makes institutionalization a paramount issue, the proposed creation of a Ministry of Planning (MIPLAN) analysis unit is outside the project design (as is a recent $20,000 contract with two U.S. economists); the remaining time should be spent on acquainting sector personnel with the project.  By contrast, the proposal to create a centralized information unit within MIPLAN seems a logical outcome of the project.  Recommendations include preparing a 100-page synthesis of the 2,000 pages of project working documents.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Statistical data|Data collection|Data analysis|Statistical analysis|Socioeconomic development|Development program planning","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP272.pdf","664 KB","000133 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the Philippine Government's (GOP) capability to measure the social and economic impacts of development projects, including their effects on women as both agents and beneficiaries of development. Special evaluation covers the period 6/78-2/82 and is based on document review and interviews with project participants and GOP and international organization officials. Overall, the project is making good progress. It is recommended that the Macro (national level) component: (1) fill in gaps in the published indicators with available data on poverty and income distribution; (2) use more recent underemployment data; (3) develop indicators of degrees of malnutrition; (4) provide a framework to link economic and social indicators with goals/social concerns; (5) attempt linkages with other project components; and (6) solicit Ministry of the Budget support for institutionalizing the ability to continue indicators work. Although the Women in Development (WID) component is not yet providing sufficient data for indicator development, its research outputs should be helpful in guiding indicator selection and strengthening WID policy and planning. The component has already substantially improved the state of women's studies in the Phillipines. The Region VI component should strengthen technical and managerial skills for its monitoring and evaluation system and develop linkages with other regional-level monitoring systems. The Micro component outputs are not yet meeting necessary standards of quality and usefulness. The Research Utilization component should orient its attention toward medium- and long-range questions: what levels of project impact assessment capacity are needed nationally and what steps can be taken to accelerate the development and utilization of this capacity. Overall, it is recommended that the project concentrate on areas with the greatest probability of sustainable growth.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Development projects|Impact assessment|Economic impact|Social impact|Women in development|National level|Regional development|Economic research|Research utilization","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP468.pdf","4500 KB","003720 - Philippine Institute for Development Studies","","000036 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase outreach efforts of the Thai Department of Agricultural Extension (DOAE), mainly by training DOAE extensionists. Final USAID/Government of Thailand (GOT) evaluation covers the period 1976-82 and is based on review of project reports and on questionnaires administered to project personnel and beneficiaries during site visits. Project accomplishments were significant.  Despite delays in signing the loan agreement and in obtaining contractors and shortfalls (by about a third) in both the World Bank's construction of regional, district, and subdistrict offices and the GOT's recruitment of extensionists, the DOAE initiated training for national and regional staff with minimal assistance and showed its growing organizational capacity by training and assigning personnel (a total of 5,300 vs. a target of 3,893) to all of the expanded (from 36 to 71) target of changwats (provinces).  There is clear evidence that contact farmers are adopting extensionists' recommendations, although greater efforts are needed to ascertain farmers' needs. On the negative side, the Civil Service Commission's failure to approve the proposed level of subject matter specialists (SMS's) per changwat reduced changwat ability to provide Kaset Tambon's (KT's - subdistrict extension agents) with pre-service and inservice training and ongoing technical support.  KT effectiveness has also been reduced by the GOT's inclusion of non-extension activities in their job description.  Finally, modifications in the training sequence and programs - treating extension methodology before the technical content - rendered practical participation contentless and made future application questionable. Key recommendations are to:  develop inservice training programs for all DOAE extensionsists; assign KT's to fill DOAE vacancies; gather more feedback from contact farmers; obtain reliable yield data from farmers; and have KT's make visits the year round.","Loan no. 493-T-019|Evaluation period: 8 Feb-5 Mar 1982","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural extension|Institution building|Technology adoption|Agricultural extension training|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP453.pdf","3,739 KB","008613 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the institutional capabilities for agricultural and rural sector planning and policy analysis in Latin American and Caribbean countries, principally through the assistance of the Inter-American Institute of Agricultural Sciences (IICA).  Special evaluation covers the period 1977-2/82 and is based on site visits and interviews with A.I.D., IICA, and other project personnel. Most targets have been met.  After development of a conceptual model of the planning process, a general planning survey was conducted in 23 targeted countries in the region.  English versions of both were subsequently published.  Case studies probing special aspects of planning were then conducted in five countries, resulting in the preparation of seven training publications.  The number of publications prepared has fallen short of plan, however, and delays in the preparation of the seven have occurred.  This resulted largely from a change in project direction away from the provision of formal training. A training manual was prepared by Iowa State University on price analysis and market intervention, but it is now being rewritten to be put into usable form. Seminars have been conducted for planning officials in Costa Rica, Peru, and Jamaica and the results published for wide distribution. Other seminars have been held in the Dominican Republic, Grenada, Dominica, and Panama in the areas of project evaluation and agricultural planning techniques.  Technical cooperation activities have been conducted in nearly every country in the region to provide assistance in policy analysis and operational planning to local Ministries of Agriculture where needed, but these activities have now begun to wind down.  As part of the network coordination and management component, the IICA has prepared reports for A.I.D., monitored project activities during 1981, and programmed future activities for the 1982-83 period. Network coordination activities have focused on both the inner IICA network and the linkage between IICA and country institutions or other international organizations. Four recommendations are made.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Development planning|Agricultural development|Institution building|Technical cooperation|Networks","Latin America|Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP511.pdf","841 KB","000180 - USAID.

"Evaluates Industrial Production Project (IPP) to improve Egypt's process for planning and allocating scarce investment resources. Special evaluation covers an undetermined period and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project implementors. The IPP has not achieved its objectives.  Major problems exist in execution; some elements need to be restructured.  The managerial resources of the Government of Egypt (GOE), individual company chairmen, and USAID have been drained by the IPP because none of the subprojects have been implemented.  When the IPP was first designed there was no clear strategy for industrial development. There was a need for industrial plant and equipment rehabilitation, but no plan on how best to apply IPP resources. There was an incomplete assessment of problems confronting Egyptian industries which led to such a general statement of IPP goals that it was unclear where resources should be allocated. Efforts expended on building institutional capacity often detracted from providing service and equipment directly to individual companies. Unclear design led to four major components not being effectively linked to each other, each component wound up as an end in itself.  The training component, for example, was not linked to either the environmental or the capital assistance components, except by subject matter.  Four IPP components were implemented by three separate contractors, but there was no avenue for coordination among them.  Key decisionmakers' roles were inadequately defined and often contributed to role conflict.  As a result of decisionmakers' conflicts, the needs of the public sector companies were neglected.  None of the key decisionmakers was aware of what the other decisionmakers did for the IPP. By emphasizing dissimilarities, the groups' communications were inhibited; procedures rather than results not only became more important but also crowded out investment decisionmaking. Project strengths include: a better awareness of the problems facing Egypt's industrial sector, experience in conducting feasibility studies, more discussion of structural reform, and greater experience in procedural issues.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Industrial development","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP513.pdf","1,846 KB","000394 - Coopers and Lybrand Associates, Ltd.","","008539 - USAID.

"Evaluates pilot project to develop materials, methods, and training techniques in participatory integrated nonformal education (NFE) for use by Nepal's Ministry of Education (MOE). Final Mission evaluation covers the period 7/78-7/81 and is based on an attached final report (XD-AAP-516-A). Focusing on the individual decisionmaker, the project, one of the first education projects in Nepal to be guided by a defined philosophy, developed five interesting and nonthreatening learning approaches - motivational, analytical, creative, planning, and didactic. Experimental techniques such as games, puppets, and drawing were used, and group discussions were led by trained village facilitators.  The project's emphasis on action programs proved effective, leading to attitudinal changes in villagers and to their participation in community activities (e.g., health, nutrition, agriculture).  The project's relatively high cost was due not only to its pilot nature but also to the difficult logistics requirements.  In the project's final year it was shifted by the Government of Nepal (GON) to the MOE as a first step toward integrating NFE with the already established functional literacy program. It is recommended that:  (1) the project's philosophy be continuously re-examined and improved; (2) action-oriented learning programs be further emphasized; (3) technical and professional staff be hired to train facilitators and supervisors and to develop materials and evaluate project progress; (4) the GON be prepared to support NFE programs in areas noted under (3); and (5) research be conducted to provide feedback on program progress. The positive nature of the evaluation was instrumental in a USAID/N decision to fund a follow-on project with the MOE.","Attachment: XD-AAP-516-A","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Pilot projects|Adult education|Nonformal education|Educational methods|Experimental education|Limited data","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP516.pdf","3,051 KB","008583 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen health education in Honduras through the systematic use of mass media, especially to promote the prevention and treatment of acute infant diarrhea.  Special evaluation covers the period 1/80-2/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with hospital and community officials and with mothers of small children. The project sought to develop health worker training and a public education campaign combining radio and graphic materials to promote the proper use of LITROSOL, an oral rehydration therapy (ORT) for infant diarrhea.  Interviews indicated that mothers had a positive attitude toward LITROSOL and did not find the treatment too complicated. Nevertheless, more publicity is recommended to promote ORT:  (1) for all types of diarrhea; (2) for the entire span of diarrheal episodes, especially in children under two years old; and (3) in combination with other remedies. Promotions should emphasize that sugar should not be added and that LITROSOL provides crucial fluid to prevent infant dehydration.  In sum, radio messages on ORT and breastfeeding have had considerable impact despite the prevalence of illiteracy and traditional customs and beliefs about breastfeeding and weaning.","Attached to PD-AAQ-003","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSAN-C-0023","","2/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Health education|Infant health care|Breastfeeding|Diarrhea|Oral rehydration therapy|Disease prevention and control|Beneficiary interviews","Honduras","","","003973 - Honduras.

"Evaluates health education component of a rural water and sanitation project in Honduras.  Special evaluation covers the period to 10/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel. Significant progress has been achieved.  The project has distributed 6,500 copies of 3 posters (on hand pumps, aqueducts, and latrines) and produced 3 promotional radio spots, 2 soap opera announcements, and an ongoing radio soap opera.  A comic book, a flip chart, 3 wall charts (on personal hygiene, latrines, water and sanitation), 20 radio program episodes, and 3 radio spots also have been designed and tested. Training has been provided to 95 new field promoters (FP's) in 2 courses on communications and health education and to FP's and others in 4 inservice courses on group dynamics, the use of flip charts, etc.; a consultant has been identified to help develop a set of group dynamics exercises for FP training. However, project implementation has been seriously hampered by: lack of an active Ministry of Health (MOH) health education director to assume full operational control and be trained as the project's communications specialist - the person appointed has been unable and unwilling to assume the role resulting in a decisionmaking vacuum (partially filled by an individual within the MOH latrine and well program without educational training or experience); ineffective incentives to encourage FP participation in training activities; overly-ambitious targets resulting in production of some overly-general educational materials; delays in material production which hindered FP's activities; and FP emphasis on one-to-one promotion (e.g, of individual latrine projects) rather than on community education and group decisionmaking which encourage long-term project success. Recommendations include to:  resolve the health education directorship issue by 1/83; develop an FP reward system; identify a consultant to help develop an educational campaign; use radio more (e.g., saturation spot campaigns, radio magazine programs); and identify a rural training expert to develop innovative FP training exercises to increase community participation.","Attached to PD-AAQ-003","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSAN-C-0023","","10/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Sanitation education|Health education","Honduras","","","000223 - Academy for Educational Development, Inc.

"Evaluates multi-donor project to promote irrigated agriculture at a 106,000 acre site along the Mahaweli River in Sri Lanka.  Donor review covers the period to 3/82 and is based on site visits and interviews with Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka (MASL) and other project personnel. Targets have been partially met.  Except for Block 419 and some 580 buildings throughout the H-area, the MDB's (unidentified acronym) construction of irrigation system infrastructure is essentially complete and the main and branch canals and the main control structures are operational.  However, despite the MDB's adherence to high engineering standards, eroded soils from the sides of some canals have been deposited in the canals, many control structures are either inoperable or unable to measure flows, and field canals cannot distribute water supplies equitably to all farmers in the project region.  Also, the MDB's development of social infrastructure and construction of wells for domestic use are significantly behind schedule, although the rate of well installation has recently improved. In other areas, on-farm development (OFD) work (among which land levelling is a compelling priority) and farmer settlement have been delayed by a changeover in project responsibilities from the MDB to the MASL's Settle Branch (MEA); the road system for the project area is nearing completion and some tree planting has begun; and covered wells built by MASL and handpumps provided by UNICEF and MASL are providing potable water in the project area (although service is still limited to government employees). Also on a positive note, there have been substantial improvements in the condition of AID-provided equipment for OFD and canal maintenance and in distributing the 3.5 ton trailers, although further effort is needed to dispose of the rest of the trailers, as well as the disc harrows and tine tillers. In view of the extensive work still needed on the irrigation system, USAID has scheduled further project reviews in 9/82 and 1/83.  It is recommended that the Tambuttegama workshop be reorganized and re-equipped for all maintenance operations in the project area.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural development|Water supply structures|Irrigation system construction","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ097.pdf","4,393 KB","008606 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to assist the Government of Liberia to improve its on-the-job vocational training (OVT) program for unemployed, untrained youths (aged 14-25) in Monrovia.  Special evaluation covers the period 7/79-7/82 and is based on document review and interviews with the chief of party and the project director. Despite an unexpected Liberian economic decline, the project has made a positive, if limited, impact on employment.  Between 1/81 and 4/82, 129 trainees (in auto mechanics, electronics, welding, carpentry, plumbing, cabinetmaking, etc.) were placed with 49 private/public employers.  However, in the main project shortfall, only 3 of 34 assignments between 1/82 and 4/82 went to women.  As some earlier trainees were ill-equipped for training, a general aptitude test has been introduced (with the 5/82 project revision) to aid in trainee selection/counseling.  Also, many individuals listed as trainees for as long as 5 years have been withdrawn and their places reassigned. The OVT training program has been upgraded with the recruitment of a director, a vocational counselor, a job developer, 4 trade specialists, 2 secretaries, 2 messengers, 2 custodians, 2 drivers, and 2 security guards.  Staff workshops have been conducted in task analysis, performance objectives development, OVT program administration, and the philosophy of vocational education for emerging countries.  Two instructors have completed short-term U.S. training; 2 others and an administrator are set to follow.  In addition, OVT staff have conducted orientation sessions for 98 participants to clarify employer/trainee and program staff responsibilities, prepared staff job descriptions, and developed data collection forms to monitor training results. Two short-term consultants have helped in aptitude testing and in the development of 40 supplementary learning activity packages (ready to be field tested and prepared for final printing) and have instructed staff on color slide processing and mounting. An 7/82 memorandum notes that project targets have been altered to reflect economic changes and to better incorporate women; a revised log frame is attached.  Recommendations are included.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","On the job training|Vocational training|Youth|Beneficiary count|Limited data","Liberia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ123.pdf","647 KB","008570 - USAID.

"Evaluates World Vision Relief Organization's (WVRO's) community development and community leadership training (COLT) activities in the Philippines.  Evaluation covers the period through 6/82 and is based on site observations, records from an A.I.D. audit report, and interviews with project staff, government officials, and COLT scholars. A.I.D. has received a high return on its modest investment. While the quality and permanence of some results may be questioned, WVRO projects (day care, feeding, schooling, etc.) illustrate the advantages of using a PVO to reach and serve poor and inaccessible populations.  However, WVRO must work to improve the balance between community dependence on government and the need for communities to develop independently; e.g., in one village, projects (day care, skill training, etc.) created new participation, hope, and confidence, but community self-reliance is new, while support from the Government of the Philippines (GOP) is weak and will disappear if WVRO departs.  Thus, WVRO must adapt to GOP actions and help villages develop a capability for self-government and for mobilization of community self-help income. A.I.D.'s expectations for the COLT program were too high.  The COLT approach alone cannot sustain impact, and it will require continued government TA and more time.  The Barangay scholar training program is good, but scholars by themselves without infrastructural support in villages do not make health or nutrition programs.  WVRO's approach minimizes possible intrusion of church/state issues that would violate the A.I.D. grant; COLT works through local institutions and relies on government. Despite inadequacies, WVRO data systems compare favorably to other PVO's, although measurement of project impact is hampered by absence of an adequate evaluation system.  However, improving that system is less important now than improving feedback and response to evaluation findings.  (FVA/PVC/ITA abstract.

"Evaluates project to assess the applicability of a host of renewable nonconventional energy technologies for use in rural Thailand.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/79- 9/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel and with specialists in renewable energy development in Thailand. While some progress has been made, implementation of most of the project's 14 components only began in mid-1982 (following long delays in contracting and preparation of workplans) and will probably not be completed within the project timeframe.  The project is overambitious (both as a whole and with regard to individual components), and planning remains deficient (component workplans are insufficiently detailed, no overall workplan exists, and planning in other areas - e.g., for technology dissemination and assessment, for handling components not completed by project end - has been inadequate). The composition of the project has changed frequently and is still experiencing minor changes.  Most of the planned energy resource assessments have been eliminated; only the solar and wind assessment remains, and this in curtailed form.  Project training has been cut drastically, and there may be no long-term academic training.  Also, some new technologies (gasification, industrial biogas) have replaced those originally planned (industrial conservation, conversion system integration).  It is suggested that a solar pond component be considered, and the utility of the micro hydro, survey, and energy master planning assistance components be reassessed. Although there has been some divergence among A.I.D., the National Energy Administration of Thailand, and some component leaders as to how the project is viewed, management and coordination have improved over the last year, mainly as a result of quarterly workshops.  The roles of all participants need to be redefined, and agreement must be sought as to the amount, nature, and origin of TA. Despite the project's problems, its goals for the most part remain valid and in some areas there has been signficant progress.  Provided are a series of recommendations which if adopted will allow the project to complete its objectives on time and within budget.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Renewable energy resources|Alternative technology|Energy planning|Energy research|Engineering research","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ512.pdf","24,296 KB","000439 - Development Sciences, Inc.","","008613 - USAID.

"Evaluates P.L. 480 Title III Food for Development program in Bangladesh.  Special evaluation covers the period 3/82-9/82 and is primarily based on site visits. Progress has varied by component.  Under the open market sales (OMS) program, foodgrain prices have generally been set as required and seem to have constrained consumer prices, although this impact has been weakened by restrictions imposed by local Government of Bangladesh (GOB) officials in regard to lot size, choice of commodity, and resale quantities and prices. Although modified rationing offtakes for the Public Food Distribution System (PFDS) far exceeded those of OMS through FY 1981-82, the GOB has made considerable progress in restructuring the ration system and the PFDS is being effectively reduced despite economic hard times.  A 12/1/82 law will put the ration price above the procurment price - a milestone in food and agriculture policy. In order to give farmers an incentive to increase output, the GOB has effectively kept procurement prices for rice at a realistic level. Despite GOB efforts to expand cotton spinning mills, economic conditions prevented the building of new private mills during 1982.  The GOB is pursuing the disinvestment of a large segment of the country's spindlage and power loom capacity. Due to the limited receiving capacity of Chittagong port for bulk oil and a number of other constraints, only 14,000 MT's of crude degummed soybean oil were shipped under the Title III program during FY 1982, although 10,000 MT of refined oil were shipped. Projects supported in part by Title III local currency generations (LCG) should be reviewed annually.  Also, improved LCG allocation and disbursement procedures are suggested. Development of the Food and Fertilizer Planning and Monitoring Secretariat has progressed adequately, although its economics section is not yet operational.  It has made good progress in tackling medium- and long-term food policy programs.  As part of the GOB's Medium-Term Foodgrain Production Plan, a host of foodgrain production/distribution, water control, and research/extension projects are in the process of being implemented.  However, the inputs needed to meet the target of food self-sufficiency by 1985 will not be available within the Plan's time frame.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title III|Agricultural product marketing|Food rationing|Agricultural prices|Soybean oil|Textile mills|Local currency|Food policy","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ514.pdf","2,696 KB","008511 - USAID.

"This study evaluates the training experiences of A.I.D. participants since 1975, analyzing the effects of socio-economic, demographic, and technical and non-technical factors on the following three stages of training:  pre-departure; training/living experiences in the United States; and impact of training on returnees in home country.  The study involved 650 respondents to written questionnaires which represents 50% of all participants returning between 1975-80.  Recommendations are made on pre-departure preparation, implementation of training, and on follow-up.

"Evaluates project to establish the Egyptian United Cooperative Society (UCS) as an institution capable of providing production capital and assisting private agricultural marketing cooperatives (AMC's). Special evaluation covers the period 9/79-2/82 and is based on site visits, interviews, and document review. Despite a delayed and somewhat misguided start, the project is not without promise.  The original project proposal, based on an unsolicited proposal by the Cooperative League of the U.S.A. (CLUSA), overestimated the Egyptian cooperative system's structural coherence, experience in managing credit programs, and ability to influence the market.  When CLUSA realized that marketing objectives could not be met, it deemphasized marketing, farm data collection and analysis, and training activities, and focused on institution building. Consequently, and despite serious staffing problems, the UCS's ability to develop and execute marketing plans, though still inadequate, has been strengthened. Most UCS marketing activities have built on ongoing AMC programs, but UCS itself handled the exporting of approximately 10% of members' potato production in 1981-82, and was thus able to increase potato farmers' incomes; UCS plans to increase its role in exporting potatoes and other produce.  Regarding credit, a revolving production fund is in place, but has been used at no more than 40% of capacity, partly because need for capital is no longer a major constraint to farmer production; there is no evidence of increased production due to the fund, however.  The project has made some contribution to lowering farmers' production costs through UCS production of seed potatoes. Finally, planned World Bank funding of infrastructure for produce storage, handling, and processing has not been made available. Since project objectives remain realistic, it is recommended that the project be extended one year.  Immediate action should be taken to: explore infrastructure financing by local village councils; design and implement a study/training program for UCS staff, including extensive short-term technical assistance; collect reliable farm survey data needed for project evaluation; and increase provision of production credit.","Attached to PD-AAR-026","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural cooperatives|Institution building","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAR026A.pdf","996 KB","008539 - USAID.

"Evaluates Catholic Relief Services (CRS) Title II food aid program in the Gambia.  Special evaluation covers the period 1978-82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with A.I.D., Government of the Gambia (GOTG), and CRS officials and with a random sample of beneficiaries and community leaders. The CRS program, consisting of 52 reporting centers scattered throughout Gambia, reaches women and children in 233 villages through distribution centers in some 86 village clusters; about 400 mothers and children attend each cluster.  While the FY83 program is intended to serve 30,000 persons, as many as 50,000 (some 50% under age 5 and 30% under age 3) have received food - diluted rations were of necessity provided - at a per person cost of $35.00 (vs. a planned $58).  It is unlikely that the food aid has a disincentive effect on food production; more probably, it enhances productivity. Management and accounting problems, revealed during a 1981 audit, have been corrected.  CRS now has very adequate logistical and administrative oversight systems and a generally capable, though numerically insufficient, staff, although field supervision needs strengthening.  Food is delivered regularly despite great difficulties. Most centers provide nutrition/health education, although type and quality thereof and level of participation vary; use of the CRS growth monitoring system by center personnel and mothers is satisfactory. Attendance at the centers is good even when less than full or substitute rations are given. The program's popularity at both national and local levels is impressive.  The GOTG has requested that CRS quadruple its beneficiary level over the next 5 years, but adding 20,000 beneficiaries a year, more gradual expansion (5,000 a year) is recommended so as not to endanger CRS's effort to deliver a program that is more than just food distribution.  Other key recommendations are to:  provide additional food during the stress (rainy) period; assess the program's nutritional impact; increase CRS coordination with USAID/G and the GOTG in addressing Gambia's nutritional needs; upgrade nutrition/health education and staff training therein substantially; and modify targeting criteria to permit wider coverage of underweight children.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title II|Maternal child feeding programs|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","Gambia","","","008545 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1977-1982) to conduct a study of migration patterns in Botswana.  The project was implemented by Boston University (BU). The migration study covered both internal migrations (rural-urban and rural-rural) and external migration (to and from mining jobs in the Republic of South Africa), and resulted in a 3-volume final report covering, inter alia:  migration flows, sizes, and composition; rural settlement patterns; determinants of migration decisions; the relationship between migration and such factors as schooling, employment, and role of women; and the economic effects of mine labor migration.  The project also sponsored three workshops, and its close liaison with various Batswana researchers resulted in a number of spin-off microstudies. Several lessons were learned from the project's survey component. (1) In carrying out national level surveys it is necessary to have an experienced person on hand from the beginning (the BU coordinator did not arrive until 10/78).  (2) Significant differences exist between a questionnaire designed for a national level survey and one designed for small-scale field research. The project questionnaire was too long, and presented conceptual difficulties for enumerators.  (3) A tabulation plan must be completed before the actual survey.  (4) Compatibility of the survey instrument with computer data processing must be assured. The project demonstrates some of the advantages of research projects (e.g., the potential benefits of combining quantitative survey research with in-depth qualitative microstudies), but it also shows that research projects (like all other projects) require close monitoring.  There was a serious lack of quality control over the 14 individual papers that comprise the project's final report.  Further, realization of the potential advantages of the qualitative microstudies was not achieved due to lack of monitoring. The most important lesson - is it cost-effective to fund pure research projects? - is yet to be learned, as it is not yet known whether the migration study's findings will be of use for policy planning purposes.  An evaluation should be conducted after Government of Botswana policymakers have had sufficient time to assimilate the project's final report.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Demographic research|Demographic surveys|Research utilization|Labor migration|Internal migrations|Return migrations|International migrations|Rural urban migrations|Survey methodology","Botswana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY949.pdf","92 KB","008516 - USAID.

"Evaluates integrated rural development project in Mauritania's Guidimaka region.  Special evaluation covers the period 6/80-3/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project officials and beneficiaries. Despite delays due to inadequate procurement and logistical planning and the financial and managerial weaknesses of the first TA contractor, progress has been good.  Cultural trials in 1981 yielded sharp increases in sorghum and cowpeas, while trials of improved cultural practices increased crop yields by 50% and helped, in conjunction with the provision of improved seed and nursery plants and water development activities, in promoting vegetable gardening.  The use of animal traction, especially for plowing, improved yields by 15% and led to expanded cultivated hectarage.  Promising work has been carried out in forestry and in range management but need to be complemented, respectively, by village level extension efforts and by a national policy to promote controlled access to land. The project team has worked patiently to make the new small-scale, self-help projects component -- which has had notable success in developing water resources and which should serve as a model for development activities in Mauritania -- acceptable to villagers, although its trial efforts to promote women's participation in the project have failed.  Animal health efforts, constrained by the lack of TA for long periods, have included creation of a revolving fund for the purchase of veterinary supplies at the village level. The success to date of the project, which has already become an institution responsible for large allocations of resources and manpower, stems largely from the mutual cooperation among expatriate technicians, their counterparts, and regional and national authorities.  Future efforts should stress indigenization of the project and development of a less costly extension methodology.  Expansion of activities beyond the project's small scope will depend on Mauritania's capability to support recurrent costs. Key recommendations are to:  update the project's financial plan and consider a project extension using existing resources; develop a plan to collect and analyze sociological data; and strengthen counterpart training.","English ed.: XD-AAM-487-A","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1982 12:00:00 AM","","Crop production|Integrated rural development|Agronomy|Rangeland|Agricultural research|Livestock|Reforestation|Agricultural extension|Animal health|Indigenization|Beneficiary interviews","Mauritania","","","008576 - USAID.
